APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Arthur Campbell Cooke, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Iran, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s August 4, 2015, decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a brief in opposition to the appeal. Proceedings will be reopened and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel such that his proceedings should be reopened. The Immigration Judge acknowledged that the respondent’s previous counsel did not file the application for relief from removal - specifically, cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) - within the time frame the Immigration Judge had set (I.J. at 1). However, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent’s own acts contributed to his counsel not filing the application, and therefore, he had not demonstrated that ineffective assistance had prejudiced the outcome of proceedings (I.J. at 2).
 
Upon our de novo review, we determine that the respondent’s proceedings merit reopening. We first note that the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed jointly with the DHS (I.J. at 1). Further, as noted above, the DHS has not filed an opposition to the respondent’s current appeal. Second, the respondent has met the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (I.J. at 2). The respondent’s previous counsel was aware of the filing deadline and did not file the cancellation application within the time frame set by the Immigration Judge or withdraw her representation of the respondent (I.J. at 1).
 
Thus, while we acknowledge the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent was afforded an opportunity to apply for relief, we do not agree that the application was waived, when the respondent affirmatively hired counsel to file the application, and counsel neglected to do so. Finally, the respondent is prima facie eligible for relief from removal and has submitted the relevant application. See Joint Motion to Reopen Proceedings filed June 15, 2015. Under the totality of the circumstances, we agree that the respondent’s proceedings merit reopening and the record should be remanded to the Immigration Judge for a hearing on the respondent’s eligibility for relief from removal under section 240A(a) of the Act. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

File: AXXX XX4 953 - New York, NY
May 19, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Chunyu Jean Wang, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 On January 14, 2016, the respondent submitted her third motion to reopen proceedings in which the Board dismissed her appeal on August 16, 2004. The motion will be denied.
 
To the extent that the respondent suggests that the Board committed error in not addressing issues relating to the Immigration Judge’s conduct of the hearing, this aspect of her motion is in the nature of one seeking reconsideration. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Whether treated as a motion to reopen or reconsider, the respondent’s motion is untimely, and as a motion to reopen it is also number-barred as it is her third such motion. Sections 240(c)(6), (7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6), (7); 8 C.F.R. § § 1003.2(b), (c)(2).
 
The respondent contends that reopening and/or reconsideration is nonetheless appropriate in light of misconduct on the part of the Immigration Judge, and as her first attorney gave her erroneous legal advice, preventing her from pursuing derivative asylee status. The respondent also asserts that other attorneys failed to raise or address the issues she now cites in her motion. As she avers that she experienced a gross miscarriage of justice and her due process rights were violated, she asks that proceedings be sua sponte reopened. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
However, the substantive basis for the respondent’s motion is that she was provided ineffective assistance by the numerous attorneys1 who have previously represented her in these proceedings. Despite this assertion, the respondent has not complied, even substantially, with any of the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against any of her various former counsels. Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133, 143 (2d Cir. 2007); Twum v. INS, 411 F.3d 54 (2d Cir. 2005); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). She correctly notes that her first attorney, who prepared her asylum application, was later disbarred (and was expelled from practicing before this Board on May 6, 2002). However, this fact alone does not exempt the respondent from any compliance with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against him or any of her other former attorneys.
 
*2 In this regard we note that her first attorney never appeared in person before the Immigration Judge on the respondent’s behalf. While an associate at his firm did appear on one occasion, that hearing was continued, and the merits of the respondent’s asylum claim were not reached (Tr. at 6-11). Thereafter the respondent appeared with other counsel, not associated with her first attorney’s law firm, with the Immigration Judge noting at the February 15, 2001, hearing that her first attorney had been arrested. Neither he nor anyone from his law firm was representing the respondent at the time of her merits hearing on April 28, 2003. Rather, the respondent had three other attorneys appear on her behalf during the remainder of her hearings (Tr. at 14, 30, 48, 58, 61). The respondent was also represented by three different attorneys during the course of her appeal and two prior motions to reopen. As such, the fact that her first attorney and/or his office was involved at the outset of the respondent’s case does not establish he was ineffective per se and does not excuse her failure to comply with any of the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against any of her subsequent former representatives. Therefore, reopening on this basis is not warranted.
 
As noted, the aspect of the respondent’s motion arguing a gross miscarriage of justice relative to the former-Immigration Judge’s handling of her case is in the nature of one seeking reconsideration. It is untimely by more than a decade. Section 240(c)(6) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). As indicated above, to the extent that the respondent avers that former counsel erred by not raising this issue, she has not complied with the requirements for reopening on such a basis. Twum v. INS, supra. The respondent has not identified any exceptional circumstance preventing her from such compliance, or which otherwise supports sua sponte reopening or reconsideration of her proceedings. Matter of G-D-, supra at 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (“As a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.”); Matter of J-J-, supra.
 
We further do not find that this case presents a gross miscarriage of justice as alleged by the respondent. We do not condone either the tone or non-judicious comments of the Immigration Judge. However, as the Board specifically declined to join in the Immigration Judge’s frivolous finding, the respondent was not precluded from pursuing adjustment of status, contrary to her arguments otherwise.
 
This case is also distinguishable from the situation presented in Matter of Farinas, 12 I&N Dec. 467, 471-72 (BIA 1967), wherein we found a gross miscarriage of justice. In that case the respondent’s deportation order, which was valid when entered, became invalid by virtue of controlling circuit precedent issued prior to the execution of the order. We further note that another case, Matter of Malone, 11 I&N Dec. 730, 731-32 (BIA 1966), also finding gross miscarriage of justice, is distinct from the respondent’s case as that respondent’s deportation order was clearly not in accord with the law as interpreted at the time of issuance. Neither of these situations is present here. Also, unlike those cases, the respondent’s arguments are largely premised on various claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Both the circuit where this case arises and the Board have clear precedential authority regarding the requirements for such claims, and the respondent has made no effort to comply with any of the same, nor explained why no action has been taken in this regard.
 
*3 As such, we find that the respondent’s motion is not exempt from the noted statutory bars, and the exercise of our sua sponte authority is not warranted. Therefore, we find that neither reopening nor reconsideration is warranted. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
AL Kola, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alexandra Kostich
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 20, 2015, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his October 14, 2014, removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
In his motion to reopen, which was not accompanied by an affidavit, the respondent alleged that his failure to appear resulted because he mistook the hearing date, believing it was on December 15, 2014. The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, finding that the respondent’s confusion regarding his hearing date did not constitute exceptional circumstances beyond his control that would excuse his failure to appear. See Uriostegui v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 660 (7th Cir. 2005) (concluding that mishearing the date uttered by the interpreter was nowhere near the illustrative examples of exceptional circumstances given in the statute).
 
On appeal, the respondent now alleges lack of notice and also avers that his prior attorney never informed the respondent of his court date. The respondent did not assert lack of notice in his motion to reopen, and he has not proffered an affidavit or explained why lack of notice was not previously alleged. Counsel’s arguments are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980).
 
*2 Ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an exceptional circumstance that excuses an alien’s failure to appear and allows reopening of the removal proceedings and rescission of a removal order. Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472, 473-74 (BIA 1996). However, the alien must satisfy the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) for claiming ineffectiveness of counsel. Specifically, the alien must: “(1) submit an affidavit establishing that she had an agreement with counsel to represent her and detailing its terms; (2) present evidence that she has given notice to her counsel of the ineffectiveness claim and an opportunity to respond to the allegations, and include any response she has received; and (3) if the attorney violated his ethical or legal obligations, show that she has filed a complaint with the governing disciplinary authorities or explain why she has not done so.” Lin Xing Jiang v. Holder, 639 F.3d 751, 755 (7th Cir. 2011) (citing Matter of Lozada). Satisfying the Lozada requirements “““is a necessary condition to obtaining reopening on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.” Id.
 
Here, the respondent has not identified who his prior attorney was. Nor has he fulfilled any of the requirements necessary for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, supra. Consequently, reopening on this basis is not warranted. See, e.g., Ghaffar v. Mukasey, 551 F.3d 651, 656 (7th Cir. 2008) (“Ghaffar did not comply with any of the Lozada requirements. Consequently, the Board acted well within its rights to deny his motion for remand”); Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498, 504 (7th Cir. 2001) (“[W]e have difficulty understanding how an alien who fails to comply with the Board’s criteria can succeed in challenging its decision”).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: YEFRI BERTIN SORTO-HERNANDEZ
File: AXXX XX6 187 - Charlotte, NC

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jonathan R. Maldonado, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa P. Durant
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals the Immigration Judge’s February 2, 2016, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On January 16, 2015, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed and the respondent waived appeal. On February 1, 2016, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a motion to reopen, requesting sua sponte reopening of proceedings to allow the respondent to apply for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”) (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2-3). The respondent also stated that he may raise a claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel, after obtaining additional information (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 4, fn 3). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposed reopening, arguing that the respondent did not assert exceptional circumstances to justify sua sponte reopening (DHS Opposition to Motion at 4). The DHS further asserted that, to the extent that the respondent was asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent’s motion should be denied for failure to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (DHS Opposition to Motion at 5-6).
 
On February 2, 2016, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion, finding that the respondent did not comply with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent appeals this determination.
 
In his motion to reopen and on appeal, the respondent claims that previous counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Along with his brief on appeal, the respondent has filed new evidence that he claims supports his assertion that his former attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel and that his actions prejudiced the respondent (see Respondent’s Brief at 7-9, see also attachments A-D). Among these documents is a letter written by the respondent’s prior counsel stating that although the respondent articulated a fear of return to El Salvador, no asylum application was pursued before the Immigration Court or the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) (see attachment D).
 
*2 The respondent has shown ineffective assistance of counsel, which justifies a remand. Based on the totality of the circumstances, we determine it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge to allow the respondent to pursue an application for asylum and related relief.1 The Immigration Judge should also consider whether, in accordance with section 235(d)(7)(B) of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), Pub. L. No. 110-457, 122 Stat. 5044  (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(C)), the USCIS has initial jurisdiction over any application for asylum and withholding of removal.
 
On remand, the parties should be given the opportunity to present additional evidence and arguments. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The removal proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and entry of a new decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rory H. Potter
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on July 9, 2015, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our April 28, 2015 affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s November 5, 2013 decision. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his 2004 removal order based on a change in the law. The respondent now filed a motion to reopen with the Board. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has opposed the respondent’s current motion. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
As the DHS correctly points out, the respondent’s motion, submitted on July 10, 2015, is both untimely and number-barred. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent acknowledges that his current motion is number-barred, but argues that sua sponte reopening is nonetheless warranted on the basis of the ineffective assistance of his attorney. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir. 2008) (“This court has held that a request for equitable tolling of a time- or number-barred motion to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is ‘in essence an argument that the BIA should have exercised its discretion to reopen the proceeding sua sponte based upon the doctrine of equitable tolling.”DD’ (internal citation omitted)).
 
The respondent’s attorney’s failure to meet the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit’s filing deadline for appealing the Board’s decision does not demonstrate a sufficient basis to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings. The respondent did not meet the procedural requirements to claim ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 496-98 (5th Cir. 2000) (upholding the Lozada requirements). In fact, the respondent has retained the same attorney for this motion to reopen. The respondent also does not demonstrate that he merits a favorable exercise of our discretion, after previously filing an untimely motion and failing to raise issues before the appropriate adjudicative body, and after we have twice previously declined to exercise our sua sponte authority. See generally Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “[t]he power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: ZENADO RUIZ-NIEVES A.K.A. ZENAIDO RUIZ-NIEVES
File: AXXX XX3 260 - Adelanto, CA
April 27, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven R. Espinoza, Esquire
*1 A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was mailed on December 21, 2015. The appeal was accordingly due on or before January 20, 2016.1 The record reflects, however, that the Notice of Appeal was mailed after the due date and filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on March 16, 2016. We conclude that the appeal is untimely.
 
In conjunction with the appeal the respondent files a motion to accept late-filed appeal.2 Counsel states in his February 29, 2016, declaration that his staff did not calendar the deadline to file the Notice of Appeal with the Board and did not bring the Immigration Judge’s decision to his attention until on or about February 9, 2016 (Motion Exh. B). We conclude that the respondent does not show substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to properly allege ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent does not present his affidavit regarding the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. His February 16, 2016, statement that he wants counsel to file an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen leaves many questions unanswered (Motion Exh. C).3 The second requirement is excused because counsel obviously knows about the allegations of ineffective assistance.
 
The respondent did not file a complaint against counsel with California state bar authorities or explain why not. Counsel did not self-report his ineffective assistance to California state bar authorities. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 825-26 (9th Cir. 2003) (failure to file bar complaint not fatal where former counsel submitted letter of self-report to bar); section 6068(o) of the Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code (duties of attorney). When an alien retains prior counsel to pursue an argument of inadequacy of that same attorney, the reporting requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, remain meaningful. It is not for the attorney to decide issues regarding his or her prior conduct. The self-reporting requirement lets a state bar decide and puts the state bar on notice if there are further problems, particularly problems of a continuing nature.
 
*2 We conclude that the respondent does not show substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada and we thus do not consider this appeal by certification. The Immigration Judge’s decision is therefore now final, and the record will be returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.
 
Because we are dismissing the appeal as untimely, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See sections 240(c)(6)(A) & (B) and 240(c)(7)(A) & (C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6)(A) & (B) and (c)(7)(A) & (C); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); see Matter of J- J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
In light of the foregoing, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to accept late-filed appeal is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed as untimely.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vera Alicia Weisz, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on October 22, 2015. By a decision of that date, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the decision of the Immigration Judge of April 1, 2014. The Board noted that the respondent had not provided any evidence with his appeal to establish his contention that a conviction had been vacated and did not submit a brief as had been indicated on his Notice of Appeal. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and seeks the reopening of proceedings and relief from removal. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion.
 
In the proceedings before the Immigration Judge and in the respondent’s appeal to the Board, the respondent was represented by Myava R. Escamilla who was disbarred by the California State Bar on October 16, 2015. Given the facts presented by this case, we find that the respondent has properly asserted a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See generally Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-640 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be granted and the record will be remanded for further proceedings to allow the respondent the opportunity to apply for any relief for which he may be eligible.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Genesis A. Peduto, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 6, 2015, which ordered him removed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but we review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed upon noting that no application for relief was filed and that no relief was available. We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. Although the respondent indicated on the Notice of Appeal that he intended to file a separate written brief or statement, no such submission has been received, despite counsel being granted the requested extension. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E). In the Notice of Appeal, the respondent states only that there was ineffective assistance of counsel and that counsel failed to file for any relief on behalf of the respondent. However, the respondent does not in any way comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Moreover, he has not identified any relief for which he may be eligible. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rebecca Kitson, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on May 6, 2015, at which time the respondent’s appeal of the decision of the Immigration Judge of September 25, 2013, was summarily dismissed. On August 3, 2015, the respondent filed the timely motion to reopen now before the Board alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The respondent has substantially complied with the process requisite to asserting such a claim. See generally Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-640 (BIA 1988). The respondent has provided a detailed affidavit describing the claimed ineffective assistance of counsel who is now deceased. Given the affidavit and other evidence presented, we find that reopening should be granted.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen is granted and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision. On remand, the respondent will have the opportunity to apply for any relief from removal for which he may be eligible.

IN RE: RICHARD ASARE
File: AXXX XX0 905 - Baltimore, MD

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gerald Karikari, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Andrew Kowalczyk
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent filed a motion to reconsider, considered timely filed, on January 29, 2016, after we issued a final removal order on December 16, 2015. Section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The motion, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), will be denied.
 
The Board’s December 16, 2015, order affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision denying a further continuance of the proceedings. We also upheld the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent had abandoned any application for relief from removal, due to his failure to file the application by the filing deadline. We noted that an Immigration Judge has authority to set deadlines for the applications, and may deem an application abandoned if not filed by a deadline. We noted that the respondent had been in removal proceedings for three years, and was granted six continuances. We agreed with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s desire to further recover from his April 2014 knee surgery did not establish good cause for a continuance. Nevertheless, the respondent did not file any application for relief by the deadline.
 
The pending motion does not establish any error of fact or law in our December 16, 2015, decision, or show that an argument was overlooked. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). While the motion suggests that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel from his prior attorneys, the assertions meet none of the procedural requirements for making such a claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent claims that his hearing was not fair, in that he was not provided a Twi interpreter. This claim was not made on appeal to the Board. Matter of Cervantes, 22 I&N Dec. 560, 561 n.1 (BIA 1999)(declining to address an issue not raised by party on appeal).
 
In any event, despite the respondent’s belated suggestion that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, or should have been provided with an interpreter, he does not show prima facie eligibility for any form of relief from removal. Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247, 251 (BIA 2007). While the respondent says that he is pursuing a visa application as a widower, no evidence of any such application is presented. Additionally, the Board in visa petition proceedings affirmed the DHS’ decision that the respondent failed to establish that his marriage to his now-deceased wife was legally valid.
 
*2 The respondent’s case also does not represent an “exceptional situation”, warranting reopening under our sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
The pending motion will, therefore, be, denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

File: AXXX XX9 728 - Orlando, FL

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marcela Gyires, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Richard Jamadar
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of December 4, 2014. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on January 18, 2007. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The record reflects that on April 24, 2006, an Immigration Judge terminated proceedings, finding that the respondent had shown prima facie evidence of U.S. citizenship. The DHS appealed, and on November 24, 2006, the Board sustained the DHS appeal, vacated the Immigration Judge’s decision, and remanded the case to the Immigration Court. As Mr. Pineda had entered his appearance before the Board by filing a Form EOIR-27, a copy of our decision was mailed to him.
 
The December 20, 2006, Notice of Hearing (NOH) for the January 18, 2007, hearing was properly mailed to the respondent’s counsel, Ralph Pineda, Esquire, who had previously entered his appearance in Immigration Court through the filing of a Form EOIR-28 (IJ. at 2, 4). The January 18, 2007, in absentia order was personally served on Mr. Pineda on the same date. In his September 18, 2014, motion to reopen in absentia proceedings, which was not accompanied by an affidavit from the respondent, the respondent alleges that he thought he need not appear because the Immigration Judge had previously terminated proceedings. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
On appeal, the respondent again alleges he should have been served with notice. However, the respondent has not established that notice to counsel was improper, and that it did not constitute notice to the respondent; nor has the respondent alleged or established ineffective assistance of counsel. To establish ineffective assistance of counsel as “exceptional circumstances” for an alien’s failure to appear, the alien must substantially comply with the procedural requirements set forth by the Board in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005). Lozada requires the alien to: (1) support the motion with an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel and what representations counsel did or did not make to the alien in this regard; (2) inform counsel of the allegations being leveled against him or her and give counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) state in the motion “““‘whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not.”DD’ Dakane, 399 F.3d at 1274 (quoting Lozada, supra, at 639). Here, the respondent has complied with none of the above-noted requirements, and consequently we find no basis to disturb the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carlos A. Piovanetti, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s November 17, 2015, order denying his October 19, 2015, motion to reopen. The respondent has also submitted evidence on appeal, which we construe as a motion to remand. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
A motion to reopen must generally be filed within 90 days of the date of a final order of removal. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent does not challenge the Immigration Judge’s determination that the motion to reopen was filed outside of this 90-day window (I.J. at 2). Instead, the respondent argues that the timeliness requirement should be equitably tolled in light of ineffective assistance of counsel he claims to have received during his removal proceedings (Form EOIR-26 at 2). See Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 713 F.3d 1357, 1362-65 (11th Cir. 2013) (en banc). Specifically, he claims that his prior attorney failed to fully consider his potential avenues for pursuing Special Immigration Juvenile (“SIJ”) status before advising the respondent to accept an order of removal.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not satisfied the procedural requirements for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 3). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); accord Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir. 2003). As the Immigration Judge properly noted, the respondent has not established that prior counsel has been informed of the present allegations or that a complaint has been filed with the relevant disciplinary authorities (Id.). See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. Thus, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not properly raised a claim for reopening on this basis, even under a lower “substantial compliance” standard. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 1222 (declining to decide whether substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements is sufficient); see also Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005) (assuming, without deciding, that substantial compliance is sufficient). The motion is therefore untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
*2 We also find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request for sua sponte reopening (I.J. at 3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). Absent evidence that the relevant state court order has been obtained, the respondent’s potential eligibility for a yet-to-be filed application for SIJ status is too speculative to warrant reopening at this point. See also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (explaining that sua sponte authority is reserved for truly exceptional situations).
 
Finally, we construe the additional evidence the respondent has submitted on appeal as a motion to remand. See Matter of L-A-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 516, 526 (BIA 2015). The evidence reflects the respondent’s ongoing efforts to obtain the relevant state court order needed to apply for SIJ status. For similar reasons discussed above, we are not persuaded that the respondent has met his heavy burden of establishing that the result in this case would be different if a remand were granted for consideration of this evidence. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carlos Piovanetti, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Denise C. Hochul
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of November 13, 2014. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on August 29, 2014. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal.1 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
The respondent moved to reopen proceedings, acknowledging that he had notice of his August 29, 2014, hearing, but alleging that a change of venue motion had been filed on August 22, 2014, and further asserting that due to the respondent’s limited economic resources and his misplaced belief his presence would be excused, he failed to appear at his hearing.
 
Contrary to the respondent’s assertion, the record does not reflect that the change of venue motion was filed prior to the August 29, 2014, hearing but instead it was only included in the motion to reopen filed on October 6, 2014 (I.J. at 3). Regardless, even had the change of venue motion been filed before his hearing, the “mere submission of a motion for change of venue does not excuse an alien’s failure to appear.” Romero-Morales v. INS, 25 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir. 1994). In addition, as noted by the Immigration Judge, although the motion included an affidavit from the respondent, it pertained to the enclosed motion to change venue, and does not address why he failed to appear at his hearing on August 29, 2014.
 
To the extent the respondent implied in his motion that he failed to appear because of ineffective assistance by counsel for failure to file the change of venue motion, he has not substantially complied with the procedural requirements for bringing an ineffective assistance claim. The requirements include submitting (1) an affidavit describing in detail the agreement with counsel, (2) proof that counsel was informed of the allegations and had an opportunity to respond, and (3) a statement regarding whether a complaint was filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and, if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988); Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that an “alien who has failed to comply substantially with the Lozada requirements ... forfeits her ineffective assistance of counsel claim.”).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent now alleges that he was unable to attend his hearing because he took his niece to a medical appointment on the date of his hearing, and he proffers a letter from a physician. We will construe the submission as a motion to remand and will deny the request. See Matter of L-A-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 516, 526 (BIA 2015) (“A motion to remand for the purpose of presenting additional evidence must conform to the same standards as a motion to reopen and will only be granted if the evidence was previously unavailable and would likely change the result in the case”).
 
We first note that the respondent has not adequately explained why this was not raised in the motion to reopen. The respondent’s counsel alleges that this evidence was not available because the respondent’s counsel “had not heard from respondent” when the motion was filed. However, the respondent’s failure to maintain contact with his counsel does not establish that the evidence was previously unavailable and could have been submitted or summarized with his original motion to reopen. See Li Yong Cao v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, All F.3d 149, 156 (2d Cir. 2005) (explaining that the BIA may decline to remand where the movant has failed to “comply with the requirement of 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(c)(1) [now found at § 1003.2(c)(1)] that his motion articulate material, previously unavailable evidence”).
 
Moreover, the respondent did not submit medical records or other corroboration to support his apparent claim that he was unable to attend his hearing because his niece suffered from a serious medical condition. See Alrefae v. Chertoff, 471 F.3d 353, 357-358 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting that “““[t]he BIA’s standard for exceptional circumstances appears fairly stringent, both in terms of the required severity of the circumstances and the proof required to establish a claim”); see also Matter of B-A-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 57, 58-59 (BIA 1998) (“Where an alien argues that his failure to appear resulted from a ‘serious illness,’ we normally would expect specific, detailed medical evidence to corroborate the alien’s claim.”). Because the doctor’s note did not clarify the severity of the respondent’s niece’s condition, the respondent has not established that his niece’s condition prevented the respondent from attending his hearing.
 
The Board has stated that “[n]otifying the Immigration Court of the respondent’s unavailability is a minimal and logical step that, if not taken, is a factor which tends to undermine a claim of exceptional circumstances.” Matter of B-A-S-, supra, at 57. Here, there is no indication that the respondent sent the doctor’s note to the Immigration Judge or notified the Immigration Court of his inability to be present prior to the hearing. Consequently, the respondent has not established that the proffered evidence would change the outcome of proceedings and remand is not warranted.
 
*3 The respondent has not established any exceptional circumstances to support sua sponte reopening. See generally Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (Board’s discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (Board and Immigration Judges retain authority to sua sponte reopen or reconsider proceedings in exceptional situations; sua sponte authority is not meant to cure filing defects or otherwise circumvent the regulations).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003. 1(e)(5).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In its opposition to the DHS motion for summary affirmance, the respondent’s counsel alleges that he has not received the briefing schedule, and he requests a new briefing schedule. The record reflects that two briefing schedules were mailed to the respondent’s counsel at the address he provided. One was issued on January 27, 2015, providing a due date of February 17, 2015, and then a second one was issued on January 28, 2015, providing a due date of February 18, 2015. There is no indication that either notice was returned by the postal service, and therefore no new briefing schedule will be issued.

The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia and a citizen of Venezuela,1 appeals from the Immigration Judge’s January 13, 2015, decision pretermitting the respondent’s application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(a), based on an approved Alien Relative Petition (Form I-130) filed by the respondent’s United States citizen wife. A motion to reopen filed with the Immigration Judge prior to the respondent’s filing of his appeal has been forwarded with the record for our consideration. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).2 The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a response to the appeal or the motion. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). The appeal will be dismissed; and the motion, denied.
 
We review findings of fact for clear error, including credibility findings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The following relevant facts are not in dispute. On or about March 21, 2001, the respondent entered the United States and remained until he departed in March 2006 (Respondent’s Brief at 1; I.J. at 3-4; Exh. 3 at 12; DHS Motion to Pretermit at 4). From 2001 to 2006, the respondent had no legal status in the United States (Respondent’s Brief at 1; I.J. at 3-4; DHS Motion to Pretermit at 4). The respondent re-entered the United States on May 11, 2007, and remained until his departure in June 2011 (Respondent’s Brief at 1-2; I.J. at 3-4; Exh. 3 at 12; DHS Motion to Pretermit at 4). On July 12, 2011, the respondent re-entered the United States as a nonimmigrant employee of an international organization (Respondent’s Brief at 2; I.J. at 4; Exh. 3 at 13).
 
*2 On May 13, 2013, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status because, among other things, USCIS determined that the respondent’s entries and departures render him inadmissible pursuant to section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I), for being an alien unlawfully present after previous immigration violations (I.J. at 2; Exh. 3 at 1-10).
 
The respondent’s nonimmigrant status as the employee of an international organization was revoked on December 4, 2013, pursuant to section 221(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1201(i) (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 4; Exh. 1). On December 5, 2013, the DHS initiated removal proceedings against the respondent, charging him as being subject to removal pursuant to sections 237(a)(1)(B) and (C)(i)(I) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(1)(B) and (C)(i)(I), because his nonimmigrant visa was revoked and because he failed to maintain or comply with the conditions of his nonimmigrant status (I.J. at 2, Tr. at 4; Exh. 1). On June 17, 2014, the respondent conceded removability and renewed his application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act before the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 4-5).
 
On January 3, 2015, the Immigration Judge found the respondent statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under 245(a) of the Act because he is not admissible (I.J. at 5). The Immigration Judge determined, inter alia, that the respondent was inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act because he had been unlawfully present in the United States for an aggregate period of more than 1 year between 2001 and 2006, departed, and then subsequently entered the United States without being admitted or paroled in 2007 (I.J. at 2-3, 5-6). The Immigration Judge further noted that no waiver is available to address the respondent’s inadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i) of the Act (I.J. at 5).
 
The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court on January 30, 2015 (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen). The respondent attached to his motion (1) his affidavit regarding his May 11, 2007, entry to the United States; (2) the results of a polygraph test; (3) a series of photographs which the respondent indicates were taken in Spring 2007; (4) a January 3, 2008, report regarding traveler inspections at United States ports of entry; and (5) a draft application for a waiver of grounds of inadmissibility (Form I-601) (Attachments to Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 1-70). However, the respondent perfected a timely appeal by filing a Notice of Appeal with this Board on February 12, 2015, prior to the Immigration Judge issuing a decision on the pending motion (Respondent’s Notice of Appeal). Accordingly, jurisdiction vested with the Board and the Immigration Judge was divested of jurisdiction over the motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of H-, 20 I&N Dec. 611, 612 n.1 (BIA 1992). That motion is now before us as a motion to remand, and the arguments are incorporated into the appeal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4); BIA Practice Manual Rule 4.2(a)(ii).
 
*3 The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in concluding that he is statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(a) of the Act (Respondent’s Brief at 3-11; I.J. at 2-5). Specifically, he maintains that he is not inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act because his application for adjustment of status is not an application for admission (Notice of Appeal). The respondent also argues that new evidence, submitted with his motion to reopen, establishes that he is not otherwise inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act because he was inspected and admitted when he entered the United States on May 11, 2007 (Respondent’s Brief at 8-11).
 
We will deny the respondent’s motion to remand. A motion to remand for the purpose of presenting additional evidence must conform to the same standards as a motion to reopen. Matter of L-A-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 516, 526 (BIA 2015). A motion to reopen will not be granted unless it appears to the Board that the evidence offered in support of the motion is material and was not available or could not have been discovered or presented previously. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988).
 
The respondent has not established that the evidence submitted with his motion is new or previously unavailable evidence that could not have been discovered or presented at the hearing before the Immigration Judge. The respondent’s counsel claims that he was unable to submit the evidence previously because he learned of the circumstances surrounding the respondent’s May 11, 2007, entry into the United States after the Immigration Judge issued his January 13, 2015, decision (Respondent’s Brief at 3; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 1, 3). However, the statements of counsel, which are not evidence, do not explain why the information was not previously discovered (Respondent’s Brief; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen). See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980) (uncorroborated declarations of counsel are not evidence).
 
As a result, the respondent’s motion is unsupported by new, previously unavailable evidence material to his claim. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent has made no allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel and he has not presented evidence to meet the procedural requirements for such a claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Therefore, we conclude that the respondent has not established an adequate basis for remanding the record with respect to the facts and circumstances surrounding the respondent’s May 11, 2007, entry into the United States.
 
*4 The respondent’s argument that his application for adjustment of status is not an application for “admission” as defined by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is inapposite because the ground of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act does not refer to an alien who seeks “admission,” but instead applies when any alien “enters or attempts to enter” the United States (Respondent’s Brief at 4-6, 8). Moreover, to be eligible for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, an alien must be “admissible” without regard to whether the alien is an applicant for “admission” as the term is used in the cases cited by the respondent (Respondent’s Brief at 5-6). See Leiba v. Holder, 699 F.3d 346, 352-56 (4th Cir. 2012) (construing the phrase “lawfully admitted for permanent residence” in section 212(h) of the Act); Bracamontes v. Holder, 675 F.3d 380, 385-87 (4th Cir. 2012) (same); Aremeu v. Department of Homeland Security, 450 F.3d 578, 581-83 (4th Cir. 2006) (construing the phrase “the date of admission” in section 237(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act).
 
As the respondent does not otherwise contest the Immigration Judge’s finding of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act nor does he claim eligibility for a waiver of this ground of inadmissibility, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act and, consequently, statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act (Respondent’s Brief; I.J. at 4-5).
 
We therefore decline to address the Immigration Judge’s alternative finding that the respondent is inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the Act. See Matter of L-A-C-, supra, at 526 n.7 (declining to reach alternative issues on appeal regarding ineligibility for relief where the applicant is statutorily ineligible for relief on other grounds). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The Notice to Appear (NTA) alleges the respondent is a citizen and national of Venezuela (Exh. 1). At a master calendar hearing held on June 17, 2014, the respondent claimed to be a citizen and national of both Colombia and Venezuela (Tr. at 4). As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent’s May 22, 2013, sworn statement indicates that he renounced his Venezuelan citizenship (I.J. at 1, n.2; Exh. 3 at 11).

On March 25, 2015, the Immigration Judge issued a decision on the respondent’s January 30, 2015, motion to reopen finding that he had no jurisdiction over the motion because the respondent had filed a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s January 13, 2015, decision with the Board. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). For purposes of this decision, we will refer to portions of the Immigration Judge’s January 13, 2015, decision as “I.J. at...”.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carlos R. Juelle, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Monica Mubaraki
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)] - Alien smuggler
 
 
APPLICATION: Suppression; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 1, 2014. In her decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to terminate removal proceedings, sustained the charge of removability, and ordered the respondent removed from the United States to Mexico. During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a brief that is styled as an appeal brief, but, substantively, it is a motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) filed a motion for summary affirmance. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed, and her request to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel will be denied.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). Since the respondent’s case arises subsequent to May 11, 2005, it is governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act. See Matter of S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 42 (BIA 2006).
 
This matter arises from a November 3, 2012, border stop at the Otay Mesa, California, port of entry (Exhs. 1, 3). As a result of events that occurred at the border station while the respondent was attempting to gain admission to the United States, the respondent was detained, and, based upon answers elicited by United State Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers, served with a Notice to Appear (Form I-862) and placed in removal proceedings (Exhs. 1, 3). On November 18, 2013, the respondent filed a motion to terminate the removal proceedings asserting that her acquiescence to smuggling her relatives into the United States was not an affirmative act; thus, she was not removable under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act for knowingly encouraging, inducing, assisting, abetting, or aiding any other alien to enter or try to enter the United States (Exh. 4). The DHS opposed the motion (Exh. 5). On January 7, 2014, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to terminate (Exh. 6). On April 29, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to subpoena the four CBP officers who encountered and interviewed her on or about November 3, 2012, when she applied for admission at the Otay Mesa, California, port of entry; the DHS opposed the respondent’s motion (Exhs. 11, 12). The Immigration Judge issued an interim decision in which she denied the respondent’s motion on May 28, 2014 (Exh. 14).
 
*2 On October 1, 2014, the Immigration Judge issued an oral decision that sustained the charge of removability under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act and ordered the respondent removed from the United States to Mexico (Exh. 1). The respondent timely appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent’s brief is styled as an appeal brief, but, substantively, it is a motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel and a request to suppress the testimony she gave on October 1, 2014. Specifically, the respondent asserts her former counsel’s performance was so deficient that the respondent’s due process rights were violated when her former counsel failed to present objections to the DHS’s evidence in support of the Notice to Appear, failed to submit a motion to suppress said evidence, filed defective motions to terminate and for subpoena, and failed to advise the respondent of her right to remain silent and, instead, encouraged her to testify (Resp.’s br. at 7-17; Exhs. 1, 3, 4, 11). She further requests her October 1, 2014, testimony be stricken from the record. It is these arguments we now address.
 
The respondent did not comply with any of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (Resp.’s br. at 9). See Al Ramahi v. Holder, 725 F.3d 1133, 1138-39 (9th Cir. 2013) (compliance with Lozada ensures that the Board has an objective basis for assessing the substantial number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that come before it); see also Tamang v. Holder, 598 F.3d 1083, 1090-91 (9th Cir. 2010) (failure to satisfy Lozada was fatal to ineffective assistance of counsel claim where ineffectiveness was not plain on face of record and petitioner failed to provide any information regarding his purported former counsel). Although compliance with Lozada is not required when the error is plain on the face of the record, there is no plain error in the present case. Tamang v. Holder, supra.
 
Moreover, we disagree with the respondent’s assertion that former counsel violated her due process rights by not objecting to the DHS’s evidence (two Records of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien, Form I-213s) for the respondent and the smuggled alien, a report from the CBP officer at primary inspection, and the Record of Sworn Statement in Proceedings of the smuggled alien (Form I-867A)) and by not filing a motion to suppress such evidence (Exh. 3 at Tabs A-D; Resp.’s br. at 9-11).1 As to the aforementioned evidence, the respondent has not presented a sufficient argument to support the conclusion that, had prior counsel objected to DHS’s evidence, such an objection would have been sustained or the outcome of the proceedings may have been affected (Resp.’s br. at 9-10). See Martinez-Hernandez v. Holder, 778 F.3d 1086, 1088 (9th Cir. 2015) (in an immigration proceeding, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires a showing of inadequate performance and prejudice); see also Torres-Chavez v. Holder, 567 F.3d 1096, 1100 (9th Cir. 2009).
 
*3 The Ninth Circuit has repeatedly held that, in immigration hearings, the sole test for admission of evidence is whether the evidence is probative and its admission is fundamentally fair; it has further held the admission of government documents like the Form I-213 is fair absent evidence of coercion or that the statements are not those of the alien. See Sanchez v. Holder, 704 F.3d 1107, 1109 (9th Cir. 2012); see also Espinoza v. INS, 45 F.3d 308, 310-11 (9th Cir. 1995) (rejecting argument that a Form I-213 is inadmissible as hearsay because “[t]he sole test for admission of evidence [in a deportation proceeding] is whether the evidence is probative and its admission is fundamentally fair”). The respondent presents insufficient argument on appeal that the DHS improperly coerced her or that she or the relative she smuggled did not make the statements contained in the evidence; thus, we conclude the DHS’s evidence was properly admitted (Resp.’s br. at 9-11; Exh. 3 at Tabs A, C, D). Based on the foregoing, we cannot conclude the respondent’s prior counsel prejudiced the respondent’s case when she did not object to the government’s evidence or move to suppress it. See Martinez-Hernandez v. Holder, supra; see also U.S. v. Lopez-Chavez, 757 F.3d 1033, 1041, 1043 (9th Cir. 2014) (to establish ineffective assistance of counsel in immigration proceedings in violation of the right to due process, a petitioner must show: (1)that the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case, and (2) prejudice).
 
Likewise, we disagree with the respondent’s additional assertion that former counsel erred by filing a defective motion to terminate that did not contain a declaration regarding her detention and an accompanying motion to suppress evidence (Resp.’s br. at 11-13). Contrary to the respondent’s argument on appeal, we do not consider the evidence obtained during her detention to be in violation of 8 C.F.R. § 287.8(c)(2)(vii) (Resp.’s br. at 12; Tr. at 37). Id. (prohibiting immigration officers from using threats, coercion, or physical abuse to induce a suspect to waive his or her rights to make a statement). The respondent cites no case law or other legal precedence to support the conclusion that, given the exigent circumstances of suspected alien smuggling, her length of detention, brief interrogations, and the CBP officers’ conduct was anything more than standard operating procedure (Resp.’s br. at 12, 15). We also note the presumption of regularity which presumes that public officers, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, have properly discharged their duties, including placing information on forms; no such “clear evidence to the contrary” exists here. U.S. v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996); see also Matter of Rodriguez, 13 I&N Dec. 746, 748 (BIA 1971) (discussing presumption of official regularity which attaches to the consular officer’s issuance of the visa in question). Based on the foregoing, we cannot conclude the respondent’s prior counsel prejudiced the respondent’s case by not including the respondent’s declaration with the motion to terminate and an accompanying motion to suppress. See Martinez-Hernandez v. Holder, supra; see also U.S. v. Lopez-Chavez, supra.
 
*4 We recognize the respondent’s prior counsel’s motion to subpoena the four CBP officers who encountered and interviewed the respondent on or about November 3, 2012, may not have fully comported with the requirements set forth in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.35(b)(2) (Resp.’s br. at 13-14; Exhs. 11, 14 at 3-4). However, the respondent’s case was not prejudiced because she did not cross-examine the CBP officers who prepared her Form I-213 and other relevant immigration documentation (Resp.’s br. at 14-15; Exh. 3 at Tab A). As previously noted, the test for admission of evidence is whether the evidence is probative and its admission is fundamentally fair and that the admission of government documents is fair absent evidence of coercion or that the statements are not those of the alien. Sanchez v. Holder, supra (determining that the Immigration Judge did not abuse his discretion by admitting Form I-213, even though the petitioner was not given an opportunity to cross-examine the preparer); see also Haile v. Holder, 658 F.3d 1122, 1128 (9th Cir. 2011) (“The sole test for admission of evidence is whether the evidence is probative and its admission is fundamentally fair.”); Espinoza v. INS, supra, at 309-10; see also Matter of Barcenas, 19 I&N Dec. 609, 611 (BIA 1988) (documentary evidence is admissible if it is probative and its use is fundamentally fair; absent evidence that a Form I-213 contains information that is incorrect or that was obtained by coercion or duress, the document is inherently trustworthy and admissible to prove removability). As previously noted, the respondent has not cited any case law or other legal precedence to support the conclusion that, given the exigent circumstances of suspected alien smuggling, the CBP officers’ conduct was anything more than standard operating procedure (Resp.’s br. at 14-15).2 Since we cannot conclude the respondent’s admissions of alien smuggling were made under coercion, and we see no other objection, the Immigration Judge’s admission of the Form I-213 was fundamentally fair and, thus, proper (Exhs. 3, 7). See Sanchez v. Holder, supra; see also Haile v. Holder, supra, see also Espinoza v. INS, supra. As such, even if we accepted the respondent’s allegation that her prior counsel filed a defective motion to subpoena the CBP officers who prepared the Form I-213, we cannot conclude it prejudiced her case. See Martinez-Hernandez v. Holder, supra; see also U.S. v. Lopez-Chavez, supra.
 
*5 Turning to the respondent’s argument that former counsel failed to advise her of her right to remain silent, the respondent’s brief does not contain a statement or affidavit to support this assertion, and the respondent’s counsel’s statements in the brief, without more, are not evidence (Resp.’s br. at 16). See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); see also Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Hence, we deny the respondent’s request to strike her testimony from the record, and decline to address this issue further.
 
In sum, we conclude the respondent’s numerous due process claims related to her former counsel’s performance are without merit. They collectively fail because the respondent has not shown her former counsel’s performance prejudiced the outcome of her proceedings. See Martinez-Hernandez v. Holder, supra; see also U.S. v. Lopez-Chavez, supra.
 
Finally, we conclude the Immigration Judge properly evaluated the issue of removability and found the respondent removable. The respondent does not seek any relief from removal either before the Immigration Judge or on appeal. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request to strike testimony from the record is denied.

As an aside, we further disagree with the respondent’s unsupported assertion that the Form I-213s were not properly authenticated after the DHS withdrew the DVD from the record; each one is signed by an authorized designee (Resp.’s br. at 15; Exh. 3 at Tabs A, C). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 287.6(a) and 1287.6(a) (an official record may be evidenced “by a copy attested by the official having legal custody of the record or by an authorized deputy”).

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: JENNY MARGARITA ACUNA-IBARRA
File: AXXX XX2 458 - Harlingen, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alary E. Piibe, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Caroline Clark
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s April 9, 2015, decision denying her motion to reopen. The respondent was previously ordered removed in absentia on July 19, 1999. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded only if the alien files a motion to reopen: (1) within 180 days after the date of the removal order in which she establishes that her failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances; or (2) at any time in which she establishes that she did not have proper notice of the hearing in which the removal order was entered. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); see also section 240(e)(1) of the Act (defining the term “““exceptional circumstances”).
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s March 13, 2015, motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances, finding the motion was untimely, and the respondent had not demonstrated due diligence in pursuing her claim. We agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
On appeal and in her motion to reopen, the respondent asserts that (1) she hired a person whom she believed to be an attorney and legal specialist to help with her immigration case, (2) this person advised her not to appear for her scheduled hearing, and (3) this ineffective assistance prejudiced her case. To the extent the respondent argues that she established exceptional circumstances based on ineffective assistance, such a claim is precluded as untimely, as the in absentia order was entered in July 1999, nearly 16 years prior to the filing of the motion to reopen. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
We note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this cases arises, has not yet determined if equitable tolling of statutory deadlines for ineffective assistance of counsel applies in immigration cases. The Fifth Circuit has previously stated that an alien’s request for equitable tolling on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is construed as an invitation for the Board to exercise its discretion to reopen proceedings sua sponte. See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir. 2008), abrogated by Mata v. Lynch, 135 S. Ct. 2150, 2155-56 (2015). In this case, the Immigration Judge made direct findings on the factors that would or would not permit equitable tolling in this case, separate from the sua sponte question. Specifically, he found that the respondent did not support her claim of ineffective assistance with sufficient evidence of compliance with the factors listed in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), as she did not provide details regarding the name of her purported representative, the name of his firm or office, or the location of their meeting (I.J. at 2). We therefore agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established that reopening is warranted under section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
*2 In addition, we find no basis for exercising our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings, in light of the respondent’s nearly 16-year delay in filing the instant motion (see also I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). The respondent contends on appeal that a late filing, even one delayed by several years, does not necessarily demonstrate a lack of due diligence (Resp.’s Brief at 10). However, the respondent also acknowledges that she was represented in immigration proceedings in pursuit of adjustment of status as early as 2013, and her attorney learned of the 1999 in absentia order of removal in July 2013 (Resp.’s Brief at 4-5). As such, we find unavailing her argument that she could not have investigated her removal order and pursued reopening prior to the filing of the instant motion in March 2015.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Osaruwense Igunbor, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Denise C. Hochul
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native of Niger and a citizen of Mali, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on June 1, 2007, after not appearing at a hearing. He appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 10, 2015, denying his June 9, 2015, motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that his non-appearance at the hearing was caused by “exceptional circumstances.” See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) (providing that a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal). The respondent’s motion was filed more than 8 years after the hearing, and it is untimely.
 
In addition, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny equitable tolling of the 180-day period to file a motion to reopen. The respondent has not complied with any of the procedural requirements for establishing that ineffective assistance of counsel caused his failure to appear, and he did not file his motion with due diligence. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We also do not consider evidence first provided on appeal. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984) (holding that the Board does not consider evidence first provided on appeal). Moreover, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny sua sponte reopening of these proceedings, inasmuch as an exceptional situation was not established. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s and the Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). In light of the foregoing, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

File: AXXX XX1 425 - Houston, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Olivieri Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s November 16, 2015, decision denying his motion to reopen the removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is the subject of an administratively final order of removal issued by an Immigration Judge on September 25, 2000. The respondent was physically removed to Mexico pursuant to that order on November 15, 2000.
 
On October 21, 2015, the respondent filed a “motion to reopen sua sponte” with the Immigration Court in which he requested that his removal proceedings be reopened. The Immigration Judge denied the motion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), which provides in relevant part that “[a] motion to reopen . . . shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States.” We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, which is in accordance with controlling precedent in this jurisdiction. See Ovalles v. Holder, 577 F.3d 288, 292-93 (5th Cir. 2009) (recognizing that the departure bar precludes sua sponte reopening of removal proceedings); Salgado v. Lynch, 609 F. App’x 233, 234 (5th Cir. 2015); cf. Garcia-Carias v. Holder, 697 F.3d 257, 265 (5th Cir. 2012) (noting that “Ovalles resolved the issue of the applicability of the departure regulation to the Board’s regulatory power to reopen or reconsider sua sponte.”)
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the record should be remanded because the attorney who filed his motion to reopen provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to request equitable tolling of the 90-day statutory deadline for such motions. The respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is deficient on its face, however, because the respondent has neither filed a bar disciplinary complaint against former counsel nor adequately explained why not, as required by Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). We deem compliance with the bar complaint requirement to be essential, for several reasons: it serves the long-term interest of policing the immigration bar; it deters meritless claims and increases our confidence in the particular claim’s validity; and it “serves to protect against collusion between alien and counsel in which ‘ineffective’ assistance is tolerated, and goes unchallenged by an alien before disciplinary authorities, because it results in a benefit to the alien in that delay can be a desired end, in itself, in immigration proceedings.” Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 604 (BIA 1996); see also Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-98 (5th Cir. 2000). “We consider the filing of such a complaint, or reasonably explaining why such was not done, to be a relatively small inconvenience for an alien who asks that he or she be given a new hearing in a system that is already stretched in terms of its adjudicatory resources.” Id. at 605. This last consideration is particularly weighty here, given that the respondent is seeking the reopening of removal proceedings that became final more than 15 years ago.
 
*2 In his appeal brief, the respondent claims that he did not file a bar complaint because former counsel “has acknowledged his ineffectiveness and immediately took steps to remedy the situation by referring Respondent to his present Counsel. . . .” (Resp. Brief at 15). This explanation is wholly unsubstantiated, however; a mere statement in the brief is not evidence. INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188 n.6 (1984).
 
Finally, the respondent has made no offer of proof on appeal regarding the evidence he believes former counsel should have presented in support of his equitable tolling claim. As a rule, an equitable tolling claim requires proof that the moving party “has been pursuing his rights diligently” and “that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.” See Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 750, 755 (2016) (quoting Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 649 (2010)). The respondent’s brief and supporting affidavit contain no indication of his diligence or of any extraordinary impediment to his filing of a timely motion to reopen.
 
In conclusion, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the removal proceedings. The following order will be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nina Bonyak, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Barbara Cigarroa
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative decision on November 24, 2015, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
Applicable regulations provide that a motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, a movant must satisfy the “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must show that competent counsel would have acted otherwise and that the alien was prejudiced. See Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5 Cir. 1994); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent has not established prejudice such that reopening is warranted. First, the respondent has not submitted any evidence along with his motion, including any applications for relief. More importantly, the respondent still has not established statutory eligibility for the relief. He was previously precluded from eligibility for adjustment of status based on his 1998 controlled substance conviction. He subsequently filed a motion for post-conviction relief which was denied. The respondent has not submitted any evidence with this motion to establish, nor does he argue, that his controlled substance conviction has since been overturned or is no longer valid for immigration purposes. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice from counsel’s actions or omissions such that he has established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. As such, the respondent’s motion is insufficient to meet his “heavy burden” of showing that it is likely that the result would change if the proceedings were reopened. See generally Matter of Coelho, supra. Therefore, we do not find that he has met his burden of showing that reopening of these proceedings is warranted. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(B)

Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
AMENDED ORDER
 
This matter was previously before the Board on August 17, 2015, when we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s April 21, 2015, order of removal. The respondent now moves to reopen proceedings alleging ineffective assistance by her prior counsel. The Department of Homeland Security opposes reopening. The motion will be denied.
 
The record reflects that the respondent was convicted on January 30, 2014, of conspiracy in the fifth degree, in violation of New York Penal Law § 105.05, for which she received a sentence of one year (Exh. 2, Tab B). The record further reflects that on January 30, 2014, the respondent was convicted of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, in violation of New York Penal Law § 110-220.16(1), for which she received a sentence of 18 months (Exh. 2, Tab B). On April 21, 2015, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States based on her concession, through counsel, to the charges listed in the Notice to Appear, and her failure to apply for any relief from removal. The Board summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision on August 17, 2015, after the respondent did not raise any challenges to the Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
The respondent now moves to reopen proceedings alleging that her former attorney rendered ineffective assistance in failing to challenge the removal charges or apply for any relief from removal. As an initial matter, we note that the respondent has complied with the evidentiary requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).1 However, the respondent has not established that she was prejudiced by her former immigration counsel’s actions. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556-57 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 Although the respondent states that she would be eligible for relief from removal if her conviction was determined to not be not an aggravated felony, she provides no specific authority or argument that her conviction under New York Penal Law § 110-220.16(1), which involved possession with intent to sell narcotics, is not an aggravated felony. We also find that the respondent has not presented a prima facie case for relief to support a reopening of proceedings. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (the Board may deny a motion to reopen based upon a failure to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought).
 
As an aggravated felon, the respondent is ineligible for asylum or cancellation of removal. See sections 208(b)(2)(A)(ii), 208(b)(2)(B)(i), 240A(a)(3) of the Act. An aggravated felony involving unlawful trafficking in controlled substances is presumptively a particularly serious crime rendering an alien ineligible for withholding of removal. See section 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act, Matter of Y-L-, A-G-, R-S-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 270, 273-77 (A.G. 2002) (aggravated felonies involving unlawful trafficking in controlled substances are presumptively particularly serious crimes). The respondent has not put forth any argument to rebut application of the presumption in this case.
 
As for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), we do not find that the respondent has established a prima facie case for protection to support her motion to reopen. The respondent indicates that she fears two men who were involved in the trafficking of drugs with her and her husband. However, she makes no claim that these men have ties to the government in Ecuador, nor has she provided any evidence or argument to establish that the Ecuadorian government would acquiesce with or be willfully blind to any torture perpetrated against the respondent. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1) (torture under the CAT must be “inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity”).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kimberly J. Trupiano, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law (conceded)
 
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; voluntary departure; remand
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s December 16, 2014, decision, denying his application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), for failure to establish prima facie eligibility, and denying his alternative application for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), based on insufficient evidence of good moral character. During the pendency of this appeal, the respondent filed a motion, styled as a motion to reopen, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and requesting remand of the record. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded. The record will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issued de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The following facts are not in dispute. The respondent, a native and citizen of Tonga, entered the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor and remained longer than authorized (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 4; Exh. 1). He is the beneficiary of an approved Alien Relative Petition (Form I-130) filed on his behalf by his United States citizen wife (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 4). At a hearing held in 2013, the respondent indicated his intent to apply for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(a) of the Act based on the approved visa petition (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 11). The Immigration Judge scheduled a final hearing on the respondent’s adjustment application for September 15, 2014 (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 14-15, 17).
 
At the respondent’s September 15, 2014, hearing, his then-counsel requested a continuance because the adjustment application was incomplete: the fingerprints and medical examination had expired, and the affidavit of support for the sponsor and joint sponsor were deficient (I.J. at 3: Tr. at 17-20). See sections 212(a)(1), (2), and (4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1152(a)(1), (2), (4) (outlining health-related, criminal, and public charge grounds of inadmissibility). Over the DHS’s objection, the Immigration Judge continued the respondent’s case until December 16, 2014 (I.J. at 4; Tr. 19, 21). However, at the December 2014 hearing, problems persisted with the sufficiency of the affidavits of support (I.J. at 4; Tr. at 23-27). The Immigration Judge declined to further continue proceedings and instead concluded that the respondent had not established his statutory eligibility for adjustment of status (I.J. at 4; Tr. at 27). The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s alternate request for voluntary departure on good moral character grounds (I.J. at 8). See section 240B(b)(l)(B) of the Act; see also section 101(f) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f) (defining good moral character).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent alleges that his inability to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status and voluntary departure was due to the ineffective assistance of his prior attorney (Resp. Brief at 2; Resp. Motion to Reopen at 2-5). This is essentially a request for remand, with requirements similar to those for reopening. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-73 (BIA 1992). Generally, such a motion will not be granted unless it states new and material facts, is supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material, and establishes a prima facie case of statutory and discretionary eligibility for the underlying relief sought. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992); Maatougui v. Holder, 738 F.3d 1230, 1240-41 (10th Cir. 2013) (confirming that a motion to reopen should be supported by new evidence establishing a prima facie claim to relief); Osei v. INS, 305 F.3d 1205, 1208-09 (10th Cir. 2002); Matter of Coelho, supra.
 
In support of remand, the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements articulated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Osei v. INS, supra, at 1209 n.2. The respondent filed a state bar complaint against his former attorney, advised the former attorney of the allegations against him, and submitted a motion supported by an affidavit detailing how the attorney’s performance was deficient and impacted the respondent’s case.
 
Specifically, the respondent alleges that his former counsel did not prepare him for the hearing, did not request that his wife file her taxes, improperly recorded information on the affidavit of support, and did not ensure that the joint sponsor’s affidavit was duly executed or supported by proof of his United States citizenship, resulting in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent could not overcome the public charge ground in qualifying for adjustment of status (Resp. Motion to Reopen at 7-8, Tabs 41-46; Tr. at 17-18, 20, 24-27). See section 212(a)(4) of the Act; section 213A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1183a (outlining the statutory requirements for the affidavit of support); 8 C.F.R. §§ 213a.2(a)(l)(i)(A), (ii), (v), (b)(1), (c)(l)(i)(C), (c)(2), (ii) (for the various requirements related to proper execution of the affidavit of support, who may file the affidavit of support, and the evidence required to demonstrate sufficient income in support of the affidavit). With his motion, the respondent also included a letter from an accountant stating that the accountant is working with the respondent’s wife to file her back taxes (Resp. Motion to Reopen at Tab 33). The respondent also alleges he was prejudiced when his attorney did not prepare him for questioning about his 2010 arrest, and that numerous family members would have testified on his behalf as to his good moral character if they had been asked to do so-- factors relevant to the Immigration Judge’s denial of voluntary departure for lack of good moral character (Resp. Motion to Reopen at Tabs 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22; I.J. at 6-8; Tr. at 27-51). See section 240B(b)(l)(B) of the Act.
 
*3 We find that remand is warranted in the interests of justice. The respondent has demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s lack of preparation and communication with the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.102(o), (r) (requiring an attorney before the Immigration Court to adequately prepare for all proceedings and maintain communication with the respondent); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640; see also Ochieng v. Mukasey, 520 F.3d 1110, 1115 (10th Cir. 2008) (requiring the respondent to demonstrate prejudice in order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel warranting remand). Here, for instance, the respondent’s prior counsel: (1) did not adequately inform him of the documents required to present a sufficient affidavit of support even after certain deficiencies were identified by the Immigration Judge; (2) did not prepare him for questions he might be asked about his criminal history in qualifying for voluntary departure; and (3) openly acknowledged the affidavit of support was deficient (Tr. at 17-21, 25-27; Resp. Motion to Reopen at 31-46). Moreover, prior counsel proffered no persuasive evidence to rebut the ineffective assistance claim, even though the attorney was notified of the respondent’s allegations. Many of the identified errors in prior counsel’s performance have been rectified by current counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we express no opinion as to the ultimate merits of the respondent’s applications for relief. In light of our disposition of this matter, we decline to address the respondent’s assertions on appeal that the record, as it was constituted before the Immigration Judge, supported a grant of adjustment of status or voluntary departure.
 
Upon remand, the parties will have an opportunity to supplement the record with any documentation or testimony they may choose to present relevant to the respondent’s applications for relief. However, we remind the respondent and his counsel that he is responsible for presenting a complete application for relief supported by the requisite documentary evidence. Failure to follow this instruction and any directives issued by the Immigration Judge may result in a finding that he is statutorily ineligible for any requested forms of relief. See, e.g., Matter of Interiano-Rosa, 25 I&N Dec. 264, 266 (BIA 2010).
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER; The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jaime Jasso, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)] - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)] - Crime involving moral turpitude
 
 
APPLICATION: Termination; remand
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s June 27, 2014, decision ordering him removed from the United States. The respondent requests that the matter be remanded to the Immigration Judge to allow the record to be supplemented with missing transcripts. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent, a native and citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, who became a lawful permanent resident of the United States in 1981, was properly charged as an arriving alien because he departed the United States in 2005, and did not return until 2008, thus abandoning his residency (I.J. at 2-3; Exh. 7). Accordingly, the Immigration Judge sustained the charged of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), and ordered the respondent removed to Trinidad and Tobago. The Immigration Judge did not make a determination as the respondent’s inadmissibility under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act (I.J. at 3).
 
The respondent does not challenge the finding of removability on appeal, but rather argues that he has been deprived of due process in his immigration proceedings because the transcripts of record are missing hearings from the first 2 years of his proceedings (Resp. Br. at 1-4). He argues that, as a result, he has been prevented from fully challenging his order of removal, and establishing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Resp. Br. at 1-4, 6-8, 11-12).
 
As the respondent correctly points out on appeal, missing transcripts are not a per se violation of due process (Resp. Br. at 9-10). United States v. Medina, 236 F.3d 1028, 1031-32 (9th Cir. 2001) (explaining, in an illegal reentry case, that missing immigration transcripts did not violate due process in immigration proceedings). In order to establish that a violation of due process has occurred, the respondent must still establish that the missing transcripts rendered his proceedings fundamentally unfair and that he was prejudiced as a result of that unfairness. Id.; see also Dent v. Holder, 627 F.3d 365, 373 (9th Cir. 2010); Colmenar v. INS, 210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 We are not persuaded that the respondent has been prevented from reasonably presenting his case on appeal in such a way that rendered his proceedings fundamentally unfair. While the absence of a transcript of proceedings surely affects the nature of appellate review, it does not completely deprive the alien of all means of challenging the errors below. United States v. Medina, supra, at 1032. The respondent could have explained the presence of errors below through his memory, other evidence in the record, or witness testimony. See id. The respondent has not attempted to do so here, and thus he has not shown that he was prevented from fully presenting his case. See id.
 
Furthermore, even if he had established a fundamental unfairness in the proceedings, he must still establish that he suffered prejudice as a result. In the context of missing transcripts, an alien must do more than offer a “vague assertion that, if a tape recording was available, he might be able to locate some defect in the proceeding.” Id. Here, rather than asserting that ineffective assistance of counsel had occurred, the respondent asserts that he believes he may have suffered ineffective assistance of counsel, but that he needs the missing transcripts to determine the nature of his claim (Notice of Appeal, Resp. Br. at 11-12). Without more of an assertion from the respondent about how he believes he was deficiently represented, we conclude that his claims on appeal amount to no more than speculation as to his plausible grounds for relief, which is insufficient to show prejudice. Id.; see also United States v. Corrales-Beltran, 192 F.3d 1311, 1318-19 (9th Cir. 1999); United States v. Alvarado-Delgado, 98 F.3d 492, 493 (9th Cir. 1996).
 
This is particularly true where, contrary to the respondent’s assertions on appeal, the respondent need not strictly comply with the filing and reporting requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), if ineffective assistance of counsel is plain on the face of the record (Resp. Br. at 11-12). See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 597-98 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent does not assert in any meaningful way that ineffective assistance was plain on the face of the record; nor does he allege what he believes the missing transcripts would prove, if they were produced. Accordingly, the respondent has not established that the missing transcripts prevented him from establishing his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
We also disagree with the respondent that he was prejudiced because the record contains no evidence of the charges against him or his plea to those charges. The Notice to Appear is contained in the record at Exh. 1. Further, while it appears that the respondent did enter earlier pleadings through his attorney, that were contained in the missing transcripts, he also submitted subsequent written pleadings (Exh. 16). The Immigration Judge acknowledged and relied on those written pleadings in rendering his decision (Exh. 16; Tr. at 17; IJ at 2). The respondent does not allege any error of his prior counsel in submitting these pleadings or explain why these are insufficient to establish the charges and his pleadings. Accordingly, the respondent has not established a due process violation that requires remand of this matter. The following orders will be entered.
  
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
*3 FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

IN RE: GUILLERMO LOPEZ A.K.A. GUILLERMO LOPEZ SANCHEZ A.K.A. MEMO LOPEZ
File: AXXX XX6 343 - Dallas, TX
January 29, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jered Dobbs, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In a decision rendered March 9, 2015, the Immigration Judge denied a joint motion to reopen and terminate proceedings without prejudice filed by the respondent and the Department of Homeland Security (the DHS) on August 8, 2014. The respondent timely appealed that decision. The appeal will be sustained and the parties’ joint motion to terminate will be granted.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, under the “““clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgement, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, entered the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor in 2001 (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). The respondent married a United States citizen and adjusted his status to that of a conditional permanent resident in 2005 (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). The respondent did not timely apply to remove the conditions on his residency; his joint petition to remove the conditions was filed approximately two years after the relevant deadline (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1; Joint Motion, Tab C). United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) denied the petition because it determined that there was not good cause for the late filing, and the DHS commenced these removal proceedings through issuance of a Notice to Appear, charging the respondent as removable because his conditional permanent resident status had been terminated (Exh. 1). Before an Immigration Judge, the respondent conceded his removability and sought to renew his joint petition to remove the conditions on his residency (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge set a date for the respondent to file the petition with the Immigration Court, accompanied by proof that the requisite filing fee had been paid (I.J. at 2). He did not file the petition; on February 15, 2012, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed (I.J. at 2; Joint Motion, Tab F).
 
In August 2014, the respondent and the DHS filed a joint motion to reopen and terminate proceedings before the Immigration Court, so the respondent could pursue adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255, before USCIS (I.J. at 2). Along with the motion, the respondent submitted: (1) evidence that his wife, through whom he originally obtained his conditional resident status, had filed a new visa petition on his behalf; (2) voluminous documentation of their eight year marriage; (3) a note from his former lawyer suggesting the prior attorney was responsible for the failure to file the petition to remove conditions before the Immigration Judge; and (4) his statement (Joint Motion, Tabs A, G, I, J).
 
*2 The Immigration Judge, observing the motion was not time or number barred because it was jointly filed, denied the motion because the respondent had not submitted proof that the visa petition had been approved, and thus the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent could not establish prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act (I.J. at 3-4). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iv). To the extent that the respondent’s former lawyer was at fault, the Immigration Judge found the respondent had not complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), in making a formal claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 4).
 
We disagree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that reopening and termination without prejudice is not warranted in this case (I.J. at 3-4). Notably, an agreement between the respondent and the DHS on an issue regarding the proper course of action “should, in most instances, be determinative.” See Matter of Yewondwosen, 21 I&N Dec. 1025, 1026 (BIA 1997). Here, the Immigration Judge concluded that the joint motion of the parties could not overcome the respondent’s failure to demonstrate prima facie adjustment eligibility because he did not have an approved visa petition (I.J. at 4 n.1). However, the standard for reopening is met when “the evidence reveals a reasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied. . . . We have not required a conclusive showing that eligibility for relief has been established.” Matter of S-V-, 22 I&N Dec. 1306 (BIA 2000) (citing Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 419 (BIA 1996) (emphasis added). In addition, contrary to the Immigration Judge’s assertion that an approved visa petition is a necessary prerequisite for reopening, we have specifically found reopening to be appropriate where a pending visa petition is supported by evidence establishing a sufficient likelihood that the visa petition will be approved. See, e.g., Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253, 256 (BIA 2002). In this case, there is a reasonable likelihood of the visa petition being approved, given the respondent remains married to the same spouse through whom he obtained his conditional permanent residence nearly 10 years ago. Matter of S-V-, supra.
 
Therefore, given the joint motion and the respondent’s evidence that the visa petition is likely to be granted, we will reopen these proceedings and terminate them without prejudice pursuant to the parties’ request. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
*3 FURTHER ORDER: The parties’ joint motion to reopen is granted, and the instant proceedings are reopened and terminated without prejudice at the joint request of the parties.

IN RE: EVERLINE GESARE NYABWARI
File: AXXX XX3 208 - Dallas, TX
January 22, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Kenya. The Board dismissed his appeal on September 26, 2013, and thereafter denied several motions. On November 13, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel of former counsel. The motion is denied.
 
The pending motion is untimely filed, as well as number-barred, and no exception to these restrictions placed by law on motions to reopen removal proceedings has been shown to be applicable here. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Further, we find no basis to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
We decline to equitably toll the time and number bar because the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). He argues that former counsel failed to continue to object to the admissibility of a Form I-9, and that this was ineffective assistance. We disagree. It is settled that a Form I-9 is admissible in immigration proceedings to support charges of removability against an alien and to determine his or her eligibility for relief from removal. Matter of Bett, 26 I. & N. Dec. 437 (BIA 2014).
 
Furthermore, it has been over 2 years since the appeal was dismissed, and the respondent has not adequately explained why he delayed in raising his current claims. See Rodriquez-Manzano, 666 F.3d 948, 955 n.7 (5th Cir. 2012) (regarding ineffective assistance, “current regulations impose what is effectively a due diligence requirement on post-1992 cases...”). There is, therefore, no basis for abrogating the motions deadline. Accordingly, the motion is denied. The request for a stay is denied as moot.

File: AXXX XX5 059 - San Diego, CA
December 15, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alary E. Piibe, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(C), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C)] - Controlled substance trafficker
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated May 8, 2014, denying his motion to reopen the proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against him on May 12, 1999. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including any determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent received proper notice of his removal hearing because he was personally served with the Notice to Appear along with notice of the time, date, and location of the hearing. Section 239(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a). With respect to his claim of exceptional circumstances, the respondent’s motion is untimely because he did not file his motion within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s decision. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge properly declined to equitably toll the applicable filing requirements based on the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The doctrine of equitable tolling applies when “despite all due diligence, [the party invoking equitable tolling] is unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of the claim.” Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001). Here, the respondent had been put on notice that he was in removal proceedings and was scheduled to appear for a hearing on May 12, 1999, when he was personally served with the Notice to Appear, along with notice of the time and date of the hearing, on April 25, 1999. The respondent’s claim that he spoke with an attorney on the telephone after he returned to the United States in 2000 (which would have been more than 180 days after the Immigration Judge’s May 12, 1999, decision) does not establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent bears the burden of establishing a basis for rescinding and reopening, and he has not provided sufficient details to make his claim persuasive. Nor did the respondent show substantial compliance with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Finally, the respondent did not show that he acted with the due diligence required for equitable tolling where his motion was filed 14 years after the filing deadline had passed. It was unreasonable for the respondent to take no steps to reopen his case for well over a decade based on the statement of an attorney who apparently declined to represent him. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir 2003) (person seeking to toll period for filing motion to reopen must show he has acted with due diligence).
 
*2 Finally, the respondent has not established an “exceptional” situation sufficient to warrant sua sponte reopening of the proceedings. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The respondent acknowledges in his motion that a Form I-213 (Exh. 2), detailing the basis for the removal charge, had been admitted into evidence at the 1999 hearing (Respondent’s motion at 4-5; I.J. at 2). Moreover, the respondent’s arguments regarding the sufficiency of the Immigration Judge’s decision could have been made years ago. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stacy Tolchin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Elly Laff
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This matter was before the Board on September 29, 2015, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent filed the present motion to reconsider our decision and to reopen proceedings on October 22, 2015, and filed supplemental materials that the Board received on November 4, 2015. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
In this matter, the Immigration Judge entered the removal order in 2006 and the respondent moved to reopen in the Immigration Court in 2015, approximately 9 years later. The Board affirmed the denial of reopening on grounds that the motion was untimely and that the respondent had not demonstrated an exceptional situation to warrant sua sponte reopening. In seeking reconsideration, the respondent argues that since there is no regulatory time limit for reopening sua sponte, his motion was denied for failure to meet a non-existent regulatory deadline. This is incorrect; sua sponte reopening was denied not for timeliness but for lack of an exceptional situation. The present motion does not identify any error of law or fact in our decision or argument that was overlooked. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); see also Matter of 0-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 58 (BIA 2006). The motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
The respondent also seeks reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board held in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), that due process rights may be violated, and the time and numerical limits for filing a motion to reopen may be tolled, when ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from reasonably presenting his case. An alien seeking reopening for ineffective assistance must show that he acted with due diligence. See Iturribarria v. I.N.S., 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003); Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090, 1096-97 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding that alien failed to act with due diligence in waiting 6 months after adverse Board decision before consulting with another attorney). Equitable tolling of a filing deadline is a form of relief that is extended “only sparingly” even in situations where a claimant has “actively pursued” his remedies. Irwin v. Dep’t of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990). Even if counsel’s performance was deficient (a question we do not decide), the respondent has not shown that he actively pursued his remedies; in particular, there is no satisfactory explanation for the delay of more than 1 year in moving to reopen after the respondent obtained post-conviction relief in a state criminal matter. The motion to reopen will therefore be denied as barred by the applicable statutory and regulatory time and number limits.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.

File: AXXX XX0 869 - Arlington, VA
December 7, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey A. Devore, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Temporary Protected Status
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals the May 22, 2013, decision of the Immigration Judge denying and deeming abandoned his application for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and ordering him removed from the United States. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge for a new hearing. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
The record before the Board indicates that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) denied the respondent’s application for TPS in 2004 for failure to document his eligibility. See Tr. at 20; Motion to Remand, Tabs A, B. The respondent through counsel filed a new TPS application with USCIS in 2012, even though he was then in removal proceedings. See Motion, Tabs O - Q. In the Immigration Court, the respondent submitted only the application form, without any supporting evidence or documentation. The Immigration Judge issued an order of removal, but also advised the respondent that he would grant a timely-filed motion to reopen with an application for TPS or cancellation of removal. See Tr. at 31-33. The respondent did not file a motion to reopen.
 
The respondent’s appeal brief and present motion to remand claim ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board held in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), that due process rights may be violated when ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from reasonably presenting his case and prejudice results. In Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), we held that an alien must show prejudice resulting from the ineffective assistance and will not establish prejudice if he does not document that he is eligible for the relief sought. See also Figeroa v. I.N.S., 886 F.2d 76 (4th Cir. 1989) (holding that even in a clear case of ineffective assistance, the alien must establish prejudice by providing objective evidence that he is entitled to relief).
 
The brief and motion do not document that the respondent is eligible for TPS. The appeal brief makes a conclusory claim of eligibility and the motion addresses counsel’s performance,1 but nowhere does the respondent point to documents establishing his eligibility. Prejudice from ineffective assistance is not shown.
 
The respondent cites Matter of Interiano-Rosa, 25 I&N Dec. 264 (BIA 2010), in arguing that the TPS application should not have been denied or deemed abandoned for failure to file supporting evidence. In that case, the alien timely filed his application for relief and timely filed numerous supporting documents, although he failed to file some documents as directed by the Immigration Judge. The Board held on these facts that the application should be adjudicated on the basis of the testimony and the timely-filed documents. In the present matter, the respondent filed no supporting documents at all (I.J. at 1). The Immigration Judge was correct in holding that the respondent’s testimony alone could not have established his eligibility for TPS (id.), as TPS requires documentation of eligibility in all cases. Therefore, the Immigration Judge properly pretermitted the respondent’s unsupported application.
 
*2 For the above reasons, the Board will affirm the removal order and deny the motion to remand.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; rescission
 
*1 On January 26, 2015, the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s October 29, 2014, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal entered on August 27, 2002. On April 22, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and rescind with the Board. On July 21, 2015, the Board denied the motion, and on September 14, 2015 the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen and reconsider with the Board. The motion will be denied.
 
In his prior motion before the Board, the respondent offered an affidavit in which he stated that he never received any notices from any government office for his removal hearing. The Board found the respondent’s affidavit to be inconsistent with his affidavit submitted in support of his motion before the Immigration Judge in which he stated that he did not have any problems with the mail at his address of record.
 
In his prior motion before the Board, the respondent also set forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), against the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Judge and on appeal before the Board, Martha E. Garza, Esquire. The respondent asserted that he did not tell Attorney Garza that he did not have problems with the mail at his address of record; Attorney Garza prepared the affidavit in English; and Attorney Garza had him sign the affidavit without having read it to him in Spanish. In response to the allegations against her, Attorney Garza stated that in accordance with her office’s routine practice, the affidavit was read to the respondent in Spanish for corrections and signature. Attorney Garza also reminded the respondent that he met and consulted with a former associate of the firm, Raed Gonzalez.
 
Raed Gonzalez is the respondent’s current attorney. With the instant motion, Attorney Gonzalez has offered a notarized affidavit in which he states that he was not personally involved with the respondent’s case when he was employed in the office of Attorney Garza, and he attests that “it was never (Attorney Garza’s) routine policy nor routine practice at the office to consistently read affidavits back to non-English speaking clients in their native language.” Attorney Gonzalez further states that “[f]requently attorneys and legal assistants in (Attorney Garza’s) office simply would type the declaration and take the signature of the client without reading it back to them.”
 
Attorney Gonzalez implies that Attorney Garza did not respond truthfully regarding her handling of the respondent’s case. Although Attorney Gonzalez’s affidavit impugns Attorney Garza’s integrity, the respondent has not offered evidence that Attorney Garza has been notified of, and given a chance to respond to, the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in the instant motion, or that a proper complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. See Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 648 (5th Cir. 2014) (counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed to respond before allegations of ineffective assistance are presented to the Board); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639 (setting forth the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board). We conclude, therefore, that equitable tolling of the filing deadline based on the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not warranted in this case. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). Further, it has not been shown that an exceptional situation is present in this case to warrant reopening sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal is denied.

File: AXXX XX3 104 - Seattle, WA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sandy Restrepo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ryan A. Kahler
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 19, 2014. The respondent has also moved for a remand. The motion will be denied and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under a clearly erroneous standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Upon our de novo review, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion for a continuance to pursue a “U” visa as a crime victim. See section 101(a)(15)(U)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U)(i). While the Immigration Judge did not specifically reference our precedent decision in Matter of Sanchez Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807 (BIA 2012), concerning the adjudication of such motions, we find that he nonetheless gave adequate consideration to relevant factors and properly ruled on the respondent’s motion.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.6; see also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009). Relevant factors for consideration where a continuance is based upon a U visa outlined in Matter of Sanchez Sosa include whether there is government opposition to the motion, evidence of an underlying crime that may serve as a basis for a U visa, and evidence that the alien is prima facie eligible for a U visa. In this instance, the motion was opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the respondent presented no evidence to show that the relevant visa petition (Form I-918) had been filed and was being processed, or that the respondent had obtained the necessary law enforcement certification to show that he qualified for the visa (Tr. at 9). See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14. Thus, the respondent failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for a U visa. Under the circumstances, we find that the respondent did not establish good cause for a continuance and we conclude that the Immigration Judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the continuance.
 
*2 The respondent’s motion to remand appears to claim that he received ineffective assistance from prior counsel. The motion is accompanied by a copy of a U visa petition, an unsigned law enforcement certification in support of the visa petition, and an affidavit in support the visa petition detailing an immigration fraud allegedly committed against the respondent. The motion is defective as a claim of ineffective assistance because the respondent has failed to substantially comply with the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective representation outlined in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (I.J. at 4). Given the vague nature of the affidavit underlying the Form I-918 concerning the alleged fraud and the equally vague descriptions of both prior and current counsel regarding the actions taken in connection with the filing of the Form I-918, we do not find that deficient representation is sufficiently plain on the record to excuse compliance with Matter of Lozada. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir.2000). Inasmuch as the respondent has not shown that he prima facie eligible for a U visa, we also find that he has failed to demonstrate the prejudice required to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance because he did not establish that he is prima facie eligible for the relief sought. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (an alien asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate prejudice); see also Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793-94 (9th Cir. 2005) (stating that an alien must demonstrate that prior counsel’s performance may have affected the outcome of the proceedings).
 
Effective January 20, 2009, an Immigration Judge who grants an alien voluntary departure must advise the alien that proof of posting of a bond with the DHS must be submitted to the Board within 30 days of filing an appeal, and that the Board will not reinstate a period of voluntary departure in its final order unless the alien has timely submitted sufficient proof that the required bond has been posted. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3). See Matter of Gamero, 25 I&N Dec. 164 (BIA 2010). The Immigration Judge provided the respondent with the required advisals and granted the respondent a 60-day voluntary departure period, conditioned upon the posting of a $500 bond. The record before the Board, however, does not reflect that the respondent submitted timely proof of having paid the bond. Therefore, the voluntary departure period will not be reinstated, and the respondent will be ordered removed from the United States to Mexico pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s alternate order.
 
*3 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: SERGIO CRUZ MONTER A.K.A. SERGIO CRUZ MONTES
File: AXXX XX2 222 - Buffalo, NY
November 24, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew C. Hagen, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michele Henriques
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated March 13, 2014, finding him removable from the United States, as charged, and denying his motion to suppress evidence.1 See Motion to Suppress (December 2, 2013). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge for the reasons stated therein. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The sole issue on appeal is the respondent’s request that we reopen these proceedings based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
A motion to reopen may be denied if the respondent: (1) fails to establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought; (2) fails to introduce previously unavailable, material evidence; or (3) is found not to be entitled to a discretionary grant of the relief sought even if the first two requirements are met. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992). With respect to the second ground, the regulations state that a “motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).
 
A motion to remand must conform to the same standards as a motion to reopen where the respondent seeks to present new evidence, but will only be granted if the new evidence “would likely change the result in the case.” See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). Here, the respondent seeks a remand based on a claim that prior counsel was ineffective for various reasons. See Respondent’s Brief at 8-11.
 
The respondent has not fulfilled the prerequisites for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Debeatham v. Holder, 602 F.3d 481 484-85 (2d Cir. 2010). On appeal, the respondent makes general allegations concerning what actions former counsel should have taken, but in lieu of setting forth the agreement with former counsel concerning what action would be taken and what counsel represented to the respondent, the respondent provides a statement in which he identifies several issues he claims that prior counsel did not appropriately address (Respondent’s Brief at Exhibit B). Debeatham v. Holder, supra, at 484-85. The record does not contain proof that former counsel has been notified of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond. Respondent’s current counsel indicates he sent prior counsel a letter and a copy of the respondent’s brief on appeal. The record does not contain proof that a complaint has been filed with the disciplinary authority, and we are not persuaded by the respondent’s statement claiming that he did not file a grievance with the New York State Bar Association because he was unaware of that option.
 
*2 However, even if the respondent had complied with the Lozada requirements, he has not shown prejudice resulting from counsel’s alleged deficiencies. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638. The respondent has not identified any relief for which he may be eligible, or submitted the appropriate application for relief and supporting documents, pursuant to 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sarah V. Day, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Iris Guerra Bravo
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent is a female native and citizen of Guatemala. On December 16, 2005, an in absentia order of removal was entered against her pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The respondent filed a motion to reopen on August 5, 2014. On August 22, 2014, an Immigration Judge denied the motion. The respondent now appeals from that decision. The respondent is not challenging that she received proper notice of her scheduled hearing on December 16, 2005. Rather, she contends that an unnamed notario gave her bad advice not to attend her hearing and that her motion is thus subject to equitable tolling. We disagree. The Immigration Judge properly found that the respondent has not shown that she received ineffective assistance of counsel, Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), to excuse her failure to appear at her hearing. Contrary to her claims, the record also reflects that when the Notice to Appear (NTA) was personally served on her, the respondent was advised in her native language, Spanish, of the consequences for failing to appear. See also Exhibit 2, Form I-213, at 3 (respondent indicated that she understood her obligation to report for her hearing). Lastly, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not shown that she is prima facie eligible for relief, such as withholding of removal or voluntary departure, to warrant reopening (I.J. at 2; Motion at 4).1 The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Johanna Cochran, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Diane Dodd
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals a May 21, 2015, decision by the Immigration Judge denying reopening of an April 2, 2015, decision, which ordered the respondent removed to Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security has filed a brief in opposition to the appeal. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge, under a clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen was a 21-page document alleging ineffective assistance of counsel against the attorney who represented him in his removal proceedings. He made specific arguments against said attorney, i.e., that his attorney erroneously told him that he did not have any other options other to accept his order of removal (Motion at 13-14). He also contends that his attorney did not inform him or his father that he had filed a stay of removal (Motion at 9). Furthermore, he contends that he is eligible for relief from removal (Motion at 15-20). He complied with the procedural requirements delineated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (Motion at 9-10).
 
The Immigration Judge did not discuss the respondent’s specific arguments in his motion, only issuing a one-page handwritten order, stating that the respondent twice confirmed that he agreed to the order of removal, waived appeal, and was satisfied with the representation he received from his counsel. The Immigration Judge’s conclusion does not sufficiently address the issues raised by the respondent’s motion. See Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994) (when a motion to reopen deportation proceedings is denied, the Immigration Judge must identify and fully explain the reasons for the decision; otherwise, the parties are deprived of a fair opportunity to contest the decision on appeal, and the Board is unable to exercise meaningfully its responsibility of reviewing the decision in light of the arguments advanced on appeal); see also Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999) (holding that because the Board’s fact-finding ability is limited, it is essential for Immigration Judges to include in their decisions clear and complete findings of fact that are supported by the record and are in compliance with controlling law). The respondent has argued that his agreement to removal and waiver of appeal were based on erroneous advice rather than a tactical decision.
 
*2 Accordingly, we find it necessary to remand the record for the entry of a new decision that more fully addresses, in light of the evidence in the record, the respondent’s arguments and the reasons for rejecting them.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the aforementioned decision.

IN RE: JOSE JESUS MORA-CARDONA A.K.A. JOSE MORA
File: AXXX XX6 459 - Memphis, TN
October 28, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Divyesh Gopal, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has filed a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 10, 2014, denying his request for a continuance and granting voluntary departure with an alternative order of removal from the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a brief or other response. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent failed to establish good cause for a continuance in his case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 355 (BIA 1983). In particular, the Immigration Judge correctly noted that the respondent had been granted two prior continuances, one providing nearly a year to obtain counsel and a second providing nearly another year to file all applications for relief (I.J. at 1-6; Tr. at 9, 16). The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent filed a request for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion (PD) with DHS approximately 2 days before the final hearing, the request was denied by DHS, and the respondent did not have any applications for relief pending on the date of the final hearing (I.J. at 3, 6; Tr. at 20). Compare Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009) (setting forth factors to consider when adjudicating a motion for a continuance based on a pending visa petition). The Immigration Judge correctly noted that DHS opposed the continuance request (I.J. at 5-6; Tr. at 21). Id.
 
On appeal, the respondent concedes that he had sufficient time to prepare his case (Resp. Br. at 7). He also notes that the decision of whether or not to exercise prosecutorial discretion lies solely with DHS, not with the Immigration Judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals (Resp. Br. at 7).
 
The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge failed to consider whether DHS was being reasonable in opposing the continuance request, where it was based on the respondent filing his PD request just 48 hours before the final hearing and the court’s filing deadline for all applications for relief (Resp. Br. at 7-8; Tr. at 21). See Matter of Hashmi, supra, at 791. It is clear from the Immigration Judge’s decision, however, that she concluded that the DHS’ opposition to the continuance was reasonable and supported by the record, and we agree with these conclusions (I.J. at 4-6). Id. The Immigration Judge properly concluded that the respondent did not exercise due diligence in pursuing relief from removal (I.J. at 5). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate good cause for a continuance under these circumstances, and conclude that the discretionary denial of the motion for a continuance was appropriate.
 
*2 The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge failed to consider the likelihood of success of his request for prosecutorial discretion filed with DHS (Resp. Br. at 7-8). However, the correct measure is the ultimate likelihood of success on any application for adjustment to lawful status in the United States, not whether or not a respondent’s removal proceedings might be administratively closed in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See Matter of Hashmi, supra, at 790. Moreover, the respondent has not provided any specific arguments or evidence showing that he warranted a grant of prosecutorial discretion. To date, the respondent has not shown that he had any prima facie approvable application for relief from removal pending on the date of the last hearing.
 
The denial of a continuance will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing, and here the respondent has not shown such. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987). Furthermore, contrary to his claim on appeal, the respondent has failed to show prejudice (Resp. Br. at 8). See Matter of Sibrun, supra. In particular, to date the respondent has not established that he had any applications for relief pending that were prima facie approvable, including a request for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion by DHS, as discussed above. Id.
 
On the Notice of Appeal, the respondent alleges ineffective assistance by prior counsel. This allegation is not accompanied by any specific details, and is not raised as an issue in the respondent’s brief on appeal. Furthermore, this allegation is not supported by any documentary evidence in compliance with any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (establishing ineffective assistance of counsel), nor does the record support a finding of per se ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Appeal Brief; Respondent’s Notice of Appeal; I.J. at 1-6; Tr. at 1-30).
 
Finally, we are unable to reinstate voluntary departure in this case. The Immigration Judge provided the respondent with the required advisals and granted the respondent a 60-day voluntary departure period, conditioned upon the posting of a $500 bond. The record before the Board, however, does not reflect that the respondent submitted timely proof of having paid that bond. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3). See Matter of Gamero, 25 I&N Dec. 164 (BIA 2010). Therefore, the voluntary departure period will not be reinstated, and the respondent is subject to removal from the United States pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s alternate order.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent is ordered removed from the United States to Mexico, pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s alternate order.

The appeal will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that the Immigration Judge should have continued removal proceedings to allow the respondent’s wife, a United States citizen, to pursue a Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) on his behalf and for attorney preparation (Resp. Brief at 2-4). However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argues that because the respondent accepted pre-conclusion voluntary departure, he waived his right to pursue an appeal (DHS Brief at 2-3). A condition of a proper grant of pre-conclusion voluntary departure requires the respondent to waive his right to appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D). Therefore, we must evaluate whether the respondent waived this right knowingly and voluntarily.
 
Here, the respondent does not argue that his waiver of appeal was not made knowingly and voluntarily. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320 (BIA 2000). Instead, the respondent expressly states he “is not appealing the grant of voluntary departure . . .” (Resp. Brief at 2). Notably, the respondent accepted this benefit with the assistance of counsel. The respondent, who has new counsel on appeal, has not challenged the effectiveness of his counsel below. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (outlining the requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); see also Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 2014) (requiring compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada). Absent egregious circumstances, which are not alleged in this case, the respondent is bound by the tactical decisions and actions made by his attorney when such attorney is acting in his professional capacity. Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938, 942 (BIA 1995) (citation omitted).
 
*2 Given this procedural posture, we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of the respondent’s appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39 (“[T]he decision of the Immigration Judge becomes final upon waiver of appeal . . . .”); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(a)(1) (“A Notice of Appeal may not be filed by any party who has waived appeal . . . .”); Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, supra, at 699 (“[I]nasmuch as the immigration judge’s decision is final, this Board lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the case before us.”). Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The record is returned to the Immigration Judge without further action.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marcia Kasdan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Delia Irene Gonzalez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of July 28, 2014. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia on November 29, 2011. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
The Notice of Hearing (NOH) for the November 29, 2011, hearing was mailed to the respondent’s counsel, Norma Sepulveda, Esquire, on February 23, 2011 (I.J. at 1).1 The respondent failed to appear at her hearing and an in absentia order was entered on November 29, 2011. The respondent filed a motion to reopen in absentia proceedings on July 8, 2014, alleging that she did not receive notice of her hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that Ms. Sepulveda’s representation was limited to bond proceedings. However, the record does not support this assertion. As noted by the Immigration Judge, Ms. Sepulveda filed a motion to withdraw on October 17, 2011, with evidence showing that the respondent was notified of her November 29, 2011, hearing (I.J. at 2). The fact that Ms. Sepulveda had withdrawn representation because the respondent intended to seek new counsel elsewhere does not excuse the respondent’s appearance at her November 29, 2011, hearing.
 
The respondent has not alleged or shown ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006); Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605, 609 fn.15 (5th Cir. 2006) (alien’s right to due process is violated when the representation afforded him was so deficient as to impinge upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing, and, as a result, the alien suffered substantial prejudice); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). To show prejudice, an alien must make a prima facie showing that, but for counsel’s error, she would have been entitled to the relief she sought. See Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994). Here, while the respondent contends that she would seek asylum, she has not specified the basis for her claim, nor has she provided the requisite application (Form I-589). The respondent has not demonstrated that she is prima facie eligible for any relief, and thus she has failed to establish she suffered any prejudice, even had there been ineffective representation. See, e.g., Ogunfuye v. Holder, 610 F.3d 303, 306-07 (5th Cir. 2010) (explaining that to prevail on a due process claim, an individual must demonstrate with substantial evidence that the error could have changed the outcome of proceedings).
 
*2 The respondent’s appellate contention that venue should have been automatically changed once the respondent was released from detention is unavailing. There was no basis for the Immigration Judge to do so in the absence of any request for a change of venue filed by the respondent.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Iris Guerra Bravo
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of August 5, 2014. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on November 28, 2011. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
The Notice of Hearing (NOH) for the November 28, 2011, hearing was mailed to the respondent’s counsel, Burhan Nomani, on April 8, 2011 (I.J. at 1).1 The respondent failed to appear at his hearing and an in absentia order was entered on November 28, 2011. The respondent filed a motion to reopen in absentia proceedings on July 8, 2014, alleging that he did not receive notice of his hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that Burhan Nomani’s representation was limited to bond proceedings. However, the record does not support this assertion. As noted by the Immigration Judge, Burhan Nomani filed a motion to withdraw on October 19, 2011, stating that the respondent is aware of his November 28, 2011, hearing, but had not maintained contact with counsel (I.J. at 2). The respondent has not alleged or shown ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006); Gutierrez-Morales v.

IN RE: LUIS EDUARDO MALDONADO-GOMEZ A.K.A. LUIS M. GOMEZ
File: AXXX XX3 121 - San Diego, CA
October 1, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Murray D. Hilts, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 30, 2015, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent became a lawful permanent resident on April 22, 1996. On November 15, 2004, the respondent was convicted of: 1) transportation of a controlled substance in violation of section 11379(a) of the California Health and Safety Code, and 2) disobeying a court order to prevent domestic violence in violation of section 273.6(a) of the California Penal Code. Due to these convictions, on August 18, 2005, the respondent was issued a Notice to Appear charging him with removability for an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B), and for violating an order of protection under section 237(a)(2)(E)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(ii). The respondent, through prior counsel, conceded removability and was ordered removed by an Immigration Judge on September 21, 2005. The respondent waived appeal.
 
On February 12, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, arguing that ineffective assistance of prior counsel prevented him from pursuing an application for cancellation of removal for lawful permanent residents during removal proceedings in 2005. Specifically, the respondent asserts that at the time of his removal proceedings, his conviction for transportation of a controlled substance was not an aggravated felony under controlling precedent; therefore, he would have been eligible to apply for cancellation of removal. On April 30, 2015, the Immigration Judge denied reopening, and the respondent now appeals.
 
In denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent was subject to the post-departure limitations on motions to reopen in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (I.J. at 1). Subsequent to the decision of the Immigration Judge, a precedent decision regarding the applicability of the departure bar to an alien’s statutory right to file a motion to reopen was issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In Toor v. Lynch, 789 F.3d 1055 (9th Cir. 2015) the court held that the text of Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (“IIRIRA”) makes clear that the an alien has a statutory right to file a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider removal proceedings and this right is not limited by whether an alien has departed the United States. Therefore, the respondent’s removal from the United States did not preclude his ability to seek reopening within the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit.1
 
*2 The respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was not filed within 90 days of the final administrative decision in his case, which was the Immigration Judge’s September 21, 2005, decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1). The motion, in which the respondent seeks that his proceedings be reopened to allow him to apply for cancellation of removal for lawful permanent residents, does not fall within any statutory or regulatory exception to motion time or number limitations. Section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3), 1003.23(b)(4).
 
In his motion to reopen and on appeal, the respondent claims that prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance. While we recognize that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen for the reasons that follow.
 
The respondent was not entitled to equitable tolling to toll the approximately 10 year delay in filing his motion to reopen because the respondent failed to show that he acted with “due” or “reasonable” diligence in discovering any “deception, fraud, or error” that prevented him from timely filing his motion. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2011); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). On appeal, the respondent asserts solely that after he was removed to Mexico, he was unaware of the deficient performance of prior counsel, and that he only became aware of it after he unlawfully re-entered without inspection sometime after September 21, 2005, and contacted an attorney in August 2014. That the respondent waited until August 2014 to seek advice is not a showing of due or reasonable diligence, particularly given that he has not shown or otherwise alleged that he was prevented from asking a relative or friend to contact an attorney, or doing so himself, sooner than 2014. Nor has he shown that any ignorance of the law was caused by circumstances beyond his control. See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001) (in order for equitable tolling to apply, the respondent needs to show that his ignorance was caused by circumstances beyond his control, and which go beyond a claim of excusable neglect). Accordingly, as the respondent has not shown that he warrants equitable tolling, the Immigration Judge appropriately denied his motion to reopen.
 
*3 Moreover, the respondent has not shown that his prior counsel’s allegedly deficient performance caused him prejudice, as the record does not demonstrate that prior counsel misapplied the law at the time of the respondent’s removal hearing. See Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893, 898 (9th Cir. 2008) (prejudice is established when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings). The respondent argues that he would have been eligible for cancellation of removal as his conviction was not an aggravated felony under controlling precedent. However, at the time of the respondent’s removal proceedings, there was no precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit or the Board that indicated that the respondent would have been eligible for relief. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated the requisite prejudice to support his claim, as he has not demonstrated that any alleged deficiencies of his former counsel affected the outcome of proceedings (I.J. at 2). See Iturribarria v. INS, supra, at 901-02.
 
Finally, we agree with the Immigration Judge that sua sponte reopening is not warranted (I.J. at 2). While we acknowledge that a fundamental change in law may be considered an exceptional situation warranting sua sponte reopening, we conclude that the respondent did not act diligently even after this change in law. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1134-36 (BIA 1999); Matter of G-C-L-, 23 I&N Dec. 359, 361 (BIA 2002) (explaining that because more than 5 years had passed since the enactment of new law, the interest of finality in immigration proceedings took precedence over sua sponte reopening an untimely motion to reopen to seek relief based upon that change in law). Further, considering the totality of the circumstances presented and alleged, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances sufficient to justify exercising his discretionary authority to reopen the respondent’s removal proceedings sua sponte (I.J. at 2). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The Immigration Judge also held that the respondent was precluded from filing a motion to reopen under section 241(a)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5) (I.J. at 1-2). We agree that were the respondent subject to the reinstatement of his prior removal order under section 241(a)(5) of the Act, the Immigration Judge would be without authority to reopen the respondent’s prior removal proceedings. See section 241(a)(5) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 241.8 (procedures for reinstating prior removal order). However, there is no evidence in the record that the Department of Homeland Security has issued the respondent a notice that his prior removal order will be reinstated or has otherwise sought to reinstate his removal order. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.8.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anish Vashistha, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael D. Steinberg
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The present motion to reopen, which is the respondent’s second request for reopening, is both untimely filed by many years and number barred and is denied on that basis. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The motion has not been shown to qualify for any exception to the time and numerical limitations imposed by law on motions to reopen removal proceedings.
 
Moreover, we decline to equitably toll the applicable filing requirements based on the respondent’s alleged ineffective assistance of former counsels claim. The respondent does not assert, nor does the submitted evidence reflect, that she was prevented from timely filing the present motion by “deception, fraud, or error.” See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2011); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
Moreover, we do not find that there has not been any showing of due diligence in pursuing the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra. The doctrine of equitable tolling applies when “““despite all due diligence, [the party invoking equitable tolling] is unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of the claim.” Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001). The respondent does not dispute that she was, at the very least, dissatisfied with the performance of her former attorneys at the time services were rendered by each. Nor does she dispute that she was aware of both the Board’s June 22, 2007, decision dismissing her appeal, and October 16, 2007, decision denying her first motion to reopen. Other than hiring current counsel, for which the respondent provides no dates or details, the respondent has offered no reasonable explanation for waiting almost 8 years from the Board’s last decision in this case to file the present motion. Under the circumstances, we do not find that the respondent has sufficiently demonstrated that she exercised due diligence in pursuing her ineffective assistance claim against former counsels.
 
Further, the respondent has not demonstrated sufficient compliance with the procedural requirements for advancing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 53 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). The submitted bar complaint packages noting that a copy of each package was sent to the corresponding counsel alone is insufficient to satisfy the requirement that former counsels be notified of the allegations against them and given an opportunity to respond. See Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 On this record, the respondent has not provided an adequate basis to excuse the fact that the present motion is both untimely and number barred. Nor has she identified an exceptional situation that would warrant reopening of these proceedings under the Board’s discretionary sua sponte authority. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN RE: MELVIN AVILA-MEJIA
File: AXXX XX8 303 - Denver, CO
September 22, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lee Knox, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Aminda B. Katz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; withdraw pleadings
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s November 6, 2014, decision denying both his request for a continuance and his motion to withdraw pleadings. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent’s contention that he should have been able to withdraw pleadings is without merit. See generally Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (finding that a respondent is bound by the tactical decisions made by his counsel). As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent did not specifically assert or describe any egregious circumstances surrounding his pleadings. While the respondent proffered a 1-page personal affidavit in support of his Motion to Withdraw Pleadings, he does not raise any argument on appeal that persuades this Board that the affidavit established a prima facie case that egregious violations of the Fourth Amendment or other liberties that might transgress notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the probative value of the evidence obtained occurred. See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1050-51 (1984). Moreover, the respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel; nor has he complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
We also find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision declining to grant the respondent’s request for a continuance. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). As the Immigration Judge noted, since initiated in September 2012, the respondent’s removal proceedings have been continued on multiple occasions. Further, as the Immigration Judge noted, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) indicated that it declines to exercise prosecutorial discretion in this case.
 
Additionally, as an alien who has not been admitted to the United States, the respondent is statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). In addition, the respondent did not submit an application for adjustment to the Immigration Judge and has submitted no evidence on appeal reflecting that he has an application for adjustment pending before the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), or that he is eligible for any other form of relief from removal. Thus, a continuance to afford the respondent an opportunity to pursue adjustment of status or any other form of relief is and was not warranted.
 
*2 Finally, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent a 60-day voluntary departure period, conditioned upon the posting of a voluntary departure bond in the amount of $500.00 to the Department of Homeland Security within five business days from the date of the order. The record reflects that the respondent submitted timely proof of having paid the voluntary departure bond. Accordingly, the period of voluntary departure will be reinstated.
 
In sum, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s resolution of the respondent’s claim. The respondent on appeal raises no other claims to relief. Accordingly, we will enter the following orders.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(f).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thomas S. Rome, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Leigh Mapplebeck
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Peru, who is subject to an order of removal entered on February 19, 2015, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated June 11, 2015, denying his late-filed motion to reopen. The respondent has also filed a motion for stay of removal. The respondent’s appeal fee waiver request is granted. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed, and the motion will be denied as moot.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. We have considered the totality of the respondent’s claims on appeal, including his claim that he wishes to challenge his removability and to be granted time to pursue collateral relief for a criminal conviction, and conclude that no basis was established for granting the motion.
 
As pointed out by the Immigration Judge, the respondent’s motion is untimely (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Nonetheless, the motion may be considered a motion for sua sponte reopening. Sua sponte authority is an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
A main basis on which reopening was sought is alleged ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of the respondent’s previous attorney. However, the general procedural requirements for presenting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim have not been complied with, and no argument has been made that the procedural requirements should be waived. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec.637 (BIA 1988) aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Furthermore, the respondent does not challenge on appeal the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen insofar as that denial rejected an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. I.J. at 1 (June 11, 2015). Therefore, we need not address the issue further.
 
The Immigration Judge issued an oral decision on February 19, 2015. No appeal was taken from that decision, and the decision became final on March 23, 2015.1 Significantly, the respondent does not argue that he attempted to file an appeal, so no procedural issues involved with misfiled or lost appeal forms are before us.
 
While the respondent’s appeal brief mentions legal arguments relating to the question of removability, that question has been decided in a final order, and, except in rare cases, we do not grant a sua sponte motion based on an argument that could have been made on direct appeal. See generally Matter of J-J-, supra. The respondent’s expressed disagreement with the Immigration Judge’s legal conclusions, and his expressed dissatisfaction with the length of the hearing, are in the nature of an attempt to revive an appeal. The respondent has made no persuasive claim that there was, in this case, a miscarriage of justice that might support a finding that extraordinary circumstances exist for a sua sponte grant of reopening. See, e.g. Matter of Farina, 12 I&N Dec. 467, 471-72 (BIA 1967); Matter of Malone, 11 I&N Dec. 730, 731-323 (BIA 1966). We acknowledge, specifically, that the respondent disagrees with the Immigration Judge’s treatment of the statute under which he was convicted as being a categorical match for an aggravated felony.2 Without expressing an opinion as to the merits of this specific issue, we note that the respondent has not cited to any authority that compels the result he seeks, and his disagreement with the Immigration Judge on this matter of law does not constitute a basis for sua sponte reopening. We also acknowledge the respondent’s assertion that the Immigration Judge did not provide a full and fair hearing, but the respondent has not supported that assertion with specific and persuasive arguments, and upon review of the record, we find no basis for concluding that a full and fair hearing was denied.
 
*2 The respondent also mentioned the potential of collateral relief from his criminal conviction. However, as the respondent has presented no evidence that he has sought such relief, we need not address that issue further.
 
Upon consideration of the totality of the record, we agree ultimately with the Immigration Judge that reopening is not warranted. Accordingly, as we decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

The record contains a memorandum of the court’s Decision and Orders, which indicates that appeal would be due by March 23, 2015. While the decision was recorded, no transcript was made of the decision, as no direct appeal from the decision was filed. A recording, which the Board has reviewed, exists of the hearing at which the oral decision was read; we take administrative notice that the recording is consistent with the Immigration Judge’s description of the decision. I.J. at 1 (June 11, 2015). We note that the respondent has not indicated that he or his counsel have been prevented from reviewing that recording.

The Notice to Appear indicates that the respondent was convicted, in November, 2004, in the state of Connecticut, of three counts of the offense of Assault on Public Safety/Emergency Medical Personnel, in violation of C.G.S.A. § 53a-167, for each of which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year. The Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion indicates that the Immigration Judge had found that statutory provision to be a categorical match for an aggravated felony crime of violence.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paola M. Alvarez de Bennett, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Iran, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 7, 2014, denying his motion to reopen. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Court as discussed below.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including the questions of credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, submitted on May 1, 2014, finding that the motion alleges the same grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel as asserted in the respondent’s first motion to reopen filed on or about February 27, 2014. The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent’s motion was number-barred because it was a second motion to reopen filed in this case. Finally, the Immigration Judge declined to sua sponte reopen the respondent’s proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
In the motion to reopen, the respondent argued that the motion to reopen time and number limitations should be equitably tolled in his case (May 7, 2014, I.J. Motion, at 12-14). However, the Immigration Judge’s decision did not address these arguments. The respondent again argues on appeal that the motion to reopen time and number limitations should be equitably tolled and that he has diligently pursued his claims (Resp. App. Brief, at 7-12). Furthermore, while the respondent’s second motion to reopen repeats essentially the same ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his first counsel, it also included evidence of the respondent’s compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), as well as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his second counsel in failing to make an adequate ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the respondent’s first motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge’s decision did not sufficiently address these arguments. Therefore, before we can perform a meaningful appellate review, we find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge to address the respondent’s arguments presented in the motion, including his arguments regarding equitable tolling of the motion to reopen time and number limitations in light of applicable legal principles. See Mahamat v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1281, 1283 (10th Cir. 2005); Galvez Piñeda v. Gonzales, 127 F.3d 833, 838-39 (10th Cir. 2005); Infanzon v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 1359, 1362-63 (10th Cir. 2004); Riley v. INS, 310 F.3d 1253, 1257-58 (10th Cir. 2002). Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with this order, and for the entry of a new decision.

File: AXXX XX8 123 - Salt Lake City, UT
September 3, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Peter Duong, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Tonga, was ordered removed in absentia by an Immigration Judge on February 19, 2008. He filed a motion to reopen on March 18, 2014, which was denied by the Immigration Judge on April 3, 2014, and the respondent timely appeals. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not replied to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
It is undisputed that the respondent had notice of his hearing. The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, finding that the respondent failed to establish “exceptional circumstances” prevented his appearance. The fact that the respondent was afraid that he might be ordered removed if he appeared for his hearing did not constitute exceptional circumstances beyond his control that would excuse his failure to appear. See section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1); Tang v. Ashcroft, 354 F.3d 1192, 1194 (10th Cir. 2003) (holding alien has “the burden of establishing exceptional circumstances warranting rescission” of the removal order).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that he was not advised of the consequences of failing to appear at his hearing. As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent was represented by counsel, who waived the reading of the advisement of the respondent’s requirement to appear (I.J. at 2). To the extent the respondent maintains that his counsel failed to properly advise him, he has not complied with the requirements to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Tang v. Ashcroft, 354 F.3d 1192, 1196-97 (10th Cir. 2003) (no abuse of discretion in the Board’s denial of a motion to reopen where the alien alleged ineffective assistance of counsel but failed to comply with any of the Lozada requirements).
 
*2 The record also reveals that the Notice to Appear (NTA) was personally served on the respondent and the NTA lists, inter alia, his address obligations and failure to appear warnings in English (Exh. 1). There is no statutory or regulatory requirement that the address advisals and failure to appear warnings in the NTA be provided orally or in the respondent’s native language. Current law does not require that the NTA be in any language other than English. See section 239 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229. See also generally Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d 354, 359-60 (5th Cir. 2009); Lopes v. Gonzales, 468 F.3d 81, 84-5 (2d Cir. 2006) (“We reject Silva’s claim that the notices to appear were defective because they did not advise him in his native Portuguese that an in absentia order could be entered against him if he failed to appeal.”); Flores-Chavez v. Ashcroft, 362 F.3d 1150, 1155 n. 4 (9th Cir. 2004); Nazarova v. INS, 171 F.3d 478, 483 (7th Cir. 1999).
 
Moreover, we note that a motion to reopen alleging exceptional circumstances for a failure to appear at a removal hearing must be filed within 180 days of the order of removal, and only one such motion is allowed. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i) & 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent’s motion, filed 6 years after entry of the in absentia removal order, claiming that he failed to appear at the hearing due to exceptional circumstances was untimely, as it was filed well beyond 180 days after the removal order was entered (I.J. at 3).
 
The respondent also proffers evidence that a visa petition has been filed on his behalf. In Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998), the Board held that an alien may reopen for purposes of pursuing previously unavailable relief in circumstances where he was not given oral warnings in his native language of the consequences of failing to appear at a deportation hearing and where the motion complies with the general time limits governing motions to reopen. The motion is untimely filed, however, and thus reopening on this basis is not warranted.
 
We deny the respondent’s request to have transcripts prepared. See Board of Immigration Appeals Practice Manual, 4.2(f)(ii), at 47, available at http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/qapracmanual/BIAPracticeManual.pdf#page=55 (providing that transcripts are not normally prepared for appeals of denials of motions to reopen, including motions to reopen in absentia proceedings). As noted above, the respondent, through service of the NTA at the very least, was properly advised of the consequences of failing to appear, and thus transcripts are not warranted here.
 
*3 For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David E. Walters, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Patrick W. Lindemann
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 16, 2013, finding him removable as charged and granting him voluntary departure. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is subject to removal from the United States because he is an alien who is present in this country without being admitted or paroled or who arrived at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General (I.J. at 2). See section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). As the respondent is subject to removal from the United States, it is his burden to establish eligibility for relief from removal. See section 240(c)(4)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d).
 
The respondent has not established that, in light of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, these proceedings should be remanded to the Immigration Judge. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Magallanes-Damian v. MS, 783 F.2d 931 (9th Cir. 1986). In particular, the respondent has not established that his former counsel’s performance was so deficient that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. While the respondent argues that his former counsel should have pursued a claim to immigration benefits under the Department of Homeland Security’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program, neither the Immigration Judge, nor this Board can grant the respondent DACA benefits. See generally Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 349-350 (BIA 1982). Instead, if the respondent wishes to pursue DACA benefits, such a request must be filed with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”). Moreover, the respondent has not established that he is prima facie eligible for DACA.1 Furthermore, we note that aliens who are subject to final orders of removal are eligible to request DACA benefits. Thus, the respondent has not established that his former counsel has divested him of the ability to pursue DACA benefits.
 
*2 Considering these circumstances, we conclude the respondent has not shown, in the absence of the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, that a remand of these proceedings would be appropriate based upon his not having established prima facie eligibility for DACA.
 
Lastly, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent a 60-day voluntary departure period, conditioned upon the posting of a $500 bond. Effective January 20, 2009, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3)(ii), an alien granted voluntary departure shall, within 30 days of filing an appeal with the Board, submit sufficient proof that the required voluntary departure bond was posted with the Department of Homeland Security. If the alien does not provide timely proof to the Board, the Board will not reinstate the period of voluntary departure in its final order. Id. The record before the Board does not indicate that the respondent submitted timely proof of having paid the voluntary departure bond. Therefore, the voluntary departure period will not be reinstated, and the respondent shall be removed from the United States on the charge contained in the Notice to Appear, pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s alternate order. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent is ordered removed from the United States pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s alternate order.

IN RE: ELIZABETH SILVERO-OVIEDO
File: AXXX XX0 047 - Harlingen, TX
August 24, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ronald S. Salomon, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 26, 2009, when we upheld an Immigration Judge’s order denying a motion to reopen proceedings that were conducted in absentia on October 14, 1998. The respondent has now filed another motion to reopen these removal proceedings. The motion, to which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded, will be denied.
 
In seeking rescission and reopening of the in absentia removal order, the respondent reiterates a claim, previously raised and rejected by both the Immigration Judge and the Board, that the government did not provide her with proper notice of her October 14, 1998, removal hearing. She also appears, for the first time, to fault Jesus Pena, the attorney who assisted her in pursuing a visa petition through her United States citizen spouse after her removal hearing, for her failure to appear at the hearing. The respondent also seeks reopening of these proceedings to apply for adjustment of status based on the now-approved visa petition filed by her United States citizen spouse.
 
We find no basis to rescind the in absentia order and reopen these removal proceedings. First, we have already considered, and rejected, the respondent’s claim that the government did not provide her with adequate notice of her hearing (Board Order dated October 26, 2009). We decline to revisit that issue now.
 
Second, to the extent that the instant motion is based on any alleged ineffective assistance by Pena, it is untimely filed years beyond the general 180-day deadline for seeking rescission of an in absentia removal order based on exceptional circumstances. See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), 1229a(e)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). We further note that the respondent has failed to comply with the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948, 954 (5th Cir. 2012) (acknowledging the Court’s rejection of a flexible approach to the Lozada requirements).
 
Finally, to the extent that the respondent now seeks reopening of these removal proceedings to pursue new relief in the form of adjustment of status, independently of her in absentia claims, the instant motion is untimely and has not been shown to fall within any of the exceptions for motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2) & 1003.23(b)(1) (a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order); Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349, 356-57 (BIA 1998). We also do not find exceptional circumstances that would warrant reopening these proceedings pursuant to our discretionary sua sponte authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lingling Dai, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent has submitted a timely motion to reconsider the Board’s April 30, 2015, decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings in which the Board dismissed his appeal on December 18, 2014. The motion is denied.
 
In denying the respondent’s motion, the Board found that he had not demonstrated compliance with the procedural requirements for reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). With his motion the respondent has submitted various documents, including a supplemental submission indicating that he filed a “preliminary inquiry” with the Committee on Professional Standards on June 17, 2013. This submission is in the nature of a motion to reopen, which is both time and number barred. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, we observe that this document confirms that neither of the two other such forms that the respondent filed with his prior motion to reopen were submitted to the noted committee, as he had alleged. As such, while we find no error in that regard, we do acknowledge that he has provided evidence that he filed a complaint as required by Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
However, we find no error in our determination that the respondent has not provided evidence that he informed his former counsel both of the complaint filed against her and of the contents of the complaint, and provided her an opportunity to respond, as required. Id.; Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644 (5th Cir. 2014). Contrary to the respondent’s suggestions otherwise, we are not required to accept as true his unsupported factual allegations. The respondent’s reliance on case law from a circuit outside the one in which this case arises for this proposition is unavailing (Motion at 4-5). Rather, we apply the law of the circuit in cases arising in that jurisdiction, and are not bound by a decision of a court of appeals in a different circuit. Matter of Salazar, 23 I&N Dec. 223, 235 (BIA 2002). As we find no error in our determination that the respondent did not satisfy the requirements for reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, reconsideration is not warranted. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN RE: JOAO BATISTA RIBEIRO
File: AXXX XX9 835 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
August 21, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Katelyn M. Hufe, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Charles Ireland
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on February 20, 2015. By a decision of that date, the Board dismissed the appeal of the decision of the Immigration Judge of June 26, 2013, which found the respondent removable as charged and denied his motion for a continuance. By the February 20, 2015, decision, the Board also denied a motion to remand filed by the respondent. The motion sought a remand on the basis that evidence obtained as a result of his arrest by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) should be suppressed in light of Oliva-Ramos v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 694 F.3d 259 (3d Cir. 2012).
 
By the motion now before the Board, the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The basis for the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is that former counsel failed to discuss with the respondent the circumstances of his arrest and failed to prepare a motion to suppress the evidence stemming from that arrest which the respondent speculates would have led to the termination of proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the motion.
 
To make out an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, an alien must show that prior counsel’s deficient performance prevented him from reasonably presenting his case and caused him “substantial prejudice.” Fadiga v. Att’y Gen., 488 F.3d 142 at 155 (3d Cir. 2007); Khan v. Att’y Gen., 448 F.3d 226, 236 (3d Cir. 2006); Uspango v. Ashcroft, 289 F.3d 226, 231 (3d Cir. 2002); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003). To evaluate the merits of an ineffectiveness claim, we apply the familiar two-part-error-and-prejudice test. Fadiga, 488 F.3d at 157. First, we ask whether “competent counsel would have acted otherwise.” Id. (quoting Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 129 (2nd Cir. 2000)). If so, we ask whether counsel’s poor performance prejudiced the alien. Id. To prove prejudice, an alien must show that there is a “reasonable likelihood” that the result of the removal proceedings would have been different had the error(s) not occurred. Id. at 159. This standard “properly requires the alien to show not just that he received ineffective assistance in his removal proceedings, but that the challenged order of removal is fundamentally unfair because there is a significant likelihood that the IJ would not have entered an order of removal absent counsel’s errors.” Id.
 
*2 In addition to these substantive requirements, the Board has three procedural requirements for motions to reopen based on ineffectiveness claims as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988): (1) the motion must be supported by an affidavit detailing counsel’s failings; (2) counsel must be informed of the allegations; and (3) the motion must show that disciplinary charges have been filed with the appropriate authority, or if not, adequately explain why not. In this case, the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. At issue, then, is whether or not the respondent suffered the requisite prejudice.
 
It is the position of the respondent that prior counsel was ineffective insofar as he did not discuss the circumstances of his arrest with the respondent and that he failed to submit a motion to suppress to disallow reliance upon information that was gleaned from what the respondent has characterized as an unlawful and racially motivated arrest. The respondent contends that had a motion to suppress been submitted, his removal proceedings would have been terminated upon the granting of the motion. However, it is to be noted that the respondent was found removable based upon pleadings rather than the information contained in the product of his arrest, the Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien (Form I-213). (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 71). While we agree that counsel may have been ineffective in not submitting a motion to suppress, as the Immigration Judge afforded him the opportunity to do so, the respondent has failed to establish “substantial prejudice.” The respondent conceded removability, has not since claimed lawful presence in the United States, and has not submitted an application for relief. As the respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for any relief, the alleged ineffective assistance has not been shown to have potentially affected the outcome of the respondent’s case. Thus, the respondent has not established a basis to remand his case on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Luke H. Abrusley, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lorraine L. Griffin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated May 20, 2015, denying his request for voluntary departure under the provisions of section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), as a matter of discretion and ordering his removal from the United States.1 The respondent’s appeal, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security, will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent’s arguments on appeal do not persuade this Board that he has demonstrated that he merits the privilege of voluntary departure as matter of discretion. See section 240(c)(4)(A)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d); Matter of Arguelles-Campos, 22 I&N Dec. 811, 820 (BIA 1999); Matter of Gamboa, 14 I&N Dec. 244 (BIA 1972). Even though the record does not contain formal conviction documents, the respondent, through counsel, has conceded that has he has been convicted of driving under the influence on two occasions (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 7; Exh. 2). See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (holding that, absent a showing of egregious circumstances, an attorney’s concessions are binding upon an alien as an admission). There can be little dispute that drunk driving is an extremely serious offense. See, e.g., United States v. Chapa-Garza, 262 F.3d 479, 485 (5th Cir. 2001). The respondent also has other convictions, and was previously granted a voluntary return after apprehension (Exh. 2). The respondent has not meaningfully articulated any positive factors, i.e., family ties to the United States or a history of gainful employment, which would warrant a holding that, despite his history of drunk driving, he warrants voluntary departure as a matter of discretion. Thus, upon a balancing of the appropriate factors, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s request for voluntary departure as a matter of discretion (I.J. at 2).
 
*2 Finally, there is an absence of indicia that the respondent’s former counsel attempted to him to call him to testify regarding his positive equities or present evidence of positive equities. The respondent has not complied with the evidentiary standards for bringing forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Moreover, the respondent has not articulated the testimony or evidence that he would have presented in these proceedings. Thus, he has not established that he was prejudiced by his former attorney’s handling of this case. See Anwar v. INS, 116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir. 1997). As such, we decline to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the respondent’s request for voluntary departure. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
For the reasons set forth above, we decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to order the respondent’s removal from the United States to Guatemala. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent, through counsel, has conceded that is subject to removal from the United States because he is an alien who is present in this country without being admitted or paroled by an immigration officer or who arrived at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 4; Exh. 1). See section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph Mbacho, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
O. El-Bogdadi
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s August 14, 2014, decision that denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. We find no reason to disturb the decision of the Immigration Judge. In this case, the record reflects that the respondent was personally served with a Notice to Appear (NTA) (Exh. 1). On April 8, 2014, the San Diego Immigration Court personally served a hearing notice on the respondent’s attorney of record, Russell Bolin, rescheduling the respondent’s hearing for June 20, 2014. The respondent failed to appear for his hearing as scheduled and he was ordered removed in absentia.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent received proper notice inasmuch as written notice of his hearing was provided to his attorney of record. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (finding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (providing that whenever a person is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to the attorney or representative of record, or to the person himself if unrepresented). Moreover, the record contains a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28) for Mr. Bolin, as required by regulation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.4(a).
 
To the extent that the respondent argues exceptional circumstances because his prior attorney did not. inform him about the date and time of his hearing, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not satisfy any of the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”). We also decline to reopen proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). Moreover, we are not persuaded by counsel for the respondent’s argument that the respondent’s failure to appear was due to a clerical error in his office. As the Immigration Judge observed, Attorney Mbacho had not entered his appearance in this matter prior to the April 8, 2014, hearing and there is no indication in the record that Attorney Mbacho entered his appearance by filling a form EOIR-28 with the Immigration Judge prior to the in absentia order. We therefore decline to further address this issue.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Catherine Susan Willmore, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ryan A. Kahler
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)] - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i)
 
Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)] - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of South Korea, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s June 24, 2014, decision, which denied the respondent’s request for a continuance. The respondent was granted the privilege of voluntary departure. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent’s removability is not disputed. Indeed, the record confirms that the respondent, through his attorney, conceded his removability under both sections 237(a)(1)(A) and 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(1)(A) and 1227(a)(1)(C)(i) as charged in the Notice to Appear (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 28; Exh. 1). However, we do acknowledge the respondent’s statement in the Notice of Appeal apparently challenging the charge under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act. In this regard, we have held that, absent egregious circumstances, a tactical decision by an attorney (in this case admitting to the allegations and conceding to the corresponding charges lodged in the Notice to Appear) is binding on the client. See Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938, 942 (BIA 1995); Matter of Valasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986). The respondent has not alleged any egregious circumstances; nor do we find any such circumstances on this record. Indeed, the respondent has not alleged that his attorney was ineffective or complied with the procedural requirements, as set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Regardless, the respondent does not dispute on appeal his removability under section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
The remaining issue raised on appeal by the respondent is whether the Immigration Judge should have continued the removal proceedings for him to further pursue an administrative appeal of the denial of his U-visa application (Form I-918) by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”). However, the respondent has failed to specify any legal or factual error in the Immigration Judge’s decision, and we are satisfied that the Immigration Judge applied the appropriate factors in denying the continuance. See Matter of Sanchez Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807 (BIA 2012).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Charles Spector, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brenda J. Thomas
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. She has filed a timely motion to reopen, alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the granting of the motion. The motion is denied.
 
The respondent contends that former counsel erroneously conceded her removability under section 237(a)(1)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(E)(i). The record reflects, however, that former counsel denied removability, and contested the charge (Exh. 1; I.J. at 1). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s adjustment of status was an admission and since she was admitted within 5 years of her conviction for smuggling, she was removable as charged (I.J. at 2-3).
 
The respondent now argues she is not removable because her adjustment of status was not an admission, citing to Martinez v. Mukasey, 519 F.3d 532 (5th Cir. 2008)(section 212(h) waiver applies to aliens who adjust their status after entering the United States, but not to those who enter the United States as lawful permanent residents); Matter of J-H-J-, 26 I&N Dec. 563 (BIA 2015). However, Martinez did not hold that adjustment of status was not an admission. Further, we have consistently held that adjustment of status is considered an admission. See e.g. Matter of Bouchra Agour, 26 I&N Dec. 566, 573 (BIA 2015). Accordingly, we do not find that former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel to the respondent such that proceedings should be reopened and termination. Nor has the respondent shown the requisite prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pablo Fernandez-Herrera, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 7, 2014, denying his motion for a continuance. On appeal, the respondent also moves for a remand based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion will be denied and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but we review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals de novo. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
We find that the Immigration Judge acted properly in concluding the proceedings and entering an order of removal. The pursuit of deferred action before the Department of Homeland Security does not constitute good cause for a continuance because the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is a matter over which the Immigration Court has no jurisdiction and the possibility that the respondent would be granted such relief was speculative. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987) (the decision to grant or deny a continuance for good cause is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge and will not be overturned on appeal unless it is shown that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing); Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348 (BIA 1982) (Immigration Judge did not err in declining to adjourn hearing to allow alien to pursue deferred action); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6.
 
We find no merit in the respondent’s argument that the decision below requires reversal because the Immigration Judge made prejudicial remarks concerning his potential eligibility for deferred action. Under the circumstances, we find that the Immigration Judge merely gave a fair summary of the posture of the respondent’s potential application for deferred action. In any event, the respondent must demonstrate substantial prejudice affecting the outcome of the proceedings to establish a due process violation warranting reversal of the Immigration Judge’s decision. See Miller v. Mukasey, 539 F.3d 159, 164 (2d Cir. 2008). We are not persuaded that the respondent has done so. Absent a showing of good cause or readily available relief, the Immigration Judge acted properly in ordering the respondent’s removal. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505 (BIA 1980) (citations omitted) (once removal proceedings are instituted, an Immigration Judge must order an alien deported if the evidence supports the charge). There is no merit in the respondent’s assertion that the Immigration Judge’s order of removal deprived him of the opportunity to persuade DHS counsel that he was a suitable candidate for deferred action on his removal since nothing prevents him from applying to the DHS to favorably exercise its prosecutorial discretion even after an order of removal is entered.
 
*2 We will deny the respondent’s motion to remand based upon ineffective assistance. As an initial matter, the claim fails because the respondent has not complied with any of the procedural requirements outlined in the Board’s decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The claim also fails because the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by the actions or inaction of prior counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (an alien asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate prejudice). The substance of the respondent’s claim is that prior counsel failed to make a persuasive case for deferred action on his removal (Brief at 8). However, an application for deferred action is a collateral matter involving the DHS’ independent exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and outside the jurisdiction of the Immigration Court. Therefore, any deficiencies in representation concerning that application are insufficient to demonstrate ineffective assistance in the proceedings before the Immigration Court.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied and the appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Candice Kasperson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Nicaragua, has appealed the May 20, 2014, decision of the Immigration Judge denying a motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
As an initial matter, we note that the respondent has not submitted a brief in support of this appeal, despite indicating on his Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) that he intends to file a separate brief or statement. Hence, we will consider the limited statements contained on the. respondent’s Notice of Appeal.
 
The arguments contained on the respondent’s Notice of Appeal do not specifically challenge the Immigration Judge’s reasons for denying the motion to reopen. The respondent simply states: “The Immigration Judge erred in applying the facts and case law. The IJ did not address the merits of the motion to re-open. The IJ abused her discretion and did not meaningfully address the motion and reasons why Respondent did not seek relief earlier.” Inasmuch as the respondent has not specifically challenged the bases for the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen, we find that the respondent’s arguments on appeal do not establish error in the Immigration Judge’s decision. See, e.g., Matter of Cervantes, 22 I&N Dec. 560, 561 n.1 (BIA 1999) (expressly declining to address an issue not raised by party on appeal); Matter of Gutierrez, 19 I&N Dec. 562, 565 n.3 (BIA 1988) (same).1
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stephen A. Lagana, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals the Immigration Judge’s February 19, 2015, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. We review the Immigration Judge’s factual findings for clear error and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The respondent’s appeal fee waiver request is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent based his motion to reopen on an apparent contention that his prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance because he only communicated with the respondent through his girlfriend when the respondent was detained. See Respondent’s Brief at 3. On appeal, the respondent argues that, inter alia, the Immigration Judge erred by finding that the motion to reopen was not timely filed. See Respondent’s Brief at 3-4. As the Immigration Judge alternatively found, however, even if the motion had been timely, the respondent did not satisfy the requirements for reopening (I.J. at 4, 5).
 
“A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). In addition, to obtain reopening, the respondent must make a prima facie showing that he is statutorily eligible for the relief sought and that he warrants relief in the exercise of discretion. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 106 (1988). Prima facie eligibility is shown where the evidence reveals a reasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied and that there is a reasonable likelihood that relief will be granted in the exercise of discretion. See Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 419 (BIA 1996).
 
In this case, the respondent requested that his proceedings be reopened but he did not submit an application for relief or supporting documentation. See Motion to Reopen; see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3) (motion to reopen to apply for relief must include the application for relief and supporting evidence). In his motion, the respondent stated only that he “was denied the opportunity to apply for political asylum.” Motion to Reopen at 3. He did not submit an asylum application or present material evidence that was unavailable at the former hearing. Therefore, because the respondent has not submitted an application or demonstrated prima facie eligibility for relief, he has not met the requirements for reopening.
 
*2 The respondent also argues that, when he waived his right to appeal on April 16, 2014, his waiver was not knowing and voluntary (Tr. at 8-10). See Respondent’s Brief at 5-6. The respondent did not raise this argument in his motion, however. See Motion to Reopen; Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 261 n.1 (BIA 2007) (matters not raised before the Immigration Judge are waived on appeal); see also Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629, 638 (BIA 2003); Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191, 196-97 n.4 (BIA 1990). Also, although the respondent argues that, because he waived his right to appeal, he lost his opportunity to apply for asylum, he again has not submitted an asylum application or demonstrated prima facie eligibility for asylum. Therefore, he has not shown that he was prejudiced by the error he alleges. See Toribio-Chavez v. Holder, 611 F.3d 57, 66 (1st Cir. 2010) (due process claim cannot succeed without a showing of prejudice).1
 
Further, as the Immigration Judge found, the respondent did not comply with at least some of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (to succeed on a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent should submit an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts including the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken; former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed to respond; the motion should reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities; the respondent must show that he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel); see also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (I.J. at 5). Additionally, the respondent did not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
For these reasons, we uphold the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX9 240 - New York, NY

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Fitzmore Harris, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 23, 2014, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his February 11, 2010, removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a reply to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent does not dispute that the Notice to Appear (NTA)(which contained the hearing notice for the February 11, 2010, hearing) was delivered to the correct address, but states that his spouse, with whom he resides, failed to give him the notice. The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. When a hearing notice is delivered by mail but “does not reach the alien through some failure in the internal workings of the household, the alien can be charged with receiving proper notice.” Matter of M-D-, 23 I&N Dec. 540, 547 (BIA 2002); Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 189 (BIA 2001). Due process was satisfied here because the method of service was reasonably calculated to ensure that notice reached the alien. See Fuentes-Argueta v. INS, 101 F.3d 867 (2d Cir. 1996).
 
The respondent alleges that his former attorney also told him he did not have to appear for his hearing because a continuation request had been filed (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, page 3). Regarding exceptional circumstances for failing to appear, the Immigration Judge correctly found the motion to reopen was untimely (I.J. at 2). The respondent filed the motion almost four years after his in absentia order of removal became final, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), (4)(ii), and he has not established the due diligence required for equitable tolling of the filing deadline (I.J. at 2-3). See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 131 (2d Cir. 2008).
 
Moreover, the respondent failed to substantially comply with the procedural requirements for bringing an ineffective assistance claim (I.J. at 3). The requirements include submitting (1) an affidavit describing in detail the agreement with counsel, (2) proof that counsel was informed of the allegations and had an opportunity to respond, and (3) a statement regarding whether a complaint was filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and, if not, why not. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). See also Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that an “alien who has failed to comply substantially with the Lozada requirements ... forfeits her ineffective assistance of counsel claim.”). Here, the respondent did not submit any evidence that he informed counsel of the allegations against him and provide him with an opportunity to respond to the allegations.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent also argues that reopening was denied in error because he has new relief insofar as his U.S. citizen spouse has filed a visa petition on his behalf. Even if the respondent had not been given oral notice in his native language, in order to pursue an application for new relief, the respondent must comply with the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3). Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). Under these standards, the respondent’s May 21, 2014, motion to reopen is untimely, inasmuch as it was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s February 11, 2010, decision, and he has not alleged that the motion would fall within any statutory or regulatory exception to the time limits. Hence, the respondent is also precluded from having his motion considered under the general time limitations for a motion to reopen.
 
The respondent has failed to establish that reopening is warranted pursuant to sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The respondent’s motion does not establish an “exceptional” situation sufficient to warrant reopening of his removal proceedings (I.J. at 3). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mark J. Devine, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Scott D. Criss
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 8, 2014, denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reconsider. The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge did not consider the request for nunc pro tunc relief discussed in his motion to reopen. The respondent explains that the evidence relating to ineffective assistance of counsel was included in the motion to reopen to provide factual support for the equitable remedy he seeks.
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge issued a decision on January 16, 2014, granting the respondent pre-conclusion voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). The respondent filed a motion to reopen on March 21, 2014, seeking reopening on the basis of a nunc pro tunc equitable remedy. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, noting that the respondent was represented by counsel during his removal proceedings, and the respondent never expressed a fear of returning to El Salvador before the court. The Immigration Judge found that absent egregious circumstances, which are not present in this case, the respondent is bound by the tactical decisions and actions made by his attorney when such attorney is acting in her professional capacity. Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938 (BIA 1995). See I.J. Dec. dated March 24, 2014.
 
The respondent claims that he was denied the opportunity to file an application for protection under the Convention Against Torture. However, the respondent was represented by counsel when he accepted a pre-conclusion voluntary departure order, and he waived appeal. On appeal and in his motion to reopen, the respondent suggests that his former counsel may have provided ineffective assistance, but he has not complied with any of the requirements discussed in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Moreover, the respondent did not establish any prejudice as a result of his prior attorney’s representation which would warrant reopening as an equitable remedy. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 561-62 (BIA 2003) (requiring prejudice stemming from prior counsel’s actions in addition to compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra). The purpose of establishing ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Lozada would be rendered superfluous if the proceedings were reopened on the basis of a nunc pro tunc equitable remedy under the circumstances present in this case.1 The respondent did not file an application or other documents which establish a prima facie case for protection under the Convention Against Torture. The Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider as he did not identify any factual or legal errors in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2).
 
*2 We further find no basis for exercising our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings in this case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose Zamudio Marin, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(B)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(B)(i)(I)] - Nonimmigrant - no valid passport
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated March 09, 2015. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s February 17, 2015, motion to reopen the proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on December 3, 2014, pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A) (I.J. at 1-3). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5). We write separately to supplement the Immigration Judge’s decision with a few additional points, in light of the respondent’s appeal. First, the respondent acknowledges that she had actual notice for the December 3, 2014, hearing (I.J. at 2; Respondent’s Br. at 9). Second, the respondent claims in her declaration that she relied on the advice of a lawyer, whom she characterized as “my lawyer” (Respondent’s M.T.R. at Tab C), not to appear for the December 3, 2014, hearing. She claims that the lawyer advised her “agent,” who then advised her, that the December 3, 2014, hearing would be “nullified” as a result of her release from custody on November 25, 2014 (Respondent’s M.T.R. at Tab C).
 
The lawyer tells a different story, however. According to the lawyer’s declaration, he was not retained to represent the respondent at the time the respondent’s agent contacted him about the December 3, 2014, hearing (Respondent’s M.T.R. at Tab E). Rather, the lawyer’s declaration reflects that he was only retained to represent the respondent in connection with her credible fear interview on October 31, 2014 (Respondent’s M.T.R. at Tab E). This statement, we note, is corroborated by the fact that the lawyer did not enter an appearance on the respondent’s behalf at the November 24, 2014, master calendar hearing (Respondent’s M.T.R. at Tabs C, E).
 
While we have recognized that a lawyer’s affirmative direction not to appear for a scheduled hearing can constitute exceptional circumstances justifying the rescission of an in absentia removal order, such a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must comply with the requirements delineated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
*2 In this case, the respondent has not set forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with her former counsel, and in fact, the record shows that representation in these proceedings was not within the scope of the attorney-client agreement. Nor has a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities against the respondent’s former counsel; the respondent, in fact, has not even acknowledged the existence of this requirement (Respondent’s M.T.R. at 2-3). See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir. 2000) (recognizing that Lozada’s “requirement regarding disciplinary allegations served both to deter meritless claims and to aid in policing the immigration bar” (citing Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639)).
 
Insofar as the respondent has not established a viable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, she has not established exceptional circumstances warranting rescission of the in absentia removal order. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX9 852 - Atlanta, GA
June 24, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Grace R. Kennedy, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider the Board’s March 26, 2015, decision, in which we denied his untimely and number-barred motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
In the motion, the respondent argues that the motion to reopen time period should be equitably tolled in his case, and that he exercised due diligence since the Board’s December 16, 2013, decision dismissing his appeal until he filed his motion to reopen on December 17, 2014. See Ruiz-Turcios v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 717 F.3d 847, 851 (11th Cir. 2013) (stating that equitable tolling generally requires a litigant to show “(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way”) (citing Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408 (2005)). However, the respondent’s prior motion did not argue that the motion to reopen time period should be equitably tolled, or that the respondent has exercised diligence since the Board’s December 16, 2013, decision. A motion to reconsider based on arguments that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 58 (BIA 2006). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider will be denied.1
 
To the extent the respondent now seeks to present the equitable tolling argument and has presented new documents, his motion constitutes a motion to reopen in substance. See Matter of 0-S-G-, supra, 57-58 (a motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based on the previous factual record, while a motion to reopen seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence). As a motion to reopen, the respondent’s motion is untimely and number-barred. Section 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000); Matter of L-V-K-, 22 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1999). Therefore, it will be denied as untimely and number-barred.
 
Furthermore, the arguments and evidence submitted do not show that equitable tolling of the motion time or number limitations is warranted. The respondent argues that, after he received the Board’s December 16, 2013, decision dismissing his appeal, he retained another lawyer and requested the DHS to file a joint motion to reopen, but the DHS denied this request on June 24, 2014; that he attempted to obtain an affidavit from his prior counsel, Joseph Azar, but attorney Azar merely kept promising and did not actually provide an affidavit; and that he eventually filed a bar complaint against attorney Azar on December 8, 2014, and filed his motion to reopen on December 17, 2014 (Motion, at 5-7; Motion Exh. A-C).
 
*2 The motion and the respondent’s affidavit submitted with the motion do not identify the new lawyer who represented him in June 2014, but the DHS’s June 24, 2014, letter declining to join in a motion to reopen was addressed to his current counsel, indicating that the respondent was represented by his current counsel at that time (Motion Exh. C). Therefore, the letter shows that the respondent was no longer being represented by attorney Azar but was being represented by his current counsel in June 2014.2 Nevertheless, the motion to reopen was not filed until December 2014, about 6 months later. Moreover, requesting the DHS to join in a motion to reopen does not necessarily show diligence in pursuing the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and the respondent offers no explanation why he could not file a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel while requesting the DHS’s help. Removable aliens should not delay matters by pursuing multiple avenues of relief seriatim when they could have been pursued simultaneously. See, e.g., Galvez Pineda v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 833, 839 (10th Cir. 2005).
 
The respondent also argues that his motion to reopen was further delayed because he was trying to obtain an affidavit from attorney Azar. However, the respondent does not argue that obtaining and submitting such an affidavit is one of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (see Motion, at 9). The respondent fails to explain why such an affidavit was necessary before he could file a bar complaint against the attorney or a motion to reopen based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In any event, the respondent eventually filed a bar complaint and the motion to reopen without having to obtain an affidavit from the prior attorney. Based on the above, the respondent did not show that he has been pursuing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim diligently, or that he was prevented by “some extraordinary circumstance” from filing a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See Ruiz-Turcios v. U.S. Atty. Gen., supra. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent reiterates his request for us to sua sponte reopen his proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) and to administratively close his proceedings to allow him to seek consular processing of his visa petition. We do not find that the respondent’s case presents an exceptional situation that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

In the prior decision, the Board also noted that the respondent provided radically different accounts on why he did not timely appear at his December 14, 2011, hearing, in his sworn statement submitted with his March 19, 2012, motion to reopen filed with the Immigration Judge (the “first statement”) and in his statement submitted with the December 17, 2014, motion to reopen (the “second statement”), and that he has not reconciled these divergent accounts (Dec. 17, 2014, Motion Exh. C; Mar. 19, 2012 I.J. Motion Affidavit). The respondent now asserts in his statement submitted with the current motion (the “third statement”) that the first statement was prepared by attorney Azar and he signed it without reading it or knowing its contents (Motion Exh. A, at 6-7). However, the respondent fails to explain why this explanation could not be presented with his prior motion to reopen.
In any event, the respondent’s accounts provided in his second and third statements are not supported by the record in this case. The respondent stated in his second statement that at a hearing on September 13, 2011, the Immigration Judge gave his attorney the notice of the December 14, 2011, hearing (Dec. 17, 2014, Motion Exh. C, at 5). In his third statement, the respondent states that the Immigration Judge was not present at the September 13, 2011, hearing and the clerk of the Immigration Court gave his attorney the notice of hearing (Motion Exh. A, at 5). However, as noted by the Immigration Judge, the notice of hearing was issued to the respondent personally, not to the attorney (I.J. May 22, 2012, Dec. at 1). Thus, the respondent fails to explain why he would rely on an unnamed “assistant” at attorney Azar’s office for the hearing date and time.
The respondent asserts that “we” (i.e., he and attorney Azar) went to about 3 Immigration Court hearings and the attorney’s unnamed “assistant” would call him the day before the hearing, and that this was their “normal procedure”; thus he suggests that it would have been reasonable for him to rely on the “““assistant” (Motion Exh. A, at 5-6; Dec. 17, 2014, Motion Exh. C, at 5). However, the record shows that the respondent was presented by a different attorney, not attorney Azar, at his prior hearings, and the notices of hearing were issued to the other attorney.

The respondent’s motion does not explain exactly when the respondent retained his current counsel. Although the respondent’s affidavit states that, after the Board’s decision dismissing his appeal, “[w]e found a lawyer right before the deadline for the appeal” (Motion Exh. A, at 7, ¶ 25), but the meaning of this phrase is not clear.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul A. Esquivel, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 10, 2014, denying his motion to reopen to apply for asylum under section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1158, withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16. The appeal will be dismissed.1
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003(d)(3).
 
The record reflects that the respondent was granted post-conclusion voluntary departure on May 7, 2013, to depart on or before September 4, 2013. On December 16, 2013, the respondent filed a motion to reopen to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, finding that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel and he did not establish prima facie eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or for protection under the Convention Against Torture (I.J. at 2).
 
On appeal, counsel for the respondent states that he has attempted to obtain the necessary information from the respondent’s two previous attorneys to determine whether he can proceed with a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, but he has not been provided the file from either of the attorneys. The respondent indicates that he is attempting to compile the necessary evidence for a viable non-frivolous complaint, and that he will submit supplements, including a completed complaint with the proper agencies upon accumulation of evidence. To date, the respondent has not submitted any additional evidence in support of his claim that he would be pursuing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and he has not complied with the procedural requirements pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). The respondent has not submitted evidence that he has notified his former attorney of his ineffective assistance allegations; and there is no evidence that a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authority. Matter of Lozada, supra. Consequently, the respondent has not established that reopening is warranted on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent seeks reopening due to his fear of returning to Mexico, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established changed circumstances or changed country conditions to warrant reopening of proceedings. The respondent was represented by counsel when he requested and was granted voluntary departure, after being fully advised of the consequences if he failed to depart. The alleged failure of former counsel to inform the respondent of the availability of asylum, withholding of removal, and of protection under the Convention Against Torture does not create “changed country conditions” or “previously unavailable evidence” when the basis for the asylum claim arose before the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 7, 2013. The respondent’s fear of harm could have been presented at his previous hearing. There also has been no prima facie showing that upon return to Mexico the respondent would face torture by or with the consent or acquiescence of government officials (to include the concept of willful blindness) for the purposes of the CAT. In light of the foregoing, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established that reopening is warranted to consider his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c)(2), 1208.18(a)(1). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Despite the respondent’s claim that he has been unable to obtain an audio recording of his underlying removal proceedings, we decline to order a transcript of these proceedings to be prepared or further extend the briefing schedule in this matter. A transcript is not ordinarily prepared where a motion to reopen is filed, since the motion will be decided on the basis of its merits rather than on the basis of a review of the record. See Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996) (noting transcript ordinarily not present when motion to reopen filed).

IN RE: MANDEEP SINGH
File: AXXX XX6 739 - Harlingen, TX
June 12, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eileen Collins Bretz, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On November 8, 2011, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal in absentia, and on January 17, 2012, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(4)(ii), 1003.26. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision on May 9, 2013. This case was last before the Board on July 26, 2013, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our decision. The respondent has now filed another motion to reopen the removal proceedings to rescind the in absentia order of removal to enable him to apply for asylum and withholding of removal. The motion will be denied.
 
It is undisputed that the respondent failed to appear at his scheduled removal hearing. The respondent, however, now raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Norma Sepulveda, Esquire, who represented him before the Immigration Judge. He also raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Laura Perez, Esquire, who filed his motion to reopen and rescind with the Immigration Judge, and his appeal and motion to reconsider with the Board, for failing to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Attorney Sepulveda.
 
The respondent has attempted to comply with the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the Board. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). He has not, however, shown that prior counsel rendered deficient performance resulting in prejudice. Id. See also Miranda-Lores v. I.N.S., 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994) (“To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at a deportation proceeding, an alien must show (1) ineffective representation and (2) substantial prejudice, which occurred as a result of the ineffective representation”); Ogbemudia v. I.N.S., 988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir. 1993).
 
The respondent alleges that Attorney Sepulveda did not properly inform him of the consequences of the failure to appear, and did not provide him with notice of the removal hearing. The Notice to Appear, however, reveals that on June 15, 2011, the respondent was provided oral notice in the Punjabi language of the consequences of the failure to appear. See Exhibit 1. The record further reveals that notice of the November 8, 2011, hearing, was properly served on the respondent’s counsel, Attorney Sepulveda, who in response to the allegations against her, claims that she attempted to contact the respondent to no avail at his address of record, i.e., the address provided by his bond obligor. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (recognizing that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5 (notice of hearing sent to an alien’s attorney of record is sufficient notice). Indeed, the respondent states in the instant motion that “[a]lthough (he) had contact with his bond obligor, his bond obligor did not notify him of his hearing until he received notice from ICE requesting that he deliver (the respondent) at a set time and date.” See Respondent’s Motion at 5. Given this record, it has not been shown that the respondent’s failure to appear at his removal hearing was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of Attorney Sepulveda. As the respondent has not shown ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of Attorney Sepulveda, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against Attorney Perez lacks merit and will not be considered further.
 
*2 In sum, we are not persuaded to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order based on the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Further, as previously found, the respondent has not shown that his failure to appear at the November 8, 2011, removal hearing was the result of “exceptional circumstances” as defined at section 240(e)(1) of the Act. We also are not persuaded to reopen these proceedings to enable the respondent to apply for asylum and related relief as he has not set forth a claim of materially changed circumstances or conditions in his native country, India. See Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Finally, the respondent has not set forth a case of exceptional circumstances warranting reopening in the exercise of our sua sponte authority. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

File: AXXX XX8 905 - New York, NY

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brenna Torres, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s June 9, 2014, decision that denied his motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The record before us does not contain a brief from the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that he did not receive proper notice for the October 6, 2000, hearing. We affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge.1 The respondent does not submit a sworn affidavit or an unsworn declaration under penalty of perjury, or satisfactorily explain why not. Leaving aside the “false name” issue, the respondent was obligated to provide to the Immigration Court an address at which he may be contacted regarding removal proceedings, and also promptly provide any change of address (Notice to Appear (Form I-862)). See sections 239(a)(1) and (2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229(a)(1) and (2). The respondent’s 2000 Federal income tax return (Motion Exh. G, at 73-75) was filed listing a Southampton, New York, address, and the W-2 lists an East Hampton, New York, address. He does not provide any evidence to show that he was living at the New York, New York, address [provided in his motion to change venue and provided for the Notice to EOIR: Alien Address (Form I-830)] during June of 2000 when the notice of hearing was sent.
 
To the extent that the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of former counsel (Gary Ortega), he does not satisfy any of the three requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) to properly make a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent requested reopening and administrative closure of his case. We look to the factors discussed in Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012). The reasons administrative closure is sought are not persuasive. The respondent can apply to the DHS for prosecutorial discretion without these proceedings being administratively closed, and voluntary departure is not a new form of relief. The DHS opposed the motion to reopen on the merits. Even if the respondent pursues prosecutorial discretion, he has not shown a likelihood of success. The delay from October of 2000 until March of 2014 is due to the respondent. He does not show that there would be a different ultimate outcome when the case is recalendared before the Immigration Judge or the appeal is reinstated before the Board. The factors in Matter of Avetisyan, supra, weigh against administrative closure.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We do not affirm one portion of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The DHS alleged in its opposition that the respondent had one arrest, and the Immigration Judge observed in his decision that the respondent did not respond to the allegation. However, the DHS did not submit any evidence of the arrest, and he now submits a certificate of disposition [which does not warrant a remand] which shows that the criminal record was sealed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ramiro Alcazar, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; termination of proceedings
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 10, 2014. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and ordered him removed. The respondent challenges denial of a continuance and challenges removability on appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was placed in proceedings on April 5, 2012. His first hearing was on May 14, 2012. He was granted a continuance to find an attorney (Tr. at 13). His second hearing was on September 10, 2012. He was granted a continuance for attorney preparation (Tr. at 15). On December 3, 2012, the respondent (through counsel) said he is not “Rafael Martinez,” denied all the factual allegations in the Notice to Appear (NTA), denied the charges of removability, and indicated that he intended to file a motion to suppress evidence and terminate proceedings. The Immigration Judge granted him a continuance to file that motion (Tr. at 19-21; Exhs. 2, 4-5).
 
On February 14, 2013, the respondent (through counsel) withdrew the motion to suppress evidence and terminate proceedings and withdrew his objection to consideration of the Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien (Form I-213), excepting the name of the respondent (Tr. at 48-50, 58-60, 63-66, 80, 94; I.J. at 2-3). On March 7, 2013, after the NTA was amended to add the respondent’s true name, the respondent admitted proper service of the NTA, admitted the factual allegations, conceded removability, designated Mexico for removal, and requested voluntary departure (Tr. at 58-60, 63-66; Exh. 6; I.J. at 2-3). The respondent was then granted continuances to pursue Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and prosecutorial discretion (Tr. at 67-69; I.J. at 2; Exhs. 7-8). On March 10, 2014, the respondent indicated that DACA and prosecutorial discretion had been denied (Tr. at 73-74, 79, 92, 96-97; I.J. at 2).
 
The respondent (through counsel) then indicated that he was not seeking voluntary departure or other relief, indicated that he was amending the pleadings again to deny that proper service of the NTA was made and to deny the charges of removability, and he requested another continuance (Tr. at 97-98, 100-101; I.J. at 2-3). The Immigration Judge denied that request (I.J. at 3). The Immigration Judge found removability proved, regardless of the pleadings, based on the Form I-213 (Exh. 3) and ordered the respondent removed (I.J. at 3-4).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent1 challenges denial of the continuance. An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009). We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We agree that the respondent did not show good cause for another continuance.
 
Also on appeal, the respondent disputes removability. The respondent attempts to raise on appeal the issues raised in the motion to suppress evidence and terminate proceedings that he voluntarily withdrew before the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 48-50, 58-60, 63-66, 80, 94; I.J. at 2-3). The respondent argues that, despite the withdrawal of the motion, despite his withdrawal of objection to the Form I-213, despite his admission of the factual allegations and despite his concession of removability, he is not, in fact, removable. We find, however, that the prior withdrawal of the motion, withdrawal of objection to the Form I-213, admissions of fact, and concessions of removability are binding on the respondent. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal concession made by counsel is binding on the alien). Cf. Hoodho v. Holder, 558 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir. 2009) (holding that facts admitted by a party are “judicial admissions” that bind that party throughout the litigation). Moreover, we note that the respondent does not assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Charles H. Kuck, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sirce E. Owen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on March 12, 2015, when we denied the respondent’s untimely and number-barred motion to reopen. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider our decision denying his motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion does not convince us that reconsideration of our previous decision is warranted. A party seeking reconsideration requests that the original decision be reexamined in light of alleged legal or factual errors, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). Here, the respondent largely raises the same or similar arguments in the motion to reconsider as were raised in his prior motion to reopen. We considered those arguments and found them unpersuasive when viewed within the record as a whole before we determined that the respondent had not established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and denied his motion to reopen. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 58 (stating that “a motion to reconsider is not a process by which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief presented on appeal...”). Disagreement with the result is not sufficient.
 
To the extent that the respondent is attempting to raise new arguments related to his compliance with the requirements laid out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec, 637 (BIA 1988), these arguments are not properly raised for the first time in a motion to reconsider. See O-S-G-, supra, at 58 (stating that “[a] motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied” and “arguments for consideration on appeal should all be submitted at one time, rather than in piecemeal fashion.”) (citation omitted). A motion to reconsider is neither a vehicle for advancing supplemental legal arguments that could have been previously raised nor a mechanism for submitting a late-filed brief. Moreove, the respondent did not file his bar complaint until after the Board issued its March 12, 2015, decision, finding that the respondent did not substantially comply with Matter of Lozada, supra. Regardless, none of the arguments or evidence presented, including the response from the respondent’s prior counsel, Mr. Fogel, convinces us of error in our ultimate determination that the respondent has not established prejudice by any actions or inactions of his former counsel (Motion at Tab I). Therefore, the motion to reconsider will be denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Royal F. Berg, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anastasie M. Senat
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s April 7, 2014, denial of his motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed. The respondent’s requests for oral argument, and en banc or 3-member panel review, are denied.
 
The Board reviews Immigration Judges’ findings of fact, including credibility determinations, for clear error, and we review all other matters on appeal de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
“A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). Here, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as the respondent did not satisfy the requirements of reopening. See Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
There is no question that the evidence was previously available. The respondent could have presented the evidence at the former hearing, but did not do so because he expressed no concerns about returning to Guatemala. Since the respondent did not comply with the requirements of reopening, the Immigration Judge properly denied the motion.
 
In addition, as noted by the Immigration Judge, the DHS considered the respondent’s request for prosecutorial discretion and denied the request. Neither the Immigration Judge, nor this Board, has authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion in the respondent’s case. See Matter of G-N-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 281, 284 (BIA 1998). A request for prosecutorial discretion is a collateral matter, and the Immigration Judge did not need to continue the proceedings to allow the respondent to make such a request to the DHS. See generally Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348 (BIA 1982) (explaining that prosecutorial discretion is a function of the DHS; and that it was not error for the Immigration Judge to decline to continue the hearing for the alien to apply for a form of prosecutorial discretion for his or her case). Moreover, the respondent has not shown he was prejudiced by the continuance denial, as he has not shown he has been granted prosecutorial discretion by DHS; nor has he shown that he is eligible for any forms of relief from removal. See Bathula v. Holder, 723 F.3d 889, 903 n. 34 (7th Cir. 2013); Rapheal v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 521, 533 (7th Cir. 2008).
 
*2 The respondent contends that his due process rights were violated because, inter alia, he may not have been adequately advised regarding his avenues of relief. We disagree. In order to establish a denial of the right to due process, the respondent must show that he was prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s actions. See Hasanaj v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 780, 785 (7th Cir. 2004); Wigglesworth v. INS, 319 F.3d 951, 960 (7th Cir. 2003). Here, the respondent was represented by counsel at his last two hearings and a Spanish interpreter was provided at all hearings. The motion was properly denied because while the respondent provided his statement and his Form I-589 application, the respondent did not establish that the alleged facts were new and previously unavailable. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3).
 
We also find without merit the respondent’s contention that he should have been able to withdraw pleadings. See generally Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (a respondent is bound by the tactical decisions made by his counsel). The respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel; nor has he complied with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent requests a transcription of the proceedings. The request is denied. Normally, a transcription of the hearing is not ordered from the appeal of a denial of a motion to reopen. If a review of the record indicates that transcription is important to adjudicate the appeal, the transcript will be ordered. Here, we are not persuaded that a transcript is necessary to resolve this appeal, because the digital audio recording of the hearing is available. Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: WAYNE LEWIS
File: AXXX XX9 875 - New York, NY
June 3, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Audrey A. Thomas, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s September 9, 2014, decision which denied his motion to rescind his in absentia removal order. The appeal will be dismissed.1
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues involving questions of law, judgment and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of her own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). In determining whether exceptional circumstances exist to excuse an alien’s failure to appear, the “totality of circumstances” pertaining to the alien’s case must be considered. Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, 509 (BIA 1996).
 
The respondent received personal service of the Notice to Appear on October 28, 2008 (Exh. 1). On November 6, 2008, the respondent appeared, conceded removability as charged in the Notice to Appear, and indicated his intention to apply for adjustment of status. On September 23, 2009, he failed to appear and was ordered removed in absentia. On November 2, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, which was granted. On September 15, 2010, he appeared with counsel who requested a continuance which was granted, and the matter was reset until September 29, 2010. He failed to appear on September 29, 2010, reportedly because he experienced a panic attack after seeing immigration officers and departed the building. The Immigration Judge adjourned the matter until October 1, 2010.
 
*2 Following a hearing conducted in absentia on October 1, 2010, at which the respondent failed to appear and the Department of Homeland Security (DBS) presented evidence, an Immigration Judge found him subject to removal as charged in the Notice to Appear, and ordered him removed from the United States.2 See generally section 240 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. His counsel appeared and indicated that she did not know the respondent’s location. She requested to withdraw as counsel in February 2011.
 
On April 29, 2014, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a motion to rescind his in absentia removal order. He alleged that he did not appear on October 1, 2010, because his attorney did not inform him of the October 1, 2010, hearing date, that he was experiencing financial difficulties, and essentially was homeless at the time. The respondent indicated that he did not attempt to contact his previous attorney because he owed her legal fees and believed that she would not speak to him.
 
The DHS filed a response in opposition to the motion to reopen, noting that the motion failed to address why the respondent did not appear on September 29, 2010, and did not offer any medical evidence to excuse his failure to appear. In addition, the DHS observed that notice to the respondent’s attorney for the hearings on September 29, and October 1, 2010, constituted effective notice to him, and that he had not filed an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his prior attorney.
 
On September 9, 2014, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to rescind the in absentia removal order because the respondent had failed to explain why he did not appear on September 29, 2010. She noted that his prior counsel had informed her on September 29, 2010, that the respondent did not appear because he had a panic attack after seeing immigration officers at the Immigration Court and had visited an emergency clinic. However, the respondent had not submitted any medical evidence to support this contention with his motion to reopen (I.J. at 3). In addition, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and had failed to establish due diligence by waiting almost 4 years to file a motion to reopen with any explanation for the delay (Id.). Finally, the Immigration Judge determined that notice to the respondent’s counsel for the October 1, 2010, hearing constituted effective notice to him, and that he had not established exceptional circumstances to excuse his failure to appear (I.J. at 4).
 
The respondent submitted a Notice of Appeal which contained a short statement of reasons which alleged without elaboration that the Immigration Judge erred in her decision. His brief claimed that he was sick on September 29, 2010, and was vomiting, dizzy and had diarrhea. However, the brief does not address why he did not appear on October 1, 2010, and it does not reiterate the contention made in the motion to reopen that he failed to appear because his attorney did not inform him of the hearing date. Although he filed a brief, he requested and received an extension of the filing deadline to submit a supplemental brief with medical evidence. His request for a second extension was denied. He has not submitted any medical evidence to date.
 
*3 The respondent does not contest that he is subject to removal as charged, and he does not allege any error in the Immigration Judge’s decision that he failed to establish that his in absentia deportation order should be rescinded. In addition, his brief on appeal indicates that he did not appear because he was sick, which contradicts the claim in his motion that he did not appear because his prior attorney did not inform him of the hearing date.
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. Service of the Notice of Hearing on the alien’s representative is proper. Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (notice to alien’s counsel constitutes notice to alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). The respondent has not established that his absence at the scheduled hearing was the result of a lack of notice because his prior attorney received proper notice of the hearing. Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996) (alien seeking to reopen in absentia proceedings based upon her unsuccessful communications with attorney about hearing date did not establish exceptional circumstances where she failed to satisfy all of requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
To the extent that the respondent claimed that his prior attorney (who represents him on appeal) purportedly did not tell him he had a hearing on October 1, 2010, this allegation, without more, does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, especially in light of the respondent’s concession that he did not remain in contact with his attorney. In addition, the respondent could have contacted the Immigration Court directly. Furthermore, he has not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) to establish ineffective assistance of counsel because he has not filed a state bar complaint.
 
Moreover, for the reasons stated in the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent did not establish that his absence at the scheduled hearing was the result of exceptional circumstances, as required by section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. See section 240(e)(1) of the Act. See also Matter of B-A-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 1998) (“twisted foot” does not constitute exceptional circumstance); Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33 (BIA 1998) (strong headache did not constitute exceptional circumstance). See also Cabrera v. Gonzales, 229 Fed. Appx. 483 (9th Cir. 2007) (stomach infection, diarrhea and abdominal pain did not constitute exceptional circumstances or serious illness sufficient to merit reopening of in absentia order). To the extent that the respondent alleges that his panic attack on September 29, 2010, constituted an exceptional circumstance to excuse his failure to appear, he has not provided any medical evidence to substantiate his claim, or alleged that a panic attack on September 29, 2010, also was the reason he failed to appear on October 1, 2010. In addition, he failed to address or explain, either in his motion or on appeal, why he waited almost 4 years to file his motion to reopen.
 
*4 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent has filed a request for a stay of removal. Given our disposition in this order the stay of removal is moot.

On April 7, 2010, the DHS filed lodged charges under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), alleging that the respondent had been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct. On September 9, 2014, the Immigration Judge did not sustain this charge because the DHS had not submitted evidence of the record of conviction for one of the convictions (I.J. at 2).

IN RE: ARMANDO RAMIREZ-CASTANEDA1
File: AXXX XX9 596 - York, PA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Elizabeth M. Trinidad, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William E. Lore
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the April 25, 2013, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings.2 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requests summary affirmance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge did not consider Leslie v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 611 F.3d 171 (3d Cir. 2010), or certain defects in the Notice to Appeal. We affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judge’s findings of fact and analysis support his conclusion that the respondent did not satisfy his burden of proof as it relates to his motion to reopen (I.J. at 2-3).
 
Citing Leslie v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge committed reversible error, as there is no evidence that the Immigration Judge gave him a pro bono list of legal service providers (Resp. Br. at 5, 7-10). We disagree. The respondent does not deny that he was personally served with the Notice to Appear (“NTA”) (Form I-862) or that the NTA bears his signature. While the respondent argues that he may have been in deportation proceedings, the Immigration Judge found that “the original and only charging document in this case was a Notice to Appear, Form I-862, and dated February 17, 1998” (I.J. at 2). Further, the Immigration Judge reasonably noted that the NTA’s Certificate of Service indicates that the “respondent was provided the pro bono list” (I.J. at 2, n.2).
 
A motion to reopen may not be granted, unless the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4); Matter of Ige, 20 I&N Dec. 880, 884 (BIA 1994). The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (“Third Circuit”), in whose jurisdiction this case arises, has found that “the prima facie case standard for a motion to reopen . . . requires the applicant to produce objective evidence showing a ‘reasonable likelihood’ that he or she can establish” entitlement to relief. Guo v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 556, 563 (3d Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). Moreover, the Third Circuit has explained that “[p]rima facie scrutiny entails consideration of ‘the evidence that accompanies the motion as well as relevant evidence that may exist in the record of the prior hearing, in light of the applicable statutory requirements for relief.”DD’ Id. at 563 n.7 (citation omitted).
 
*2 The respondent has not established that these proceedings should be reopened on account of lack of proper notice. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent argues on appeal that the NTA may not have been signed by someone authorized to do so (Resp. Br. at 6, 12-13). However, as the respondent has not shown that any statute or regulation prohibits another immigration officer from signing on behalf of the issuing officer listed on the Notice to Appear, it follows that he has not shown that it constitutes a violation of a regulation. In addition, there is a presumption that public officers, including DHS employees, properly discharge their duties. See U. S. v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U.S. 1, 14-15 (1926); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27, 37 (BIA 1995) (citations omitted).
 
On this record, the respondent’s argument is insufficient to rebut the presumption of regularity. There is also no evidence that the respondent was prejudiced by the alleged defect in the Notice to Appear. The Notice to Appear included the allegations and charge against him and the alleged defect in the Notice to Appear did not prejudice the respondent because it did not interfere with his understanding of the charge against him or his ability to respond to that charge. See e.g., Kohli v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 1061 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding the Board complied with the regulations that vest jurisdiction in the Immigration Court and the alleged defect in the NTA did not deprive the Immigration Court of jurisdiction).
 
We concur with the Immigration Judge that the NTA was not defective for lacking the date, time, and place of the hearing (I.J. at 2). The respondent asserts that the NTA contravenes section 239(a)(1)(G) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1129(a)(1)(G) because the form itself does not state the date, time and place for the commencement of proceedings (Resp. Br. at 12-14). The respondent maintains that the NTA is thus defective. Contrary to the respondent’s appellate contentions, the absence of a specific date, time, and place for the initial removal hearing in the NTA does not render it “defective” (Resp. Br. at 12-14). See Matter of Camarillo, 25 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 2011). As noted in Matter of Camarillo, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.18(b) permits the NTA to include such scheduling information “where practicable.” The Immigration Judge reasonably determined that the respondent’s arguments are also undercut by the subsequent notice of hearing sent to the respondent’s counsel of record (I.J. at 2). Popa v. Holder, 571 F.3d 890 (9th Cir. 2009) (holding that a NTA that failed to include a date or time of alien’s deportation hearing but states that a date and time will be set later, is not defective as long as the notice of hearing is in fact later sent to the alien). In view of the circumstances presented, we are not persuaded by the arguments on appeal that the NTA was defective and jurisdiction was not conferred to the court.
 
*3 Finally, even if the NTA was defective, the violation of a regulation does not necessarily invalidate a removal proceeding. See Matter of Hernandez, 21 I&N Dec. 224, 226 (BIA 1996). Rather, we have held that the violation of a regulatory requirement invalidates a proceeding only where the regulation provides a benefit to the alien and the violation prejudiced the interest of the alien who was to be protected by the regulation. See Matter of Garcia-Flores, 17 I&N Dec. 325 (BIA 1996). The respondent does not contend that he is in this country pursuant to a lawful admission and is not subject to removal from the United States, nor does he allege that he is currently eligible for any form of relief from removal. Thus, he has not demonstrated that the regulation provides a benefit to him or that he was prejudiced by the individual signing the NTA.
 
The respondent moves that the proceedings be administratively closed so that he may apply for prosecutorial discretion before the DHS (Resp. Br. at 15-18). See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012) (setting forth the factors to consider in determining whether administrative closure of a proceeding is appropriate even when it is opposed by one of the parties). The exercise of prosecutorial discretion is a matter within the authority of the DHS, not of the Immigration Judge or the Board.3 See Matter of Bahta, 22 I&N Dec. 1381, 1391 (BIA 2000) (observing that the DHS has prosecutorial discretion, which includes the discretion to address the equities of individual cases in a manner that the rigid application of a broadly drawn statute often will not allow); see also Matter of G-N-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 281 (BIA 1998); Matter of Singh, 21 I&N Dec. 427, 435 (BIA 1996); Matter of Yazdani, 17 I&N Dec. 626, 630 (BIA 1981). As a general matter, the DHS is in the best position to assess its own priorities and whether its prosecutorial discretion should be exercised in a particular case. The potential exercise of discretion does not represent an “immigration benefit” over which the Immigration Court or this Board has jurisdiction or to which a respondent may claim entitlement.4 See generally, section 240 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a; 8 C.F.R. § § 1003.1(b), (d)(1)(i). The DHS has not joined in the respondent’s motion. Neither the Board nor the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction to compel the DHS to exercise prosecutorial discretion which may be granted at any stage of the proceedings. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2009) (holding that the Board lacks the authority to reopen a proceeding to allow an alien an opportunity to seek relief from removal if the Board and the Immigration Judge have no authority to grant the requested form of relief, especially where reopening is sought simply as a mechanism to stay the final order while the collateral matter is resolved by the agency or court having jurisdiction to do so).
 
*4 The Immigration Judge did not err in denying the respondent’s motion to terminate proceedings. The Immigration Judge only has the authority delegated to him or her by the Attorney General. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.10(b). It is the function of the Immigration Judge to adjudicate the case and not to determine when or whether charges are brought. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(a) and (b); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.1(a) (authority of the Immigration Judge). The initiation of removal proceedings through the issuance of a Notice to Appear is covered by section 239 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229; see 8 C.F.R. §§ 2.1, 239.2(a) issuance of Notice to Appear). The DHS, not an Immigration Judge, has prosecutorial discretion to commence proceedings. Matter of Bahta, 22 I&N Dec. 1381, 1391 (BIA 2000) (INS has unreviewable prosecutorial discretion); Matter of G-N-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 281 (BIA 1998); Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 350 (BIA 1982). Further, section 240 of the Act confers prosecutorial discretion upon the DHS to commence proceedings, and once proceedings have been commenced, it is the responsibility of the Immigration Judge to adjudicate them. See Matter of Lujan-Quintana, 25 I&N Dec. 53, 56 (BIA 2009) (“DHS has inherent flexibility, in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, to pursue removal of an alien in either expedited removal proceedings or proceedings under section 240 of the Act.”); see also Matter of Bahta, supra; Matter of G-N-C-, supra; Matter of Quintero, supra.
 
The respondent’s motion does not present “exceptional circumstances” that would warrant the exercise of our discretionary authority to reopen his proceedings sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Having considered the respondent’s appellate contentions (Resp. Br. at 15-18), reopening and administrative closure is also not warranted because we do not have the authority to grant relief from removal solely on equitable or humanitarian grounds. See Matter of Silva-Rodriguez, 20 I&N Dec. 448 (BIA 1992); Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734, 742 (BIA 1988). Under these circumstances, administrative closure of the proceedings is not warranted under Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012).
 
*5 We acknowledge that enforcement of the removal order may result in hardship to the respondent and family members. However, the Immigration Judge and the Board do not have jurisdiction to fashion equitable remedies or grant general humanitarian relief. See Matter of Medina, supra.
 
In general, motions to reopen must be filed within 90 days from the date “on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceedings sought to be reopened,” see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); see also section 240(c)(7)(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C), although this time limit is subject to equitable tolling. Alzaarir v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 639 F.3d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 2011). The respondent does not dispute that his motion to reopen was filed more than 90 days after the administratively final decision. Rather, he argues that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion by refusing to equitably toll the 90-day time limitation for filing a motion to reopen on the basis of the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel (Resp. Br. at 14-15).
 
Ineffective assistance of counsel can serve as a basis for equitable tolling, but it must be substantiated and accompanied by a showing of due diligence. See Mahmood v. Gonzales, All F.3d 248, 252 (3d Cir. 2005). An alien seeking to equitably toll the limitation period based on ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate that he has exercised due diligence in raising the claim, and that prejudice resulted from counsel’s alleged errors. Mahmood v. Gonzales, supra, at 251-52; Fadiga v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 488 F.3d 142, 159 (3d Cir. 2007). Prejudice requires an alien to show that there was a “reasonable likelihood that the result would have been different if the error[s] ... had not occurred.” Fadiga v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 159. “Periods of unaccounted-for delay reveal a lack of diligence.” Mahmood v. Gonzales, supra, at 253; see also Alzaarir v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 90 (“Due diligence must be exercised over the entire period for which tolling is desired.”). “This includes both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed.” Alzaarir v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra. The failure to exercise due diligence in asserting an ineffective assistance of counsel undermines any claim for equitable tolling. “Equitable tolling is an extraordinary remedy which should be extended only sparingly.” Mahmood v. Gonzales, supra, at 253 (quoting Hedges v. U.S., 404 F.3d 744, 751 (3d Cir. 2005)).
 
*6 We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s “““assertions of counsel ineffectiveness are without merit” (I.J. at 2). On this record, the respondent has not demonstrated compliance with the procedural requirements for establishing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988).5 The Third Circuit has adopted Lozada’s procedural requirements, but strict compliance is not always required. Pajow v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 515 F.App’x 119, 121 (3d Cir. 2013) (unpublished); Rranci v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 540 F.3d 165, 172-74 (3d Cir. 2008). Having considered the respondent’s appellate contentions, we conclude that he has not demonstrated substantial compliance with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra (Resp. Br. at 7, 14-15). Moreover, the respondent has not accounted for the period of delay in pursuing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
 
To the extent the respondent asserts a due process violation, we are unpersuaded. On this record, the respondent has not shown that the Immigration Judge denied the respondent due process of law by denying his motion to reopen. The respondent has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for a form of relief that either the Immigration Judge or the Board has the authority to grant. Moreover, although the Immigration Judge did not discuss every piece of evidence referred to by the respondent, he did consider the relevant evidence of record. Huang v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 620 F.3d 372, 388 (3d Cir. 2010) (finding that Immigration Judges need not discuss every piece of evidence mentioned by an asylum applicant). We do not conclude that the respondent was in any way prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s handling of her case, or that the hearing was unfair and violated due process. See Delgado-Sobalvarro v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 625 F.3d 782, 787 (3d Cir. 2010); see also Khan v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., supra, at 236; Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 1984); Matter of Exame, 18 I&N Dec. 303 (BIA 1982).
 
Further, the respondent has not demonstrated that the Immigration Judge abandoned his impartial role. An Immigration Judge has the authority to “““interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien” in removal proceedings. See section 240(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(1). See generally Matter of Rhee, 16 I&N Dec. 607 (BIA 1978). Due process requires the alien be afforded a full and fair hearing; however, an Immigration Judge has broad discretion in how he conducts that hearing. See generally Romanishyn v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 455 F.3d 175, 185 (3d Cir. 2006); Khan v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 448 F.3d 226, 236 (3d Cir. 2006); Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, 330 F.3d 587, 596 (3d Cir. 2003). We have reviewed the record and find no basis to conclude that the Immigration Judge was biased or that the Immigration Judge’s questioning or comments in any way exceeded judicial bounds. See Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 556 (1994); Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, supra, at 597; cf. Offutt v. United States, 348 U.S. 11 (1954) (finding that the record reveals an attitude inconsistent with the restraints of conventional judicial demeanor).
 
*7 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

On appeal, the respondent indicates through counsel that the variations of his name, “Armando Ramirez-Castaneda” and “Armando Ramirez-Costaneda” that appear throughout these proceedings are incorrect (Resp. Br. at 2, 22).

2

The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent, through previous counsel, filed a motion to stay removal in conjunction with a motion to reopen proceedings, and on March 28, 2013, the Immigration Court denied the stay request and did not address the underlying motion to reopen (I.J. at 1).

The authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion in immigration cases lies solely with the DHS as the federal agency responsible for the administration and enforcement of federal immigration law. See section 103(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a); see also Beltranena v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 555 F.App’x 198, 201 (3d Cir. 2014) (unpublished) (same); Patel v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 523 F.App’x 121, 124 (3d Cir. 2013) (unpublished) (same). A request for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion may be directed to the DHS. See Matter of Garcia, 21 I&N Dec. 254, 260 (BIA 1996) (finding in relevant part that the decision to institute removal proceedings involves the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and is one which neither the Immigration Judge nor the Board reviews).

4

If the DHS elects to grant the respondent an immigration benefit as a matter of prosecutorial discretion in the future, the parties are not precluded from filing a joint motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(iii).

Pursuant to Lozada, the movant is required to submit to the Board: (1) an affidavit “attesting to the relevant facts,” (2) a report of counsel’s response or failure to respond to the allegations, and (3) information regarding whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, supra.

IN RE: LESY ERENIO SANCHEZ-MATUTE
File: AXXX XX8 848 - San Antonio, TX
May 14, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paula J. Ferreira, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s July 7, 2014, decision denying her motion to reopen. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on July 8, 2013. The appeal will be sustained, the proceedings reopened and the record remanded.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent claimed in her motion to reopen that exceptional circumstances prevented her from attending her July 8, 2013, removal hearing (Resp. Mot. to Reopen at 3-6). Specifically, respondent, through counsel, asserted that her attorney advised her that her pending motion to change venue would be granted and she was not required to attend the hearing; and also that her counsel suffered a computer virus that made his calendar inaccessible (Resp. Mot. to Reopen at 3-6). The Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding that the mere existence of a pending motion to change venue did not relieve the respondent of her duty to attend the hearing, and that the computer virus did not amount to exceptional circumstances (I.J. at 2). On appeal, the respondent, through the same counsel, maintains her claim of exceptional circumstances and further asserts that she is not required to comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), because she is not claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, only that counsel’s incorrect advice constitutes an exceptional circumstance (Resp. Br. at 7).
 
The respondent is correct that both this Board and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this matter arises, have found that the erroneous advice of counsel may constitute an exceptional circumstance excusing the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing. See Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (1996); see also Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 798 (5th Cir. 2007). However, in such a scenario, substantial compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, is still required.1 See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 496-98 (5th Cir. 2000); see also Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 648 (5th Cir. 2014); Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948, 953 (5th Cir. 2012).
 
*2 Based on the totality of the circumstances in this case, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen to rescind her in absentia order pursuant to our sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings.

In Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, supra, and Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, supra, each of the respondents were represented by new counsel and had already complied with Matter of Lozada, supra. See Galvez-Vergara, supra, at 800, 800 n.2; see also Grijalva-Barrera, supra, at 473-74. Here, the respondent is represented by the same counsel who incorrectly advised her on her need to appear for the hearing and has not filed any complaint regarding this conduct. Further, it appears counsel still has not advised the respondent regarding the need to comply with Matter of Lozada, supra.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Edwin T Gania, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Geoffrey P. Gilpin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; adjustment of status
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 17, 2013, ordering him removed after denying his request for a continuance. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) opposes the respondent’s appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994).
 
The Immigration Judge granted the respondent 2 continuances prior to his final hearing (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 9-11, 21-24). In denying the respondent’s request for yet another continuance, the Immigration Judge considered the factors outlined in Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009), and Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009) (I.J. at 3). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6; Matter of Villarreal-Zuniga, 23 I&N Dec. 886, 891 (BIA 2006). The Immigration Judge specifically considered the respondent’s lengthy residence and family ties in this country, and other positive factors such as his business and ownership of rental properties (I.J. at 3-4). The Immigration Judge also considered the DHS’s opposition to any further continuances based on the respondent’s criminal record and his undesirability as a permanent resident (I.J. at 3). The Immigration Judge determined that even if the underlying visa petition were approved, the respondent did not warrant adjustment of status as a matter of discretion (I.J. at 4-5). Pawlowska v. Holder, 623 F.3d 1138, 1140-41 (7th Cir. 2010) (where Immigration Judge denied a continuance based on the conclusion that he would ultimately deny adjustment of status as a discretionary matter).
 
Although the underlying visa petition has since been approved (Respondent’s Brief, Exh. A), we find no basis to remand this matter, or to otherwise disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision, as we agree that the respondent has not demonstrated that he warrants adjustment of status as a matter of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
*2 The Immigration Judge properly weighed and balanced the factors relevant to the exercise of discretion in this case. Although the respondent has many equities and his removal will result in some hardship, as described by the Immigration Judge and the. respondent on appeal (Respondent’s Brief at 5-9), he also has an extensive history of drinking and driving, which the Immigration Judge properly considered as a significant negative factor. Matter of Teixeira, 21 I&N Dec. 316, 321 (BIA 1996) (evidence of criminal activity should be considered in discretionary determinations). The Immigration Judge did not clearly err in finding the respondent’s repeated drank driving violations were serious and that the respondent was a danger to society (I.J. at 5). Portillo-Rendon v. Holder, 662 F.3d 815, 816 (7th Cir. 2011) (finding that the alien exhibited a “disdain for the rules that govern the use of automobiles. Driving while intoxicated or without a license reflects both indifference to the welfare of other drivers and pedestrians and defiance of known legal obligations.”). The respondent’s repeated disregard for the welfare of others demonstrates a pattern of knowingly placing others at risk of harm. For the reasons discussed above and by the Immigration Judge we agree that the respondent’s positive equities are outweighed by the negative factors, and that the respondent has failed to carry his burden of proving that he merits adjustment of status as a matter of discretion. Id; Matter of Blas, 15 I&N Dec. 626, 628-30 (BIA 1974; A.G. 1976); Matter of Arai, 13 I&N Dec. 494 (BIA 1970).
 
While we sympathize with the respondent’s family members, who will undoubtedly experience some hardship in connection with his removal, our overriding obligation is to safeguard the interests of the United States, and not just those of the respondent and those close to him.
 
Although the respondent argues that his former counsel’s inadequate preparation negatively impacted his case (Respondent’s Brief at 3-5), he has failed to meet the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). For example, the respondent has not provided an affidavit setting forth his agreement with former counsel, has not shown that former counsel was given the opportunity to respond to the allegations, and has not filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority. Matter of Lozada, supra. Further, he has not established prejudice. Apouviepseakoda v. Gonzales, 475 F.3d 881, 885 (7th Cir. 2007) (alien must establish prejudice before court would vacate the agency’s decision); Boci v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 762, 768 (7th Cir. 2007) (alien cannot prevail without showing that granting a continuance likely would have affected the result of the hearing). Additionally, the respondent’s disagreement with the Immigration Judge’s decision does not render his conduct a violation of due process (Respondent’s Brief at 3-5). See Khan v. Filip, 554 F.3d 681, 689 (7th Cir. 2009); Zamora-Mallari v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 679, 694 (7th Cir. 2008). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jesus Ruiz Velasco, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michelle M. Venci
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; adjustment of status
 
The respondent, a native of Saudi Arabia and a citizen of Pakistan, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s November 22, 2013, decision denying his request for a continuance, finding he had abandoned his application for adjustment of status, and ordering him deported from the United States to Pakistan. During the pendency of this appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The record will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
 
The respondent seeks adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), based on an approved immediate relative visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife. At the scheduled merits hearing on November 22, 2013, the respondent requested a continuance for several reasons. He had just retained current counsel who had only recently reviewed the record of proceedings. The respondent’s prior counsel had provided current counsel with the respondent’s file just days before the merits hearing. The respondent’s United States citizen wife was taking exams in Pakistan and could not be present at the hearing. And, the respondent had just been indicted for a controlled substance crime and the criminal proceedings were pending. See Respondent’s Motion to Continue.
 
The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent did not establish good cause for a continuance and denied his motion (Tr. at 33-34). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29 (a motion to continue may be granted for good cause). She found the continuance motion untimely filed as the written motion was submitted in Court the day of the merits hearing. She determined that the respondent’s current counsel had reviewed the record 2 weeks prior to the hearing and had done nothing to prepare the case, including filing required documents (medical report and affidavit of support) and ensuring the biometrics were complete. She determined that there was no reason to continue based on the respondent’s pending criminal case because the outcome was speculative. She observed that the respondent had been in proceedings since 2009. The Immigration Judge also concluded that because the respondent did not complete the required biometrics, he abandoned his applications for relief (Tr. at 34-35). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.47(d).
 
*2 During the pendency of this appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand premised on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his prior counsel. We find a remand of the record is warranted in this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992) (the requirements for a motion to remand are essentially the same as the requirements for a motion to reopen); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4). The documentation filed in support of the respondent’s motion to remand is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent’s motion is supported by documentation that satisfies the procedural requirements articulated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (holding that an alien making an ineffective assistance claim must: (1) present an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement with former counsel and representations by counsel in this regard; (2) inform counsel of allegations of ineffective conduct and afford counsel the opportunity to respond, and (3) file a bar complaint or explain the reasons for not doing so).
 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agrees that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Lozada, but asserts that the respondent has failed to establish that prior counsel prejudiced his case. See DHS Brief at 9-10. The DHS relies on the finding of the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois, that the respondent did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that prior counsel violated the Rules of Professional Conduct. See Respondent’s Brief, Exhibit D.
 
However, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois, prior counsel stated that he filed a motion to terminate on February 2, 2012, he filed an adjustment application on July 3, 2012, and he prepared and filed all paperwork for which the respondent was eligible. See Respondent’s Brief, Exhibit D. Yet, the record does not contain a motion to terminate. The adjustment application appears to have been incorrectly filed with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). And, the respondent had not updated his biometric information. Although prior counsel represented the respondent for nearly 2 years, the record reveals that the only document he filed was a motion for substitution of counsel.
 
Because the respondent has submitted evidence that has not yet been considered by the Immigration Judge, which potentially bears on her rulings, we will remand the record for further factual findings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (stating that the Board may not engage in fact finding in the course of deciding appeals except for taking administrative notice of commonly known facts); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002) (in light of Board’s limited fact-finding ability on appeal, a remand is appropriate when the record is inadequate for review). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: JULIO ALVARO CARTAGENA-AVELAR
File: AXXX XX8 174 - Los Angeles, CA
April 30, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Roger H. Ponce, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)] - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s December 11, 2014, decision denying his motion to reopen, which he filed on October 6, 2014. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia on October 23, 2003, for his failure to appear for a scheduled hearing. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
In his Motion to Reopen, the respondent challenged the in absentia order of removal, arguing that he did not receive timely notice of the October 23, 2003, hearing because (1) he was not living at the address of record due to a dispute with his aunt, with whom he was living, and (2) he did not receive notice of the hearing from his attorney, who had appeared at a prior hearing on his behalf. The respondent argues both that he did not receive notice of the hearing, and that his failure to appear should be excused based on exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). The motion to reopen did not contain evidence to support the contentions about a lack of notice or exceptional circumstances, such as an affidavit from the respondent or his aunt, or evidence that the respondent was pursuing any claims against his former attorney, who he alleges failed to provide him with adequate representation and/or a copy of the notice of the hearing. The respondent did provide with his motion copies of the birth certificates of his children and step-daughter, and evidence supporting the medical needs of his step-daughter.
 
In general, only one motion to reopen may be filed to reopen an administratively final order of removal. This must be filed within 90 days of the entry of such order, state new facts that will be proven, and be supported by evidence of those facts. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii), an order of removal entered in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Act may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal, if based on exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). A motion to reopen based on a lack of notice under section 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act may be filed at any time. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
*2 In her decision denying the motion, the Immigration Judge made the following factual findings, without clear error. First, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent entered as a juvenile1 and was released into the custody of his aunt (I.J. at 1). He appeared at a hearing on February 27, 2003, and admitted the charge of inadmissibility (Id.). A notice resetting the respondent’s hearing until September 18, 2003, was mailed to the respondent in June 2003 to his address of record (his aunt’s home) and to his attorney (I.J. at 1-2). On September 18, 2003, the respondent did not appear but his attorney who was present indicated that he had made attempts to contact the respondent (I.J. at 2). At the attorney’s request, proceedings were continued (I.J. at 2). A notice was personally served on the attorney indicating that the next hearing would occur on October 23, 2003 (Id.). On that date, the attorney appeared and indicated that he had made multiple attempts to contact the respondent, but the respondent again failed to appear and was ordered removed in absentia (Id.). The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed some 11 years later, on October 6, 2014 (Id.).
 
Based on the above, we find no cause to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision. To the extent that the respondent argues that exceptional circumstances prevented him from attending the September and October 2003 hearings in his immigration proceedings--specifically that he lacked maturity and was in a conflict with his aunt, with whom he was living2--we agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the argument was not raised within the requisite 180 days, as set by regulation (I.J. at 2-3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Indeed, the respondent did not file his motion for over 10 years after the entry of the in absentia order of removal. Moreover, the respondent bears the burden to establish that exceptional circumstances existed, and he has not met this burden inasmuch as he has not proffered evidence (such as a sworn affidavit from him or his aunt) to show that he was not living at his address of record, and was prevented from accessing his mail. Statements of counsel in a brief or other filing are not evidence. Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980).3
 
To the extent that the respondent argues that they delay in filing his motion is immaterial because he never received notice of the October 2003 hearing, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that this argument is unavailing, in light of the fact that the notice was served on his attorney of record. See I.J. at 2. Service of the notice of hearing on the respondent’s attorney was adequate to reflect that notice was provided under applicable precedent. Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 185 (2001). Although the respondent argues in the motion and on appeal that the attorney did not provide adequate representation and did not provide him with the notice, this claim lacks support. The contention that the attorney only “made one appearance” on the respondent’s behalf, on February 27, 2003, is belied by the fact that the attorney actually appeared twice thereafter when the respondent failed to do so. The respondent has not argued that this finding is clearly erroneous. No affidavit from the respondent avers that the attorney failed to give him notice of the hearing. Indeed, the respondent has not supported any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with, e.g., notice of such a claim to the attorney or applicable state bar office, or by filing an affidavit detailing the agreement between himself and the attorney. Cf. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*3 We find no cause to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen these proceedings. As the Immigration Judge noted, the motion lacks evidence to support it. Furthermore, the respondent’s claim that he is eligible to apply for adjustment of status lacks support in the form of evidence that he is the beneficiary of an approved, immediately available visa (I.J. at 4).
 
For the foregoing reasons, the appeal will be dismissed and the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent states on appeal that he was 17 years old when he entered the United States in June 2001 (Respondent’s Brief at 2).

The respondent also claims that tension arose with his aunt when his then-girlfriend got pregnant and he had to move out to get a full-time job to support his girlfriend and expected child. See Respondent’s Brief at 3. No evidence regarding the birth of this child is part of the record.

We note that even the statements in the motion are vague in this regard, since it is unclear exactly when the respondent stopped residing at his aunt’s home, given his failure to appear for the September 2003 hearing, and the fact that the notice of this hearing was mailed to him in June 2003, just a few months after he provided notice of this address to immigration officials. Therefore, even if they were taken as true, the assertions would not establish exceptional circumstances.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew W. Buck, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 By a decision of an Immigration Judge of November 7, 2013, the motion to reopen filed by the respondent on September 4, 2013, was denied. The respondent appealed.1 The appeal will be dismissed based upon the respondent’s failure to file an appeal brief after stating in his Notice of Appeal that such a brief would be filed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E). Moreover, the motion asserted a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel however the respondent has failed to comply with the requirements necessary to make such a claim. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988). Although, the respondent has submitted an affidavit, as well as one prepared by a former counsel, no bar complaint has been filed. Therefore, we agree with the Immigration Judge that there is insufficient basis to grant the respondent’s motion to reopen. To the extent that the respondent seeks humanitarian relief to enable him to remain in the United States, such relief is to be pursued with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). Likewise, any request for relief from removal in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion must also be made to the DHS. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

File: AXXX XX1 136 - Denver, CO
April 15, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alexander D. McShiras, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kalin Ivany
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s July 22, 2013, denial of his motion to reopen. The respondent’s request for oral argument will be denied and his appeal will be dismissed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7) (2015).
 
As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent--through counsel--admitted the allegations contained in the Notice to Appear (Exh. 1) and conceded the above charge of removability (I.J. at 1 (citing Exh. 2 (Respondent’s Written Pleadings)). After granting the respondent a continuance on August 23, 2012-- for the adjudication of an I-130 visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife--the Immigration Judge granted his ensuing request for pre-conclusion voluntary departure on January 10, 2013 (i.e., based on his counsel’s statement that the I-130 petition was approved and that the respondent sought voluntary departure so he could adjust status through consular processing) (I.J. at 1-2). See I.J.’s January 10, 2013, Order; see also I.J. at 2-3 (noting that the respondent, despite being informed in Spanish of the consequences of failing to comply with his voluntary departure order, stayed in the country beyond April 10, 2013, the last day in which he could depart while still complying with the Immigration Judge’s Order). The respondent claims in his motion to reopen--which was filed on May 16, 2013-- that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel because his prior attorney denied him a reasonable opportunity to present his applications for adjustment of status and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”). See Respondent’s Motion at 7-16.
 
We find that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion. On appeal, the respondent takes issue with the Immigration Judge’s decision that he did not comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), in filing a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 3). Despite the respondent’s varied contentions on appeal (Respondent’s Br. at 9-14), he has shown no error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that he did not meet Lozada’s requirements because he “submitted no independent evidence of having informed [his prior counsel] Mr. De Pedro of the allegations against him” (I.J. at 3).1 See Tang v. Ashcroft, 354 F.3d 1192, 1196 (10th Cir. 2003) (in order to assert an ineffective assistance claim, an alien must comply with the Board’s Lozada requirements). Nonetheless, even assuming that the respondent satisfied Lozada’s requirements as he contends, he has not demonstrated that reopening is warranted.
 
*2 The Immigration Judge correctly held that the respondent’s motion was filed beyond the 90-day filing period and is therefore untimely (I.J. at 3). See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the final order of removal, which in this case was January 10, 2013). In this regard, while equitable tolling may permit reopening beyond the above time limit when an alien shows that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel--and was prejudiced as a result--we see no error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent “““does not merit equitable tolling because he . . . has not presented evidence that he acted with due diligence in seeking to reopen his case” (I.J. at 3).
 
As discussed by the Immigration Judge, none of the respondent’s materials in his motion to reopen “indicate[d] that he took any steps to discover whether he had any alternate options [regarding his immigration status] until after the expiration of the voluntary departure and reopening periods” (I.J. at 3) (emphasis added). See Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) Br. at 4 (noting that the respondent did not file his motion to reopen “until over one month after he failed to depart”). Indeed, the respondent’s own affidavit-- which was attached to his motion to reopen--is dated April 10, 2013 (i.e., the last day in which he could timely file a motion to reopen following the Immigration Judge’s January 10, 2013, order) and fails to even discuss his prior attorney’s alleged ineffective assistance. We are not persuaded by the respondent’s account that his purported confusion regarding the voluntary departure order somehow justifies his “mistaken impression that he could appeal the decision at any time” (Respondent’s Br. at 6). The respondent articulates no plausible basis that would reasonably explain his belief in this regard. See, e.g., Riley v. INS, 310 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2002); Galvez Pineda v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 833, 838-39 (10th Cir. 2005) (discussing the petitioners’ lack of sufficient diligence to justify equitable tolling of the 90-day period for seeking reopening and concluding that “any absence of evidence favorable to equitable tolling was the [petitioners’] fault, as they had the burden of persuasion on the motion to reopen”).
 
Moreover, the fact that the respondent’s complaint against Mr. De Pedro was dismissed on April 23, 2013, by the Colorado Office of Attorney Regulation Counsel belies his claim that he detrimentally relied on “Mr. De Pedro’s bad advice” (Respondent’s Br. at 6, 12). To the extent that he cites Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U.S. 1, 18-23 (2008), for the proposition that filing a motion to reopen will nullify the consequence of failing to depart within the voluntary departure period (Respondent’s Br. at 7), the respondent does not recognize that the United States Supreme Court held that filing a motion to reopen during the voluntary departure period and requesting a withdrawal of voluntary departure will nullify the consequence of failing to timely depart. See id.; see also DHS’s Br. at 5-6. As the respondent filed his motion well after the expiration of the period of voluntary departure, his reliance on Dada v. Mukasey, supra, is misplaced. Based on the foregoing, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the motion was untimely, and equitable tolling of the time limit was unwarranted as the respondent’s claims of due diligence are not supported by the record (I.J. at 3). See generally Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (allowing equitable tolling of deadlines on motions to reopen “when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error”).
 
*3 Furthermore, because the respondent has remained beyond the period of voluntary departure, the voluntary departure order has terminated and converted to an order of removal to Mexico (I.J. at 4). Also, given his failure to timely depart and decision to file a motion to reopen outside of the voluntary departure period, he is subject to the consequences of failing to depart under the Act, including being barred from adjustment of status for a period of 10 years (I.J. at 4). See section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(a), (e)(2). Despite the respondent’s arguments on appeal (Respondent’s Br. at 7-9), he has not cited to any binding case law to show that he is not subject to the penalty provisions for failure to depart within the time period afforded for voluntary departure under section 240B(d)(1) of the Act. See DHS’s Br. at 4 (noting that the respondent (1) was granted voluntary departure until April 10, 2013; (2) accepted the Court’s decision in this regard; and (3) did not show that his non-compliance with the Court’s order was the result of his prior attorney’s representation as he opted to remain in the country after receiving the necessary warnings and consequences regarding failing to comply with the voluntary departure order). Moreover, the Board lacks authority to apply an “exceptional circumstances” or any other equitable exception to the penalty provisions for failure to depart within the time period afforded for voluntary departure under section 240B(d)(1) of the Act. See Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87, 92 (BIA 2007) (noting that the voluntary departure agreement comes with warnings of the consequences of failing to depart within the time granted while citing the penalties listed under section 240B(d) of the Act).2
 
In addition, upon our de novo review under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii), we conclude that the respondent did not establish any prejudice as a result of his prior attorney’s representation. See Matter of Assaad, supra, at 556. Despite the respondent’s contentions on appeal (Respondent’s Br. at 13-17), he has not met his burden of proving prejudice or fundamental unfairness. See U.S. v. Sandoval, 390 F.3d 1294, 1299 (10th Cir. 2004). Specifically, he has not shown that but for the ineffective assistance of counsel, there was a reasonable likelihood that he would have been entitled to a different outcome, which in this context would be continued residence in the United States. See U.S. v. Aguirre-Tello, 353 F.3d 1199, 1208 (en banc) (10th Cir. 2004) (A showing of prejudice means that there is a reasonable likelihood that, but for the errors complained of, the applicant would not have been deported) (internal citations omitted). In particular, the respondent cites to no objectively reliable evidence in the record to support his contention that his prior attorney erred by conceding that he “was not inspected and admitted to the United States,” and as such, he has not shown that he is in this country pursuant to a lawful admission and is not subject to removal (Respondent’s Br. at 14-16).
 
*4 Also, despite stating that his former attorney failed to apply for DACA and adjustment of status (Respondent’s Br. at 14), the respondent has not established eligibility for adjustment of status given his inadmissibility under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act, and he has not shown a reasonable likelihood of obtaining DACA relief. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988) (an applicant seeking reopening must establish prima facie eligibility for the underlying relief sought). Further, as to the latter, neither the Board nor the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction over the DHS regarding issues of prosecutorial discretion. See, e.g., Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 349-50 (BIA 1982) (deferred action status is a function of DHS’s prosecutorial grace). To the extent that he states that “former counsel failed to seek administrative closure” under Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012) (Respondent’s Br. at 14), he has not provided any meaningfully discussion of the relevant factors we announced in Matter of Avetisyan, supra, in examining weather administrative closure is warranted. We likewise find no prejudice by his former counsel’s “fail[ure] to preserve an appeal of the voluntary departure decision” given that a grant of voluntary departure prior to completion of proceedings under section 240B(a) of the Act requires an express waiver of the alien’s right to appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1).
 
In sum, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent has not met his burden of establishing that the filing deadline for his motion to reopen should be equitably tolled and we are unable to find that he was prejudiced due to his prior attorney’s representation as he has not shown that there was a reasonable likelihood of qualifying for the relief sought but for such representation. See Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 420 (1996). While the respondent has offered several documents on appeal, this Board may not accept such materials into the record as it is precluded from fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Further, as the respondent has not established any legal or clear factual error in the Immigration Judge’s decision, we find no basis to reopen or to remand this case for any reason. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Under Matter of Lozada, supra, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be supported by (1) an affidavit setting out the agreement entered into with counsel, (2) proof that notice of the allegations and an opportunity to respond has been provided to counsel whose representation was allegedly ineffective, and (3) the filing of a complaint with appropriate disciplinary authorities or an explanation for the failure to file a complaint. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 561-62 (BIA 2003) (requiring prejudice stemming from prior counsel’s actions in addition to compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra).

We have held that, absent egregious circumstances, a tactical decision by an attorney is binding on his or her client. See Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938, 942 (BIA 1995); Matter of Valasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986). We do not find that the instant case demonstrates egregious circumstances (Respondent’s Br. at 14-15). See generally Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 934 (9th Cir. 1986) (finding that the decision to forego contesting deportability in favor of a generous grant of voluntary departure is a tactical choice, while stating that the attorney “did so based on his belief that pending amnesty legislation would allow petitioners to become lawful permanent residents,” and “[a]lthough looking at this now [in hindsight] we might find this tactical choice to have been unwise, we nevertheless find that it did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel”).

IN RE: RUEBEN ARCHIBALD NELSON

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jack Andreas Krumbein, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Leigh Mapplebeck
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision of November 20, 2013, denying his untimely motion to reopen proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) requests that the Immigration Judge’s decision be upheld. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of fact by an Immigration Judge only to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(I); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Motions to reopen are generally disfavored, and the limitations upon them are strictly enforced. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 107-08 (1988) (observing that granting such motions too freely will permit endless delay of deportation by aliens creative and fertile enough to continuously produce new and material facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case); Wang v. Board of Immigration Appeals, 437 F.3d 270, 274 (2d Cir. 2006) (endorsing a strict limitation on motions to reopen and observing that it would be ironic if aliens like the respondent who have remained in the United States illegally following an order of deportation were allowed to have “a second and third bite at the apple” simply because he managed to marry and have children while evading authorities); Cao v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 421 F.3d 149, 156 (2d Cir. 2005) (citing Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992)). Thus, with certain limited exceptions, an alien is permitted to file one motion to reopen a final administrative order of deportation, not later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent filed his motion to reopen on November 4, 2013, more than 6 years after the entry of the final administrative order on June 8, 2007. Therefore, the motion was untimely.
 
The respondent was last in removal proceedings in 2007. He was represented by former counsel, Ms. Moidel, and found to be removable as charged and statutorily ineligible for relief under former section 212(c) or section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(c), (h). He reserved appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision, but never ultimately perfected an appeal. The respondent was subsequently removed from the United States. On November 4, 2013, he filed to reopen proceedings, alleging that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel from his former attorney. The government opposed reopening. The Immigration Judge rejected the grounds put forth for reopening and denied the motion.
 
*2 For an alien raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the untimeliness of the motion may be excused under the doctrine of equitable tolling. In addition to complying with the procedural requirements for such a claim, the alien must show prejudice as a result of his counsel’s ineffective assistance and that he exercised due diligence during the period he seeks to toll. See Jian Hua Wang v. BIA, 508 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir. 2007); Celtic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
The respondent contends on appeal that the Immigration Judge should have found ineffective assistance of counsel prejudiced him. The respondent asserts that he never met his prior counsel, that she was ineffective for appearing telephonically and for not filing a brief on his eligibility for relief or for insisting on a merits hearing.
 
Upon review, we affirm the result below, denying reopening. We find first no clear error in any of the Immigration Judge’s findings regarding the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). A motion to reopen claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must substantially comply with the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, supra. In Lozada, we held that (1) the motion must be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) the motion must show that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) the motion must reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640.
 
The respondent has not filed a bar complaint against his former attorney. The requirement that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim demonstrate the filing of a bar complaint serves to deter meritless claims and highlights the standards that should be expected of attorneys who represent aliens in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. It also serves to protect against collusion between alien and counsel in which “ineffective assistance” is tolerated, and goes unchallenged by an alien before disciplinary authorities, because it results in a benefit to the alien in that delay can be a desired end, in itself, in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 604 (BIA 1996).
 
*3 Some explanations for not filing a bar complaint may excuse the failure. See e.g. Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding reasonable explanation where employee in attorney’s office who was responsible for recording hearing dates had been suffering from illnesses about which the attorney was unaware, and calendared the hearing date, and the attorney took full responsibility for the error in front of the Immigration Judge the next business day). In this case, the respondent alleges that he lacked the resources to necessary to file a bar complaint. The respondent statement is not, however, adequate to excuse the failure to file a bar complaint, particularly given that the respondent was able to file his motion to reopen despite the same lack of resources in Jamaica. The respondent’s lack of compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, was a proper reason to deny the motion to reopen.
 
More fundamentally, the respondent was not prejudiced by Ms. Moidel’s representation of him because at the time of his June 8, 2007, hearing, he was removable as charged and not eligible for relief. While the case law has changed since his hearing, Ms. Moidel relied on the law at the time and the respondent’s desire to be released from detention. Since the respondent cannot prove prejudice, we dismiss his other due process claims as well. See Matter of Assaad, supra; Matter of D-, 20 I&N Dec. 827, 831 (BIA 1994); Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 1984); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-7 (BIA 1983). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose Enrique Perez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated November 4, 2013. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s applications for voluntary departure under sections 240B(a) and (b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229c(a) and (b). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in appeals are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent does not appeal from the Immigration Judge’s determination that he did not establish his eligibility for voluntary departure (I.J. at 3). See sections 240(c)(4)(A)(i), (ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A)(i), (ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). Therefore, this issue is waived. See, e.g., Matter of Cervantes, 22 I&N Dec. 560, 561 n.1 (BIA 1999) (expressly declining to address an issue not raised by party on appeal); Matter of Gutierrez, 19 I&N Dec. 562, 565 n.3 (BIA 1988) (same).
 
Rather, on appeal, the respondent objects to the admissibility of the Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien, Form I-213. However, the I-213 is a record made by public officials in the ordinary course of their duties and is accorded strong indicia of reliability. See Felzceek v. INS, 75 F.3d 112, 116 (2d Cir. 1996). Moreover, neither before the Immigration Judge nor on appeal has the respondent articulated any basis for his objection to the I-213 other than generally alleging error. On this record, the respondent did not make a prima facie case for suppression. See generally Matter of Barcenas, 19 I&N Dec. 609 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for a further continuance to retain a new attorney and explore his potential eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. A party seeking a continuance has the burden to establish good cause for the continuance. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. In this regard, the Immigration Judge acknowledged the respondent’s general statement that he feared returning to Guatemala (I.J. at 1). However, the record reflects that the respondent was represented at prior proceedings and did not request any other relief from removal other than voluntary departure (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 11). The record further indicates that the proceedings were continued for the sole purpose of allowing the respondent to establish his eligibility for voluntary departure (Tr. at 11-12). In this regard, we have held that, absent egregious circumstances, a tactical decision by an attorney (in this case deciding to pursue only voluntary departure) is binding on his client. See Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938, 942 (BIA 1995); Matter of Valasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986). The respondent has not alleged any egregious circumstances; nor do we find any such circumstances on this record. Indeed, the respondent has not alleged that his prior attorney was ineffective or complied with the procedural requirements, as set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Prior to the reconvened hearing on the respondent’s application for voluntary departure, the respondent fired his attorney and did not secure a new attorney prior to his next scheduled hearing. In addition, the respondent did not file any motion for a continuance prior to the hearing as required by the Immigration Court Practice Manual.
 
*2 Considering it was the respondent’s choice to fire his prior attorney and the absence of any viable legal theory of relief from removal, the respondent did not show good cause for an additional continuance. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 422, 424 (BIA 1987) (Immigration Judge’s denial of a motion for a continuance will not be overturned on appeal unless the respondent demonstrates that the denial deprived her of a full and fair hearing). Indeed, the viability of the respondent’s proposed asylum application is doubtful considering that the respondent appears time-barred pursuant to section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B) from pursuing relief under that section. In addition, the respondent has not proffered any testimony or theory of relief for withholding of removal under the Act, or for protection under the Convention Against Torture that might have been presented had he retained new counsel. Nor has respondent submitted an I-589 or any other application, even now on appeal, to establish prima facie eligibility for any relief from removal. On this record, the respondent has not presented sufficient evidence to indicate that if proceedings were continued and had the respondent retained a new attorney that the ultimate result in the disposition of the case would be different. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992) (explaining that a party who seeks a remand or to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case).
 
In sum, we find nothing in the Immigration Judge’s order or in the manner in which the proceedings were conducted to indicate that the respondent’s due process rights were violated or that he was denied a full and fair hearing. See Matter of D-, 20 I&N Dec. 827, 831 (BIA 1994); Matter of Tomas, 19 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1987).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: ALFREDO PIMENTEL-ARAGON
File: AXXX XX2 906 - Atlanta, GA
March 17, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Elliott Ozment, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Wylly Jordan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Remand; voluntary departure
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 6, 2013, finding him removable from the United States, and granting his application for voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(1). The appeal will be dismissed in part and sustained in part.
 
The Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
In his appellate brief, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge incorrectly denied his motion to withdraw his concession of removability. In addition, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge set an unreasonably high voluntary departure bond.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not established egregious circumstances to withdraw his former attorney’s concession of removability. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (holding that absent egregious circumstances, a party is bound by his/her attorney’s conduct, including admissions). The respondent argues that his current attorney has discovered that the government has engaged in egregious conduct by requiring his detention in Alabama for an unreasonable period, and thus evidence could be suppressed impacting his removability (Resp. Brief at 9, 15; Motion to Withdraw Plea). However, the respondent’s allegation is insufficient to withdraw his concession of removability.
 
In addition, the respondent argues that his former counsel’s written concession of removability, filed on March 8, 2012, in connection with a motion to change venue, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel (Resp. Brief at 11-18). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel). See also Ali v. U.S. Atty. Gen, 643 F.3d 1324 (11th Cir. 2011) (requiring that an alien establish prejudice from an attorney’s concession of removability). The respondent has not satisfied any of the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, the respondent has not submitted any evidence establishing that he may not be removable from the United States, and thus has not shown that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s concession. In fact, on May 4, 2011 the respondent admitted in court the factual bases for the finding of inadmissibility (Tr. at 8). In light of the foregoing, the respondent has not established an egregious circumstance to withdraw his concession of removability.
 
*2 However, we agree with the respondent’s appellate argument that the Immigration Judge required that he post an unduly high voluntary departure bond (I.J. at 2-3). Section 240B(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(3), states that an alien permitted to depart voluntarily under that subsection shall be required to post a voluntary departure bond “in an amount necessary to ensure that the alien will depart.” The Immigration Judge determined that a $20,000 bond was necessary to ensure compliance with the voluntary departure grant (I.J. at 2-3). Based on the totality of the evidence, we find that a bond of $1,000 is sufficient to ensure the respondent’s departure within the time period specified. Accordingly, we will vacate the Immigration Judge’s grant of voluntary departure and alternatively grant the respondent a 60-day period of voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(b) of the Act upon the payment of a bond in the amount of $1,000.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and sustained in part.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s grant of voluntary departure is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Conditioned upon compliance with the provisions of the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent must post a voluntary departure bond in the amount of $1,000 with the DHS within 5 business days of the date of this order. If the bond is not posted within 5 business days, the order of voluntary departure is automatically vacated on the following business day, and the respondent is ordered removed as provided by the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
*3 WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

IN RE: IN SIL KIM-CHOI A.K.A. IN SIL CHOI
File: AXXX XX7 821 - Los Angeles, CA
March 15, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Claire H. Kim, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of South Korea, was ordered removed by an Immigration Judge on May 8, 2012. At that time, the respondent agreed to pre-conclusion voluntary departure. On August 29, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, and now appeals the February 9, 2015, decision denying the motion. The respondent seeks reopening so that the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) can exercise its prosecutorial discretion not to pursue her removal; or in the alternative, for these proceedings to be administratively closed. The DHS has submitted nothing in favor of the respondent’s motion or appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed for the reasons stated therein. The respondent does not dispute the Immigration Judge’s determination that the motion is untimely, and that an exception to 90-day time limit for filing such a motion has not been demonstrated. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Although the respondent alludes to prior ineffective assistance of counsel, she has not attempted to set forth a claim to reopen proceedings on that basis. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of reopening proceedings sua sponte. Although the respondent asserts that she cooperated with authorities to aid a prosecution, and apparently received a temporary stay of removal from the DHS, she did not depart voluntarily as agreed, and--in any event--has no further basis to remain in the United States. The respondent notes that the DHS has not filed an opposition to her motion, but we note that there is nothing to indicate that the DHS has consented to reopening for any purpose, including to exercise its prosecutorial discretion in these concluded proceedings. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). As the respondent has no prospective relief potentially available, there was no basis for the Immigration Judge to reopen and administratively close proceedings. See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012).
 
In light of the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Elif Keles, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 This case is before us on certification by the Immigration Judge following a remand for forwarding of a reconstructed record of proceedings to the Board. The respondent, a native and citizen of Taiwan, filed a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 14, 2013, which denied his request for a continuance and pretermitted his application for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(i).1 The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a brief or other response. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The factual findings of the Immigration Judge are reviewed to determine whether they are “clearly erroneous.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). All other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges, including legal and discretionary determinations and applications of law to fact, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to establish good cause for a continuance (I.J. at 7-8). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 355 (BIA 1983); see also Ahmed v. Holder, 569 F.3d 1009 (9th Cir. 2009). On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by denying him a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief of his 1999 controlled substance offense (Resp. Br. at 4-5). The mere pendency of a collateral attack on a conviction does not mean that the conviction is not final for immigration purposes (I.J. at 8). See Matter of Cardenas Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996) (stating that collateral attacks upon a respondent’s conviction do not operate to negate the finality of the conviction unless and until the conviction is overturned); Matter of Ozkok, 19 I&N Dec. 546, 551-53 (BIA 1988). The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent was warned of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea (I.J. at 8; Exh. 2, at 5). While the respondent asserts on appeal that he was not given any immigration advisals regarding the deferred entry of judgment, he has not shown that he is likely to succeed in having the deferral vacated (I.J. at 8; Respondent’s Appeal Brief; Respondent’s Notice of Appeal). Moreover, to date he has not shown that the deferral has been vacated.
 
*2 Furthermore, the respondent has failed to show prejudice (Respondent’s Appeal Brief; Respondent’s Notice of Appeal). To date, the respondent has not shown that his deferral has been vacated.
 
The respondent also argues that he was denied counsel (Resp. Br. at 6-7). We are not persuaded by his arguments in this regard. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent was given approximately a year with his first attorney to prepare his case and present legal arguments, which was a sufficient amount of time (I.J. at 8).2 Furthermore, when he appeared with his second attorney, whom he hired at the eleventh hour merely to request a continuance, she withdrew as counsel due to lack of cooperation by the respondent (Resp. Br. at 6-7; I.J. at 8; Tr. at 41-42; Motion to Withdraw as Attorney of Record).
 
The denial of a continuance will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing, and here the respondent has not established such (Respondent’s Notice of Appeal; Respondent’s Appeal Brief). See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusions denying the respondent’s request for a continuance. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent has not contested the Immigration Judge’s determination that he was convicted of an offense relating to a controlled substance which renders him permanently ineligible for adjustment of status under section 245(i) (I.J. at 2-7).

2

The respondent states that prior counsel has been disciplined by the Massachusetts bar for poor representation, but he has not established the Mr. Byrd provided inadequate representation in the respondent’s immigration proceedings, and we see no evidence of per se ineffective assistance of counsel (Resp. Br. at 6).). See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (dispensing with the Lozada requirements where ineffective assistance of counsel was obvious and undisputed on the face of the record).

Billy Sapp
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before us on November 13, 2014, when we reopened the respondent’s removal proceedings for the limited purpose of reinstating the 60-day period of voluntary departure. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen to allow him to pursue a U visa as well as prosecutorial discretion under the newly announced deferred action plan. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The agency lacks the authority to grant or review both forms of relief sought by the respondent. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) has exclusive jurisdiction over U visa petitions. See Matter of Sanchez Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 811-12 (BIA 2012); see also 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c). An exercise of prosecutorial discretion is granted exclusively by the DHS. Accordingly, reopening of these proceedings is not warranted for the respondent to pursue either form of relief. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2009) (holding that the Board generally lacks the authority to reopen a proceeding to allow an alien the opportunity to seek relief from removal where the agency lacks jurisdiction over the form of relief sought).1
 
We are also unpersuaded by the respondent’s claim that reopening is warranted on account of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has not complied with the procedural safeguards set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) or otherwise provided sufficient evidence or explanation to establish a valid ineffective assistance claim an explanation of his agreement with prior counsel. See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741, 746 (4th Cir. 2006) (explaining that, while strict compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, is not required in every case, the procedural safeguards set forth therein “provide[] a useful framework for assessing ineffective assistance claims”). Furthermore, the respondent has not established that his proceedings were so fundamentally unfair that he was prevented from establishing his eligibility for a U visa, as he still may pursue that form of relief before USCIS. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638.
 
Finally, we decline to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen these proceedings as the respondent has not established an exceptional circumstance warranting reopening. 8 C.F.R. 1003.2(a); Matter of Yauri, supra; see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Veronica Reyes, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Geoffrey D. Rieman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 4, 2013. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s December 10, 2012, motion to reopen proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on October 23, 2012, pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and 240(e)(1) of the Act (defining “exceptional circumstances”). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent has not specifically contested any of the Immigration Judge’s legal or factual findings (DHS’s Br. at 1). The respondent’s Notice of Appeal (“NOA”) merely states that he “believes that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen.” See NOA at 2. The DHS also correctly notes that the respondent’s brief “fails to specify [any] alleged error in the Immigration Judge’s decision.” See DHS’s Br. at 1 (stating that the respondent “simply argues that he was prejudiced by [his former counsel’s] ineffective assistance” but that he has failed to comply with the procedural requirements to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988)). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Tang v. Ashcroft, 354 F.3d 1192, 1196 (10th Cir. 2003) (holding that in order to assert an ineffective assistance claim, an alien must comply with the Boards Lozada requirements).
 
In sum, the respondent provides no substantive discussion of whether the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen. See Respondent’s Br. at 1-3. Without a meaningful challenge to any of the Immigration Judge’s findings, we see no basis to disturb the Immigration Judge’s order. See Matter of Cervantes-Gonzalez, 22 I&N Dec. 560, 561 n.1 (BIA 1999) (declining to address an issue not raised by a party on appeal); see also Becker v. Kroll, 494 F.3d 904, 913 n.6 (10th Cir. 2007) (holding that an issue “““insufficiently raised in the opening brief is deemed waived”).
 
*2 Based on the foregoing, we will affirm the Immigration Judge’s January 4, 2013, decision for the reasons stated therein. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX4 421 - Chicago, IL

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maria Baldini-Potermin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Patrick M. McKenna
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)] - Controlled substance violation
 
Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated June 9, 2014, ordering him removed from the United States to Mexico.1 The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand the proceedings to the Immigration Court.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including any determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that his prior counsel provided him with ineffective assistance by not seeking asylum, withholding of removal, protection under the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”), or voluntary departure on his behalf. The respondent’s motion is accompanied by an affidavit setting forth his agreement with counsel and asserting that he had asked his former attorney of the possibility of seeking asylum or voluntary departure; an affidavit from the respondent’s girlfriend detailing her interactions with the respondent’s former counsel; copies of payment receipts from the respondent’s former counsel; a completed asylum application; and a copy of a January 16, 2015, letter to the respondent’s former counsel informing him of the allegations of ineffective assistance. The respondent also indicated that he will file a bar complaint no later than February 3, 2015, in order to first give former counsel an opportunity to respond to the allegations of ineffective assistance, and he will supplement the record with a copy of the bar complaint and with his former counsel’s response, if any. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
The Board has limited ability to engage in fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). The determination whether the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel, and, if so, whether he was prejudiced, involves findings of fact. Therefore, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge to address the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim and to decide whether further proceedings are warranted to allow the respondent an opportunity to apply for asylum or other forms of relief from removal. By remanding the record, we are not suggesting a desired outcome.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

The issue regarding the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request for a continuance has been waived on appeal. See, e.g., Capric v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 1075, 1089 (7th Cir. 2004) (finding alien did not preserve for appeal due process challenge to admission of evidence where notice of appeal stated hearing did not comport with requirements of due process but appeal brief made no allegations regarding admission of such evidence).

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: IHAB GAMAL EL DIN EL ZOHAIRY
File: AXXX XX6 561 - Las Vegas, NV
February 25, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John D. Friedman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
An Mai Nguyen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; continuance; voluntary departure
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 27, 2013, pretermitting his application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), and denying his motion to continue to file a new I-130 visa petition. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for a continuance and pretermitted his application for adjustment of status because he did not have a visa currently available (I.J. at 2-3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that a continuance was not warranted. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6 (placing the decision to grant or deny a continuance within the discretion of the Immigration Judge if good cause is shown); see also Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987). As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent did not establish good cause for a continuance to apply for this relief (I.J. at 2-3).
 
While this Board has announced numerous factors that should be considered when considering whether removal proceedings should be continued to await a final decision regarding the merits of a pending immigrant visa petition, “the focus of the inquiry is the apparent ultimate likelihood of success on the adjustment application.” Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 790 (BIA 2009). At the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent did not have a pending visa petition, and the Department of Homeland Security opposed the motion (I.J. at 2). The respondent already had two unsuccessful visa petitions from the same spouse petitioner (I.J. at 2). We conclude that, in light of the highly speculative nature of the outcome of a third visa petition from the same spouse, the respondent had not sufficiently demonstrated an apparently ultimate likelihood of success on the adjustment application to warrant a continuance. See Matter of Hashmi, supra, at 790.
 
*2 The respondent’s arguments on appeal are not persuasive, and do not address the complete lack of any basis to grant a continuance to apply for adjustment of status. See Respondent’s Brief. The respondent’s main argument is that the Immigration Judge should not have denied his motion to continue because he received ineffective assistance from the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Judge. The respondent alleges that his prior counsel failed to adequately prepare for the hearing and show good cause for a continuance. See Respondent’s Brief at *unnumbered* p. 2-3. However, the respondent has yet to demonstrate compliance with the criteria we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of prior counsel. Specifically, the respondent has submitted no proof that former counsel has been made aware of the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel before the Board and that he has filed a complaint with the state bar. The respondent’s photocopies of letters to former counsel and the state bar are not proof of mailing or filing.
 
Further, even if the respondent had complied procedurally with Lozada, he has not established that former counsel’s action or inaction caused him prejudice in these proceedings. See Matter of Assad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2002) (alien did not establish that this former counsel’s failure to file a timely appeal constituted sufficient prejudice to warrant consideration of his late appeal on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640 (successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires a showing that the respondent was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance). Specifically, since the Immigration Judge’s decision nearly two years ago and during the pendency of this appeal, the respondent has not submitted an application for relief, or shown that he has an approved or pending visa petition.1 As the respondent has not presently established prima facie eligibility for any relief, the alleged ineffective assistance has not been shown to have potentially affected the outcome of the respondent’s case. Thus, the respondent has not established a basis to remand his case on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Consequently, the respondent has further failed to show prejudice that resulted from the continuance denial. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). Thus, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance and pretermission of the respondent’s application for adjustment of status.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
*3 FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: BALKAR SINGH
File: AXXX XX7 641 - Buffalo, New York
February 11, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Elizabeth J. Dobosiewicz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michele Henriques
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s October 3, 2014, written decision which denied his motion to rescind his in absentia removal order. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has requested summary affirmance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues involving questions of law, judgment and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of her own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). In determining whether exceptional circumstances exist to excuse an alien’s failure to appear, the “totality of circumstances” pertaining to the alien’s case must be considered. Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, 509 (BIA 1996).
 
The respondent received personal service of the Notice to Appear on September 14, 2011, which bears his signature (Exh. 1). On December 8, 2011, the Immigration Judge informed him of the consequences for failure to appear through an interpreter, and he indicated that he understood the consequences (I.J. at 5). On October 26, 2012, the respondent, through counsel, requested voluntary departure and a hearing on voluntary departure was scheduled for May 5, 2014 (I.J. at 2). The respondent was present at the hearing and indicated through an interpreter that he understood that his next hearing was scheduled for May 5, 2014 (Id.).
 
*2 Following a hearing conducted in absentia on May 5, 2014, at which the respondent failed to appear and the DHS presented evidence, an Immigration Judge found him subject to removal as charged, and ordered him removed from the United States. See generally section 240 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. His counsel appeared and was unable to explain the respondent’s absence (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge granted her request to withdraw as counsel (I.J. at 2-3).
 
On September 12, 2014, the respondent filed a pro se motion to rescind his in absentia removal order. He alleged without elaboration that he did not appear on May 5, 2014, because his attorney allegedly informed him that his hearing was on May 6, 2014. The respondent did not specify when his attorney told him the incorrect hearing date. He claimed that his attorney’s allegedly informing him of the incorrect hearing date, without more, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel amounting to exceptional circumstances, which should excuse his failure to appear. The respondent conceded that he indicated at the October 26, 2012, hearing that he understood that his next hearing date was on May 5, 2014. Furthermore, he alleged without elaboration that he was eligible for asylum although he did not attach an asylum application. Finally, the respondent attached a copy of an Immigration Practitioner Complaint Form (Form EOIR-44) dated September 12, 2014, which he claimed to have filed with the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). The DHS filed a response in opposition to the motion to reopen.
 
On October 3, 2014, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to rescind the in absentia removal order because the respondent had been personally informed on October 26, 2012, that his next hearing was on May 5, 2014, he indicated that he understood the next hearing date, and he had not established exceptional circumstances to excuse his failure to appear (I.J. at 5). In addition, the Immigration Judge held that the respondent had not established that he merited reopening for the purpose of applying for asylum inasmuch as the record indicated that he had entered the United States prior to 2000, and he had not alleged or established the existence of any changed country conditions to excuse his applying for asylum more than 1 year after his entry date (Exh. 2) (I.J. at 5-6). Finally, he had not attached an asylum application to his motion (I.J. at 6).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel to excuse his failure to appear. He has not established that his absence at the scheduled hearing was the result of lack of notice because, in addition to the fact that the attorney received notice, he conceded that he understood that his hearing was scheduled for May 5, 2014, when he personally appeared for the hearing on October 26, 2012. See also Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996) (alien seeking to reopen in absentia proceedings based upon her unsuccessful communications with attorney about hearing date did not establish exceptional circumstances where she failed to satisfy all of requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
*3 To the extent that the respondent has claimed that his attorney purportedly told him an incorrect hearing date, this allegation, without more, does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, especially in light of the respondent’s concession that he knew his hearing was scheduled for May 5, 2014. In addition, he has not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) to establish ineffective assistance of counsel because he has not provided any proof that he informed his prior attorney about her alleged prior misconduct, and he has not filed a state bar complaint. His claim that he is unable to comply with Matter of Lozada, supra, because he is detained, without additional explanation or elaboration, is unavailing.1
 
Finally, the respondent alleges for the first time on appeal that he is eligible for reopening because he purportedly did not receive oral warnings of the consequences for failure to appear at the October 26, 2012, hearing. However, he did not raise this allegation of error in his motion, and the Board does not review issues raised for the first time on appeal. See, e.g., Matter of Jimenez, 21 I&N Dec. 567, 570 n.2 (BIA 1996) (issues not raised before Immigration Judge are not properly before Board on appeal); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629, 638 (BIA 2003). In any event, his reliance on Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998), and section 242B of the Act, in support of this argument is misplaced in part because he is removal proceedings and not deportation proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

As part of a Motion To Stay Removal filed on February 6, 2015, the respondent claims he has filed a state bar complaint. However, the Board is an appellate body and we generally do not consider evidence filed on appeal. Also, the respondent has not shown that this complaint could not have been submitted earlier in the proceedings. Thus, we do not consider the additional evidence. In any event, the attorney apparently has not had the opportunity to respond given the late submission. The Motion To Stay Removal is moot given our disposition on the merits.

IN RE: ADRIAN DE ALBA CASTREJON
File: AXXX XX9 607 - Seattle, WA
February 11, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stephen Robbins, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated August 29, 2014, denying his motion to reopen. While we accept the respondent’s appeal brief, we will dismiss his appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by any alleged deficiencies in his prior attorney’s handling of this case. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988) (holding that, in order to warrant reopening on account of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance); see also Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that prejudice results when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings).
 
Here, the respondent contends that his former counsel did not advise him of the ability to pursue an Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal (Form I-589). However, as recognized by the Immigration Judge, the Form I-589 which the respondent offered in support of his motion to reopen provided no substantive information about his claim (I.J. at 2). While the respondent did check the box on page 5 of his proposed Form I-589, to indicate that he is seeking asylum and withholding of removal on account of his membership in a particular social group, he has not provided the exact delineation of any particular social group to which he claims to belong. See Matter of A-T-, 25 I&N Dec. 4 (BIA 2009). On appeal, the respondent has referred to being handicapped as a result of a workplace injury (Respondent’s Br. at 3). However, he not meaningfully argued that such status amount to membership in a particular social group cognizable under the Act. See Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227 (BIA 2014). He has also not offered any evidence that handicapped individuals are persecuted in Mexico. While the respondent does refer to a cousin that was killed in Mexico, he does not claim that his cousin was also handicapped or otherwise similarly situated. A generalized fear of crime and violence in Mexico does not amount to a basis to grant the respondent asylum or withholding of removal as he must demonstrate that a protected ground is a “central reason” for the claimed harm. See Matter of C-T-L-, 25 I&N Dec. 341, 347 (BIA 2010); Matter of J-B-N- & S-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 208 (BIA 2007).
 
*2 The respondent has also not meaningfully articulated a basis upon which he would warrant protection under the Convention Against Torture. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c)(2), 1208.18(a); Matter of J-F-F-, 23 I&N Dec. 912 (A.G. 2006).
 
For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the respondent has not demonstrated the requisite prejudice needed to reopen these proceedings on account of ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Reopening; stay
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration December 20, 2012, decision denying her timely motion to reopen.1 The respondent’s motion was filed on December 6, 2012, after the Immigration Judge granted her pre-conclusion voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), in a decision dated September 7, 2012. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b) (generally setting a 90-day deadline for filing motions to reopen). The respondent then filed this timely appeal. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). Her appeal will be sustained, proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The following facts and procedural history are not in dispute. The respondent entered the United States on March 26, 1985, as a non-immigrant visitor but remained longer than authorized (Exhs. 1A, 4:1). On June 14, 2001, she pled guilty to and was convicted of injury to a child, a third degree felony (Exh. 3). She is the beneficiary of an approved Alien Relative Petition (Form I-130) filed on her behalf by her United States citizen son and approved by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on June 1, 2011 (Exh. 4:3). In light of the respondent’s conviction and her approved visa petition as an immediate relative, she sought adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), in conjunction with a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), before the Immigration Judge (Exh. 4).2
 
*2 At her final hearing, scheduled before the Immigration Judge on September 7, 2012, the respondent was advised that her adjustment application would be denied (I.J. at 1).3 Thereafter, she consulted with her then-counsel off the record before withdrawing her applications for adjustment and a 212(h) waiver and accepting pre-conclusion voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Act (I.J. at 1).
 
On December 6, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reopen through new counsel in which she maintains that her previous attorney provided ineffective assistance (Resp. Motion to Reopen at 3-7; Tabs E, I-J). Specifically, she maintains that her prior attorney performed deficiently because he did not advise her that she needed to obtain an updated medical examination prior to her final hearing (Resp. Motion to Reopen at 6; Tab E). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.102(o), (q), (r) (requiring a practitioner to provide competent representation, to act with reasonable promptness and diligence in representing the respondent before the Immigration Court, and to maintain appropriate communication with the respondent during the course of such representation). In addition, the respondent maintains that when issues regarding the medical examination were raised at her final hearing, her former attorney did not advise her about the problem but instead told her that the Immigration Judge was denying her applications because of her criminal conviction (Resp. Motion to Reopen at 3, 6; Tab E). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.102(r)(1)-(2) (requiring counsel to promptly inform the respondent about any decision or circumstance requiring the respondent’s informed consent, consult with the respondent regarding such consent, and consult with the respondent about the means by which the respondent’s objectives may be accomplished). The respondent also maintains that her attorney performed deficiently because he did not request a continuance in allowing her to remedy the alleged defect in her application (Resp. Motion to Reopen at 6; Tab E). Instead, she asserts that her attorney misled her when advising her about her options by telling her the Immigration Judge could immediately arrest her if she did not agree to withdraw her applications for relief and accept voluntary departure and indicating to her that she did not have other options (Resp. Motion to Reopen at 3, 7; Tab E). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.102(p) (requiring the practitioner to abide by the respondent’s decisions concerning the respondent’s objectives after reasonably consulting with the respondent in advising her of such options); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.102(r)(2).
 
*3 On December 20, 2012, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, finding the record does not contain sufficient evidence establishing that the respondent’s former attorney performed deficiently when counseling the respondent with respect to her options in these proceedings (I.J. at 1). Specifically, he concluded that the respondent’s decision to accept voluntary departure was knowing and voluntary because (1) her counsel confirmed on the record that he spoke with the respondent regarding her options, (2) the Immigration Judge confirmed this in questioning the respondent on the record, and (3) the respondent signed the Immigration Judge’s order granting pre-conclusion voluntary departure and advising the respondent of her rights and responsibilities thereunder (I.J. at 1). In addition, the Immigration Judge concluded that, notwithstanding any deficiencies in prior counsel’s performance, the respondent did not establish that she would have prevailed on her adjustment and waiver applications if she had a hearing on the merits (I.J. at 1-2).
 
At the outset, we note that the Immigration Judge did not conclude that the respondent’s motion to reopen does not comply with the procedural requirements for motions based on ineffective assistance as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (Resp. Motion to Reopen at Tabs E, I-J). See id. at 639 (explaining that generally a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance should generally be supported by (1) an affidavit from the aggrieved party, (2) evidence that the former attorney has been advised of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond, along with any response offered, and (3) evidence that appropriate disciplinary authorities have been notified or, if not, the reason such notification is not being pursued); see also Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 2014) (confirming the applicability of these procedural requirements within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, wherein this case arises).
 
Although the Immigration Judge concluded that the record contains insufficient evidence of misconduct by the respondent’s former attorney, in part, because the Immigration Judge spoke to the respondent on the record and confirmed her willingness to withdraw her applications for relief and accept voluntary departure, we note that the Immigration Judge’s decision does not consider all of the allegations of misconduct made by the respondent (I.J. at 1; Resp. Motion to Reopen at 3, 6, Tabs E, I-J; Resp. Brief at 3-10). Specifically, the respondent maintains that her attorney told her that (1) she did not have any other options, including an opportunity to appeal; and (2) the Immigration Judge could immediately arrest her if she declined to accept voluntary departure, such that she did not knowingly and voluntarily accept this grant of relief (Resp. Motion to Reopen at 3, 6, Tabs E, I-J; Resp. Brief at 3-4). While we agree with the Immigration Judge that we will generally bind a respondent to the tactical decisions she makes with her counsel, she is not bound by these decisions to the extent she makes a showing of egregious circumstances (I.J. at 1). See Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938, 942 (BIA 1995); Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986); see also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 166-67 (5th Cir. 2006).
 
*4 Here, we conclude that such egregious circumstances have been demonstrated where the respondent claims in her unrebutted affidavit that her attorney (1) did not tell her an updated medical was required, (2) did not advise her at her hearing that her adjustment application was incomplete, and thus subject to denial, based on the date of the medical examination, (3) did not request a continuance to obtain an updated medical examination, (4) did not advise the respondent that she could appeal any adverse decision issued by the Immigration Judge, and (5) advised the respondent that her only option was to accept voluntary departure because her failure to do so would result in her arrest by the Immigration Judge (Resp. Motion to Reopen at 3, 6, Tabs E, I-J; Resp. Brief at 3-10).
 
Moreover, we agree with the respondent that her proceedings were rendered fundamentally unfair by her attorney’s conduct, as his failure to advise her of the need for an updated medical examination and failure to request a continuance to remedy the defect led directly to a determination that she could not prevail on the adjustment application at her final hearing before the Immigration Judge (Resp. Brief at 9-10; I.J. at 1). See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998) (requiring ineffective assistant to be so egregious as to render the hearing unfair); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640; see also Ogbemudia v. INS, 988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir. 1993) (requiring an alien to demonstrate “substantial prejudice” in order to establish that a hearing is fundamentally unfair). While we express no opinion as to the respondent’s ultimate statutory and discretionary eligibility for adjustment of status with a waiver of inadmissibility, we conclude that the record does not contain sufficient evidence to establish that the respondent knowingly and voluntarily withdrew her applications for relief and we have identified no apparent, statutory impediments to her ability to proceed with these previously filed applications. See Anwar v. INS, 116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir. 1997); Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994) (requiring an alien to establish prima facie eligibility for relief from removal to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
Accordingly, in light of the respondent’s timely motion, supported by her unrebutted affidavit asserting that her prior attorney performed deficiently and deceptively in securing her consent to withdraw her applications for relief and to accept pre-conclusion voluntary departure, we conclude that reopening of this matter is appropriate. Therefore, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be granted and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge to allow the respondent to pursue her previously withdrawn applications.
 
*5 In light of our disposition of this matter, we decline to address the respondent’s motion for a stay as moot. Upon remand, the parties will have an opportunity to supplement the record with any documentation or testimony they may choose to present regarding the respondent’s statutory and discretionary eligibility for adjustment of status sought in conjunction with her waiver of inadmissibility.
 
Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained and her motion to reopen, granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion for a stay is denied as moot.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, including, but not limited to, proceedings allowing the respondent to pursue her applications for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act and a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act.

Because the Immigration Judge served his decision on the parties by mail on December 28, 2012, the respondent’s January 25, 2013, Notice of Appeal is timely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(c) (setting a 30-day deadline for filing a Notice of Appeal beginning from the date that the Immigration Judge’s decision is served by mail).

Some of the facts recited in this order were not formally found by the Immigration Judge but may be administratively noticed based on the record evidence. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (limiting our appellate fact-finding authority to “taking administrative notice of commonly known facts such as the contents of official documents”); Matter of S-H-, supra, at 465-66.

Specifically, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) moved to pretermit the respondent’s adjustment application due to a purportedly out-of-date medical examination, at which point the respondent’s former counsel agreed to discuss pre-conclusion voluntary departure with the respondent (I.J. at 1). We need not ultimately address whether the medical exam was expired, thus forming a valid basis for pretermitting the respondent’s adjustment application. However, we note that 8 C.F.R. §§ 245.5 and 1245.5 indicate that the exam must be completed no more than a year prior to the filing of the adjustment application, and the relevant statute and regulations do not further define whether the medical expires during the pendency of an adjustment application if the application remains under review for a period of more than a year from the date that the examination was completed. However, at the time that the Immigration Judge found the respondent statutorily ineligible to adjust her status due to the expiration of her medical examination USCIS maintained a policy in which the agency considered a medical examination to remain unexpired during the pendency of such application in the absence of any noted Class A or B medical condition. See, e.g., Policy Memorandum, Extension of Validity of Medical Certifications on Form I-693 (December 29, 2011) (valid until January 1, 2013).

IN RE: KHURRAM KHAN

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Courtney A. Chua, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Patrick E. McClintock
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The motion to reopen is untimely. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on February 26, 2003, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. With certain exceptions, a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent filed his motion to reopen and request for a stay of removal on November 14, 2014, over 11 years after the Board’s final order. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The motion and stay will be denied.
 
To the extent that the respondent is continuing to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not complied with any of the Lozada1 procedural requirements. See Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87, 94-95 (BIA 2007) (finding that the alien satisfied the concerns underlying the Lozada requirements by complying with the first two steps). Further, the respondent has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s actions or inactions. See Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605, 609 (5th Cir. 2006) (rejecting claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on failure to pursue a discretionary waiver of relief from removal); Assaad v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 471, 476 (5th Cir. 2004) (“because Assaad’s attorney’s allegedly deficient performance merely restricted his chances of receiving a discretionary waiver of his removability, we conclude that he has not alleged a violation of his due process rights”); see also Altamiro-Lopez v. Gonzales, 435 F.3d 547, 550 (5th Cir. 2006) (the denial for discretionary relief does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest). Here, the respondent has not sufficiently established prima facie eligibility for relief. Thus, the respondent has not shown due diligence or prejudice to warrant equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel
 
To the extent that the respondent is also seeking to apply for asylum or withholding of removal based on changed circumstances or conditions arising in Pakistan, he has not submitted any evidence in support of his claim nor has he articulated a basis for relief. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Moreover, the respondent has not submitted a new asylum application along with his motion as required by regulation. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). As such, we are not persuaded that the respondent’s alleged fear of harm in Pakistan is adequately supported. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104 (1988) (a motion to reopen may be denied if alien does not establish prima facie case for the relief sought); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (to prevail on a motion to reopen an alien must establish that “the new evidence offered would likely change the result in the case”).
 
*2 Finally, the respondent’s motion does not demonstrate an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretionary authority to reopen his proceedings sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “the power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). While the respondent alleges that he will seek adjustment of status based on a yet to be filed immediate relative visa petition, he is an arriving alien and thus, USCIS has sole jurisdiction over any future application for adjustment of status. Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 107 (BIA 2009). Accordingly, the motion and stay will be denied.2
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Matter of Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), requires a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim be accompanied by: “(1) an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement with former counsel concerning what action would be taken and what counsel did or did not represent in this regard; (2) proof that the alien notified former counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance and allowed counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) if a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities is claimed, a statement as to whether the alien filed a complaint with any disciplinary authority regarding counsel’s conduct and, if a complaint was not filed, an explanation for not doing so.”).

Any request for prosecutorial discretion must be addressed to the DHS. The Board does not have the authority to grant relief from removal solely on equitable or humanitarian grounds. See Matter of Silva-Rodriguez, 20 I&N Dec. 448 (BIA 1992); Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734, 742 (BIA 1988).

IN RE: JOSE WILMER MEMBRENO-DELAO A.K.A WILBER DELGO MEMBRENO A.K.A. JOSE MEMBRENO A.K.A. JOSE WUILMER MEMBRENO
File: AXXX XX3 797 - Los Angeles, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lorena Marquez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before us on October 31, 2014, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision, affirming the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent had not demonstrated good cause for a continuance to pursue prosecutorial discretion from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and that the respondent did not warrant preconclusion voluntary departure as a matter of discretion. The DHS has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent requests reconsideration of our prior decision because he argues that the decision is based on the mistaken conclusion that he was convicted of two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol, one in 2010 and another in 2011, when, in fact, he was only charged with driving under the influence in 2010, but never convicted (Resp. Mot. at 2-3; Exhs. A-B). The respondent argues that his prior counsel was ineffective in that he did not inform the court that the respondent was only convicted one time (Resp. Mot. at 2). In support of this argument, the respondent has submitted evidence for the first time which demonstrates that his 2010 charge for driving under the influence was dismissed (Resp. Exh. A at 5). Accordingly, the motion is also in the nature of a motion to reopen.
 
We see no reason to reconsider our prior decision or reopen proceedings in light of the new evidence presented. First, the respondent has not established that the evidence, which was available at the time of the previous hearing, was not submitted as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel. He has neither substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), nor is ineffective assistance plain from the administrative record. See Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999) (explaining that “[t]o establish ineffective assistance of counsel in a motion to reopen, an alien must” meet Lozada’s criteria); see Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 596-99 (9th Cir. 2004) (explaining that strict compliance with Matter of Lozada may not be required where ineffective assistance of counsel is plain from the administrative record).
 
Even if the respondent was to establish that his counsel was neglectful in failing to file evidence of his prior convictions, we do not conclude that “the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999). While it does appear that the respondent was in fact not convicted of driving under the influence in 2010, the evidence indicates that he was arrested for such an offense, made to complete alcohol awareness classes, and that his alcohol use was limited as a condition of his probation (Exh. A). That arrest, and subsequent probation, are still relevant to the discretionary determination on his application for relief, even if it did not result in a conviction. See e.g. Matter of Grijalva, 19 I&N Dec. 713, 722 (BIA 1988) (advising that in cases involving discretionary relief, all relevant factors concerning criminal history, including arrests not resulting in a conviction, and information contained in police reports should be considered). The particularly troubling aspect of this respondent’s misconduct was his 2011 driving under the influence conviction shortly after he had attended alcohol awareness classes in 2010. As emphasized by the Immigration Judge, the respondent apparently “learned nothing from those classes that he took in 2010” because he was “well aware of the consequences of driving under the influence of alcohol, but chose to get in a car again and put the lives of other people at risk by driving under the influence of alcohol.”
 
*2 As such, we conclude that the respondent was not prejudiced by counsel’s actions and that reopening for further consideration of the respondent’s application for pre-conclusion voluntary departure is not warranted. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (explaining that the party who seeks to reopen proceedings to pursue a discretionary grant of relief from removal bears a “heavy burden” of demonstrating the new evidence presented would likely change the result in the case).
 
Finally, we are unpersuaded by the respondent’s argument that his proceedings should be reopened to allow him to pursue his Form I-589, submitted for the first time with this motion, because of the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel (Resp. Br. at 2). As explained above, the respondent has not substantially complied with Matter of Lozada in making his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and nothing in the record suggests that respondent’s counsel was ineffective in not pursuing this form of relief on the respondent’s behalf previously. See Ortiz v. INS, supra, at 1153; Reyes v. Ashcroft, supra, at 596-99. The respondent’s right to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture was fully explained to him at his hearing and he was given two continuances for the purpose of completing those applications (Resp. Mot. at 3; Exh. C; Tr. at 9-10, 14, 17). Accordingly, we see no reason to remand proceedings to allow the respondent to pursue that form of relief. Therefore, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on August 22, 2014, at which time the respondent’s appeal of the decision of the Immigration Judge of May 17, 2013, was dismissed. That decision pretermitted the respondent’s application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). On November 14, 2014, the respondent filed the timely motion to reopen now before the Board alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The Board may in some cases grant a motion to reopen in order to remedy an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See generally Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-640 (BIA 1988). Nonetheless, in this matter, the respondent has failed to show that but for the assistance rendered, he would have been entitled to relief from removal. In particular, the respondent contends that former counsel erred in conceding that he, the respondent, was removable as charged. However, the respondent has failed to provide to former counsel, and has continued to fail to provide to the Board, appropriate evidence to establish lawful entry. Absent such evidence, the respondent has failed to show the prejudice requisite to establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 (5th Cir. 2001). To the extent that the respondent seeks humanitarian relief to enable him to remain in the United States, such relief is to be pursued with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). Likewise, any request for relief from removal in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion must also be made to the DHS. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is, hereby, denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul W. Shonk, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathan Goulding
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of India who entered the United States as a conditional permanent resident based on a marriage to a United States citizen. His status was terminated by USCIS, the Immigration Judge denied his good faith waiver, sustained the charge of marriage fraud, and the Board dismissed his appeal. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent also seeks a remand based on his marriage to another United States citizen and a pending I-130 visa petition. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the granting of the motion. The motion is denied.
 
A motion to reopen “shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing . . . .” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The movant must also establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought, INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 319 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988), and satisfy the “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
The respondent does not address the requirement that the evidence must not be previously available. Rather, the respondent contends that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel because he did not also pursue an extreme hardship waiver based on his alleged persecution in India, which continued against his family even after he moved to the United States, or adequately prepare him, or his witnesses, for trial (Motion, Exh. A). Many years after the fact, the respondent also argues that his mother should not have been called as a witness because she had dementia. We find no basis to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Contrary to the respondent’s assertions, the record indicates that Mr. Thomas’s representation was thorough and that he was an effective advocate on behalf of the respondent during this proceeding. Mr. Thomas filed a response to the complaint which confirms this view (Notice of Filing Counsel’s Response to Bar Complaint, filed 1/7/15). A review of the record indicates that the respondent had at least three different attorneys in this proceeding before Mr. Thomas entered his appearance (EOIR-28 filed 3/6/08 for Karen Denise Bradley; I.J. Order issued 3/27/08 substituting Candie Clement; I.J. Order issued 4/1/08 substituting David Wenger; I.J. Order issued 2/8/12 substituting Mark Jacob Thomas).
 
*2 An attorney prior to Mr. Thomas prepared and pursued the I-751 waiver with USCIS. It is well-settled that where USCIS has denied a waiver, the respondent may not pursue an alternative waiver under section 216(c)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4) during proceedings. See Matter of Anderson, 20 I&N Dec. 888 (BIA 1994). Further, the respondent has not presented sufficient evidence of changed circumstances occurring after the filing of the original waiver so that Mr. Thomas would have had notice and been able to seek a continuance. Id.
 
As to the question of extreme hardship, even if Mr. Thomas had pursued an untimely waiver and argued that the alleged extreme hardship arose during the requisite two year period, we do not find that the respondent’s current claims are credible (Motion, Exhs. F and G). The respondent and his father allege that due to the persecution, the respondent was in hiding at a relative’s home prior to leaving India, and his father asserts that he was forced to immigrate soon after due to the continued persecution (Motion, Exh. F at p. 045; Exh. G at p. 048). However, the documents and affidavits filed with USCIS in 2001 within several years after the last incidents of alleged harm make no mention of persecution, harm, hiding, or fear of residing in India.
 
Rather, in his 2001 filings with USCIS (long before Mr. Thomas represented him), the respondent submitted an affidavit under oath that described his courtship in India. He attested to their initial meeting in his family home in India, their visits with her children, their visits and “shopping all over the city” together, looking around for a wedding hall, their ceremony and honeymoon, visits with relatives, his playing with her children, residing at his parents’ house with his new wife, driving to the airport and waiting there until her plane took off, and obtaining his visa and coming to the United States (I.J. Dec. at 3; Exh. 2, Tab B at pp. 61-63). The respondent’s father also submitted a prior affidavit and did not mention the alleged fears or the fact that his son was in hiding (Exh. 2, Tab B at pp. 64-66), which they now claim over 13 years later.
 
Given the inconsistencies between the affidavits filed with the motion long after the alleged events occurred and the affidavits already contained in the record, we find that the respondent’s current claims are not credible. Further, given the representations made by the respondent and his father under penalty of perjury in the 2001 filing with USCIS, there was no reason for Mr. Thomas to inquire further or explore an untimely extreme hardship waiver. Accordingly, we do not find that Mr. Thomas provided ineffective assistance of counsel to the respondent such that proceedings should be reopened and remanded. Nor has the respondent shown the requisite prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
*3 The respondent has a pending I-130 based on his marriage to another United States citizen, but he is not prima face eligible to adjust his status (I.J. Dec. at pp. 27-28 sustaining marriage fraud charge of removability). Section 204(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c). Further, the respondent filed a document indicating that his conditional permanent resident status has somehow been reinstated. See Notice of Filing dated 11/10/14, Tab A). Therefore, the respondent is not eligible to adjust his status under section 245. Section 245(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(d). The following order shall be issued.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hardeep Rai, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on July 28, 2014. On November 25, 2014, the respondent filed the motion to reopen now before the Board alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsels. The respondent has complied, in part, with the process requisite to asserting such a claim. See generally Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-640 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent has provided detailed affidavits setting forth the bases for his assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel; evidence of fee arrangements and payments both in the United States and abroad to former counsels; evidence of representation by former counsels; bar complaints filed against one of the attorneys in two different jurisdictions, California and Texas; adverse information from the press relating to an individual associated with former counsel who also played a part in the representation of the respondent; and, a press report naming the individual who the respondent met at the detention center who referred him to former counsel. The respondent paid substantial fees to an attorney, referred to him by an individual at the Eloy detention facility, who, with the assistance of other attorneys, appeared in proceedings on behalf of the respondent, but ultimately failed to file an application for relief by the deadline set resulting in the respondent’s inability to seek the relief of asylum in the United States.
 
The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. We accept the respondent’s detailed affidavit, which we accept as true for purposes of this motion (see Najmabadi v. Holder, 597 F.3d 983, 994 (9th Cir. 2010)). Given the circumstances detailed in the respondent’s affidavit, we find that an adequate showing of due diligence has been made, that equitable tolling is appropriate and that reopening should be granted. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672 (9th Cir. 2011). On remand, the respondent shall have the opportunity to apply for any relief for which he may be eligible.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen is granted and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

January 13, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Amos W. Carty, Jr., Esquire
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Anguilla, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated June 10, 2013, ordering his removal from the United States.2 We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent is inadmissible to the United States under the provisions of section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(7)(A)(i)(I), because he is an immigrant who, at the time of his application for admission, did not possess a valid entry document (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). The respondent arrived in the United States on July 20, 2012, after having been absent for more than 1 year (Exh. 1; Tr. at 15). While, according to the Record of Deportable / Inadmissible Alien (Form I-213), the respondent did present a Lawful Permanent Resident Card (Form I-551) upon his application for admission to this country, a Form I-551 is sufficient to allow for an alien’s admission to the United States only if the alien “if seeking readmission after a temporary absence of less than 1 year.”3 8 C.F.R. § 211.1(a)(2).
 
The Immigration Judge advised the respondent that he could seek a waiver of the requirement that he hold a valid entry document by filing an Application for Waiver of Passport and/or Visa (Form I-193) (Tr. at 11). See section 211(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(b). The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent to file everything, i.e., the Form I-193, a witness list, and supporting documents, with the Immigration Court no later than June 3, 2013, and, if the documents were not timely filed, she would consider the form to be abandoned (Tr. at 20). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.31(a), (c); Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992). The respondent contends that he attempted to fax his Form I-I93 to the Immigration Court on June 3, 2013. Attempting to file a Form I-193 by fax was improper because, aside from the Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative before the Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28), “[a]ll other filings must be submitted as paper submissions to the Immigration Court.”4 Immigration Court Practice Manual, § 3.1(a)(viii) at 34 (June 10, 2013), http:// www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/OCIJPracManual/Practice_Manual_review.pdf. Accordingly, as the respondent has not established that he timely complied and properly complied with the Immigration Judge’s filing deadline, the Immigration Judge properly deemed his opportunity to file a Form I-193 to be abandoned and ordered his removal from the United States to Anguilla.
 
*2 Finally, the respondent has presented numerous documents on appeal. However, the Board does not consider evidence first provided on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv); Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984) (“The Board is an appellate body whose function is to review, not to create, a record.”). Additionally, we decline to remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge to consider the evidence in the first instance as such evidence has not been shown to affect the outcome of this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Even though the respondent has attached several letters of support to his appeal brief, as discussed above, he is inadmissible under the provisions of section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Act and has abandoned his opportunity to file a Form I-193.
 
For the reasons set forth above, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge in this matter were completed at a Department of Homeland Security office in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands (see OPPM No. 04-06). The Immigration Judge conducted the hearings there remotely from the Immigration Court in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, via video teleconference pursuant to section 240(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act.

2

The respondent, through counsel, claims that, on June 5, 2013, he mailed a Form I-193 to the Immigration Court and, on June 14, 2013, he filed a motion to reconsider. However, neither of those filing are currently present in the record of proceedings.

3

There are exceptions to the rule that a Form I-551, in itself, is sufficient to allow for an alien’s the admission to the United States only if the alien is seeking readmission after a temporary absence of less than 1 year. For example, in certain circumstances, an alien seeking readmission after a temporary absence of more than 1 year may present a Form I-551 if he is seeking readmission after any temporary absence connected with his or her duties as a crewman or he is an employee of the United States government. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 211.1(a)(2), (5), (6), (7). However, the respondent does not meaningfully argue that he is entitled to an exception to this rule.

4

The respondent does not argue that his attorney provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel by attempting to file his Form I-193 by fax. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: NORMAN JIMINEZ
File: AXXX XX3 253 - Newark, NJ
January 9, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Helen Ramirez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and will be denied. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent filed the motion more than a decade after the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal in June 2004. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion.
 
The respondent does not dispute that his motion is untimely, but urges that the time limit for motions to reopen should be equitably tolled because he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel by two prior attorneys. The respondent has substantially complied with the threshold procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for pursuing an ineffective assistance claim. To warrant equitable tolling, however, the respondent must also demonstrate due diligence in raising the claim. See Mahmood v. Gonzales, All F.3d 248 (3d Cir. 2005).
 
The respondent avers that attorneys Pasquale F. Giannetta and Marcia S. Kasdan deficiently represented the respondent. The respondent alleges that attorney-Giannetta, inter alia, did not explain or obtain the respondent’s consent to waive appeal in order to obtain the benefit of voluntary departure, failed to explain or pursue available forms of relief on the respondent’s behalf, and did not file an appellate brief on the respondent’s behalf. The respondent alleges that in 2007 he retained attorney-Kasdan who also failed to regularly communicate with the respondent and did not pursue adjustment of status on the respondent’s behalf in connection with a labor certification approval and Form I-140 approval in April 2009.
 
The respondent should have been aware of attorney-Giannetta’s alleged deficient performance when we issued our decision in 2004. And he should have known of attorney-Kasdan’s inadequate representation - at the very latest - when she repeatedly refused to meet with him regarding his employment-related visa petition (Form I-140), which the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services approved in April 2009. The respondent has not adequately explained why he waited more than a decade to raise ineffective assistance against attorney-Giannetta, and more than 5 years for his claim against attorney-Kasdan. Under the circumstances, the respondent has not established the requisite due diligence to raise ineffective assistance in order to equitably toll the 90-day time limitation on motions to reopen.
 
While the respondent has submitted evidence that the New Jersey licensing authority has sanctioned attorney-Giannetta and attorney-Kasdan, he does not allege that counsels’ sanctions arose from deficient performance in these proceedings.
 
*2 Additionally, the respondent has not set forth “exceptional circumstances” that would warrant the exercise of our sua sponte authority to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “““[a]s a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). The respondent requests reopening so that he may seek adjustment of status based upon a recently-approved visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife. But becoming eligible for relief from removal, such as adjustment of status, after a final administrative order has been entered is common and does not, in itself, constitute an exceptional circumstance warranting consideration of an untimely motion to reopen. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Yousof W. Nesari, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the October 6, 2014, decision of the Immigration Judge denying his motion to reconsider the denial of an August 4, 2014, motion to reopen proceedings in which he had been ordered removed on May 8, 2012, In his 2012 decision, the Immigration Judge also granted his request for voluntary departure. The respondent has submitted both a “motion to reopen” and a “motion to remand” on appeal. We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment arising in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo, whereas we review findings of fact in such appeals under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The appeal will be dismissed, and the motions denied.
 
We initially affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reconsider the denial of his motion to reopen. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); 8 C.F.R. § 1002.23(b)(2); see also Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741 (4th Cir. 2006) (requiring that a respondent demonstrate at least “““substantial compliance” with the Lozada requirements); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Although the respondent’s motion to reopen was predicated on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he did not substantially comply with the requirements for reopening on such a basis. Id. As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent did not file a state bar complaint against former counsel, and did not inform counsel of the allegations of ineffectiveness and notify him that he may respond. Rather, the letter he sent to former counsel specifically stated that it was not intended for Lozada compliance (Motion, tab J, ftnt. 1).
 
We recognize that the respondent submitted a number of documents with his motion to reconsider. However, a motion to reconsider is a respondent’s opportunity to specify errors of law or fact in the previous order. It is not intended to serve as a mechanism to present new evidence, or to provide an opportunity to reiterate or expand upon arguments that have been previously raised and considered. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra; Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). As such, we find that the Immigration Judge committed no error in not addressing the evidence newly submitted with the motion to reconsider.1
 
*2 While the appeal at issue was pending, the respondent filed a “motion to reopen” on December 12, 2014, averring that former counsel provided him with ineffective assistance.2 As the respondent is seeking reopening of the Immigration Judge’s 2012 decision, the motion is untimely filed. 8 C.F.R. § 1002.23(b)(1). A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel can serve to exempt a motion from the noted deadline, as indicated supra. However, we continue to find that the respondent has not complied with the requirements for reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. To date, the respondent admittedly has not filed a state bar complaint against former counsel, despite the fact that he was informed of this deficiency in the Immigration Judge’s October 6, 2014, decision (Motion at 4). While he states that he is awaiting further instructions from the court, this vague assertion is insufficient to excuse him from compliance with this requirement.
 
This is also true of the requirement that he notify former counsel of the allegations of ineffectiveness, and inform him that he may respond. In this regard, we note that the July 22, 2014, letter sent by the respondent’s current attorney to his former counsel does not contend that the respondent informed him of any fears, experiences, or concerns forming the basis for a claim of asylum or associated relief. Rather, the letter asks why such relief was not sought, and makes factual statements in this regard. It does not allege that these concerns were ever conveyed to former counsel, and not acted upon. In addition, a letter from former counsel states that the respondent did not express any fear of return to Mexico although he was asked about the same. Counsel also reports that he was not informed that the respondent’s mother was “““completely dependent” on him, as claimed in the July 22, 2014, letter. Given these significant deficiencies, we find that the respondent has not substantially complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. As such, reopening on this basis is not warranted.
 
As indicated above, the respondent has also filed a “motion to remand to Immigration Judge.” He seeks a remand as he contends that he is eligible under an expansion of the provisional unlawful presence waiver (I-601A) as directed by President Obama. In this regard he cites a directive from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Johnson regarding the noted expansion. We presume the respondent is referencing a November 20, 2014, memorandum from Secretary Johnson. Therein Secretary Johnson directed DHS to amend its regulation regarding the provisional waiver program. However, to date no such amendment has been promulgated. We are not unsympathetic to the situation faced by the respondent and his family. However, any request for a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion should be directed to the DHS as the Board is without authority to grant any such request.
 
*3 In sum, we find that the Immigration Judge correctly determined that reconsideration of his denial of the respondent’s prior motion to reopen was not appropriate. In addition, we further find that reopening based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as asserted in the respondent’s second motion to reopen is not appropriate. Finally, we find that a remand based on Secretary Johnson’s directive is also not warranted. Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motions are denied.

The respondent’s arguments that the grant of voluntary departure was void ab initio because of Immigration Judge error are in the nature of a motion to reconsider the Immigration Judge’s 2012 decision, and are untimely in that regard (Resp. Br. at 4). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). To the extent that there respondent may suggest that this forms another basis for a claim of ineffective assistance, he has not complied with the relevant requirements for such a claim in this regard. As such, we shall address these contentions no further.

2

While the respondent again avers that his voluntary departure grant may be void ab initio, also alleging that the Immigration Judge neglected to appropriately question him regarding voluntary departure, such arguments are in the nature of a motion to reconsider and have been untimely filed, as previously noted (Motion at 5-7).

File: AXXX XX9 830 - Newark, NJ

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Arturo Suarez-Silverio, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joseph Silver
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; rescission
 
*1 On October 16, 2014, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind an order of removal entered in absentia on May 4, 2001. On November 3, 2014, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen and rescind which the Department of Homeland Security opposes. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3), 1003.2(b)(4)(ii). The motion will be denied.
 
In our prior order, we noted that the respondent provided no meaningful explanation for his failure to appear at the removal hearing on May 1, 2001. The respondent now claims that his former attorney did not properly investigate the facts of his case, and the respondent asserts, for the first time, that he did not receive proper notice of the hearing.
 
Initially, we find that the respondent has not offered evidence of compliance with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel before the Board as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). See Motion Exhibits. See also Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 132 (3d Cir. 2001). Further, ineffective assistance of counsel is not apparent on the face of the record. See Lu v. Ashcroft, supra, at 134. Indeed, the respondent has not shown that he suffered prejudice as a result of a former attorney’s handling of his case. See Fadiga v. Attorney General, 488 F.3d 142, 157, 159-60 (3rd Cir. 2007); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640. Although the respondent maintains that he did not receive notice of the hearing, he has not elaborated any claim that notice of the hearing was improperly served.1
 
In sum, the respondent has not set forth a viable ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Moreover, he has neither shown that notice of the removal hearing was improper, nor provided a persuasive explanation for his failure to appear at the hearing. See sections 240(b)(5)(A), (C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(A), (C). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion, which is untimely and number-barred, will be denied. See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen and rescind is denied.

The Notice to Appear was personally served on the respondent on October 23, 2000, and the warning regarding the requirement to notify the Immigration Court of any change of address was provided to the respondent in Spanish at that time. See Exhibit 1. The record also reveals that on February 22, 2001, the Immigration Judge granted a motion to change venue which was accompanied by a form indicating that the respondent’s address had changed and that the respondent was reminded of the requirement to notify the Immigration Court of any change of address. See Exhibits 2 and 3. Based on the evidence before us, it appears that the Notice of Hearing, which was not returned as undeliverable, was properly mailed to the respondent at his address of record. See section 239(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard Bambl, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reissuance
 
*1 On December 14, 2000, the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s January 25, 1999, decision, and on October 1, 2014, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen the proceedings. The motion, which is untimely by nearly 14 years, will be denied. See sections 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The motion does not demonstrate that an exception to the filing deadline applies or that an exceptional situation is present in this case to warrant reopening sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “[t]he power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(a), (c)(3).
 
To the extent that the respondent seeks equitable tolling of the filing deadline, he has not shown that he suffered prejudice as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent asserts that former counsel did not inform him that an appeal had been filed and dismissed. He further claims that until 2014, former counsel led him to believe that his case remained pending. The respondent, however, has neither contested his removability nor identified any form of relief for which he may have been eligible either at the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision or during the period in which a timely motion to reopen could have been filed in this case. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004) (explaining that to demonstrate prejudice, the alien must show that counsel’s performance was so inadequate that it “may have affected the outcome of the proceedings”).
 
The respondent also seeks reopening for reissuance of our prior order to enable him to file a petition for judicial review. The respondent, however, has not alleged any error in the Board’s affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision nor has the respondent demonstrated that reissuance is warranted. Therefore, we decline to reissue our prior order. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992) (noting that motions to reopen immigration proceedings are disfavored, especially where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States).
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

November 6, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Eva L. Carrasco, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
 
The respondents appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 10, 2013, reissuing his decision dated November 7, 2012, denying their application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1255. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). As the respondents’ applications were filed after May 11, 2005, they are governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act. Matter of Almanza Arenas, 24 I&N Dec. 771, 774 75 (BIA 2009).
 
The Immigration Judge found the respondents, natives and citizens of the Philippines, removable as charged (I.J. Dec. dated November 7, 2012, at 1; Tr. at 15-21, 26-32, 36-37). The Immigration Judge found the respondents ineligible for adjustment of status under sections 245(a) and 245(i) because they did not (other than through no fault of their own or for technical reasons) maintain continuous lawful status as required by section 245(c)(2) of the Act (I.J. Dec. dated November 7, 2012, at 1-2).
 
We have considered the respondent’s appellate arguments. However, we adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994).
 
The Immigration Judge properly concluded that the respondents have not maintained the continuous lawful status necessary for adjustment of status. See section 245(c)(2) of the Act. The respondents’ period of lawful status terminated on the date their nonimmigrant status expired. 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(d)(1)(ii) (“lawful immigration status” refers to the immigration status of, inter alia, an alien admitted to the United States in nonimmigrant status whose initial period of admission has not expired or whose nonimmigrant status has been extended). The respondents do not dispute that they failed to maintain lawful status (Respondent’s Brief at 10).
 
The Immigration Judge properly rejected the respondents’ argument that their failure to maintain continuous lawful status since entry into the United States was through no fault of their own or for technical reasons due to their reliance on the incorrect advice of counsel before the USCIS. Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding that erroneous advice received outside and in advance of immigration proceedings did not affect fairness of proceedings and did not provide basis for reopening due to ineffective assistance of counsel). The regulations define the phrase “other than through no fault of his or her own or for technical reasons,” explicitly limiting the meaning of that phrase to four scenarios. 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(d)(2). Even assuming, arguendo, that the respondents established ineffective assistance of former counsel in providing advice on maintaining their lawful status,1 such a scenario does not fall within one of the enumerated circumstances. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(d)(2) (providing that the meaning of the phrase “(other than through no fault of his or her own or for technical reasons)” is limited to those circumstances described in the regulation). See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003); Colmenar v. INS, 210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 Thus, the respondents are not eligible for adjustment of status because they did not maintain continuous lawful status as required by section 245(c)(2) of the Act, and they cannot benefit from the exemption in section 245(k) of the Act because the period during which they were not in lawful status exceeded 180 days. See section 245(k)(2)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(k)(2)(A). We therefore affirm the Immigration Judge’s pretermission of the respondents’ applications for adjustment of status and will dismiss the appeal.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

The Immigration Judge properly rejected the respondents’ claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on their failure to comply with the procedural requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Moreover, former counsel’s legal representation before the USCIS and prior to these removal proceedings, is beyond the scope of these removal proceedings. Balam-Chuc v. Mukasey, 547 F.3d 1044, 1050-51 (9th Cir. 2008) (holding that “the Fifth Amendment simply does not apply to the preparation and filing of a petition that does not relate to the fundamental fairness of an ongoing [removal] proceeding.”); Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting that “unfortunate immigration-law advice” prior to a removal proceeding does not taint the fairness of the removal hearing itself in violation of the Fifth Amendment), amended by 404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir. 2005).

IN RE: YURY VITALYERICH PARYEV
File: AXXX XX6 987 - Chicago, IL
October 31, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sarah Elizabeth Dill, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Marc A. Jones
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent moves the Board to reopen his removal proceedings and remand the record to the Immigration Court for further proceedings regarding his application for adjustment of status. Sections 240(c)(7), 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7); 1255(a); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). We will deny the motion.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We will deny the motion to reopen because the respondent has not presented new, previously unavailable evidence that is material to his application for adjustment of status. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). In our April 7, 2014, decision, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s application in the exercise of discretion because the respondent’s criminal history outweighed the positive equities in the record. See Portillo-Rendon v. Holder, 662 F.3d 815 (7th Cir. 2011).
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen cites the equities in his favor, particularly his family ties in the United States, and is supported with a number of letters from friends and family, including a letter from the respondent’s United States citizen wife (Respondent’s Motion at 10-11 and Exhs. B-C). The respondent cites the fact that he and his wife now have twin sons, an equity that was not presented during the February 7, 2012, individual hearing below because the respondent’s wife was 1-month pregnant at the time (Respondent’s Motion at 10-11). The respondent overlooks the fact that the Board applied de novo review to the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 7, 2012, decision, and fully considered the positive equities established in the record, including the fact that the respondent became a father to twin sons during the pendency of the appeal, as well as evidence that he stopped drinking alcohol and completed a state-sponsored traffic safety program to regain his driving privileges (April 7, 2014, Order at 2). We nevertheless held that the respondent’s criminal history, which involved numerous serious driving offenses, including one during the pendency of his removal proceedings where he drove under the influence and flipped his car, outweighed the equities in his favor, and we dismissed his appeal (see April 7, 2014, Board Decision).1
 
*2 The respondent also contends that the development of political unrest and hostilities in the eastern portion of Ukraine between the Ukrainian government and those aligned with Russia is evidence of changed country conditions that supports reopening (Respondent’s Motion at 10-11 and Exhs. D-F). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The respondent’s argument is without merit because he does not seek reopening in order to pursue a claim for asylum and related relief. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247 (BIA 2007). Moreover, even if he did seek reopening to pursue asylum and related relief, we would deny the motion because generalized conditions affecting large segments of the population do not, by themselves, prove that an individual faces persecution. Raghunathan v. Holder, 604 F.3d 371, 378 (7th Cir. 2010).
 
The respondent also seeks reopening on the grounds that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Motion at 3-4, 11). The respondent has not complied with any of the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). See also Marinov v. Holder, 687 F.3d 365, 368-70 (7th Cir. 2012) (no demonstration of ineffective assistance of counsel when the respondent fails to comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639).
 
Furthermore, the respondent has not demonstrated the requisite prejudice to support such a claim because he has not presented any evidence that would change the outcome. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640 (successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires a showing that the respondent was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance). We reviewed de novo the equities in the respondent’s favor, including the equities that developed and were presented on appeal, and we decided that the respondent’s criminal history outweighed those positive equities (see April 7, 2014, Board Decision). The respondent’s motion to reopen presents no evidence that would change our calculation, and he has therefore not demonstrated any prejudice from his prior attorney’s assistance.
 
Finally, the respondent argues that his due process rights were violated in the prior proceedings (Respondent’s Motion at 4-5, 10). The respondent’s argument is without merit as he was provided a full and fair hearing in support of his application for adjustment of status, and he has made no showing that he was in any manner prevented from fully presenting his case. Hamid v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 642, 645-46 (7th Cir. 2005) (successful due process challenge requires applicant to show that he was deprived of a meaningful opportunity to be heard, and that the deprivation potentially affected the outcome). Neither the Immigration Judge nor the Board abused its discretion in deciding that the respondent’s criminal history outweigh the equities in his favor. See Marinov v. Holder, supra, at 368 (no demonstration of abuse of discretion unless Board decision is “made without rational explanation, inexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on an impermissible basis.”).
 
*3 For these reasons, we will deny the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

In this regard, the respondent’s motion is more akin to a motion to reconsider as he essentially argues that we should have weighed the equities differently, and in his favor. The respondent’s argument is without support as he has not demonstrated any material error of law or fact in our April 7, 2014, decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see Matter of 0-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Patrick T. Cullinan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopen
 
*1 ORDER:
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Brazil. On June 10, 2014, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal and extended the time within which he may voluntarily depart.1 On August 8, 2014, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Since the respondent filed his motion prior to expiration of the voluntary departure period, his grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1). The Department of Homeland Security objects to the granting of this motion.
 
The respondent seeks reopening based on a number of allegations listed by new counsel regarding the performance of former counsel. The motion shall be denied because the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent has not submitted sufficient documentary evidence indicating that he filed a state bar complaint or that former counsel was notified of the complaint and afforded the opportunity to respond to the respondent’s specific claims. Former counsel’s response would have been particularly helpful here in assessing the respondent’s allegations. Since the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, the motion is denied. The request for a stay is denied as moot.

The Immigration Judge mistakenly granted the respondent a period of voluntary departure beyond the statutorily mandated period of 60 days (Cf. I.J. Dec. at 12 with I.J. Order dated 10/9/12). Section 240B(b)(2), 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(2). Since the respondent’s voluntary departure grant has been automatically terminated by the filing of this motion, the error is moot.

IN RE: GABRIEL RAMON RAMIREZ-SOLIS
File: AXXX XX2 547 - Harlingen, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
George E. Crimarco, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 27, 2014, decision denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on September 12, 2005. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2013). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion and judgment. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s determination that, although ineffective assistance of counsel is an exceptional circumstance that may warrant reopening, he did not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent argues that compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, is impossible where the individual who gave ineffective assistance is a notario, rather than an attorney. Additionally, he asserts that proceedings should have been reopened sua sponte to allow him to apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver.
 
We concur with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion to reopen, which was filed more than 8 years after the entry of the removal order, was untimely (I.J. at 1-2). Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) (requiring that a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia order of removal based on exceptional circumstances be filed within 180 days of the entry of the removal order). The respondent has not shown that he acted diligently, such that the Immigration Judge should have equitably tolled the deadline for filing a motion to reopen.
 
Moreover, compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, is not impossible even in cases involving notarios or other individuals who provide legal advice but are not licensed attorneys. At a minimum, an aggrieved individual can submit an affidavit setting forth the details of the agreement entered into with the notario and notify the notario of the allegations against him and provide him the opportunity to respond. Further, in many states, an aggrieved individual can complain to appropriate disciplinary authorities, who may choose to sanction the individual for unauthorized practice of law. See, e.g., Consumer Pamphlet: Filing an Unlicensed Practice of Law Complaint, Florida Bar (last revised March 2014), available at http:// www.floridabar.org/TFB/TFBConsum.nsf/48e76203493b82ad852567090070c9b9/59cac57c8be11c2085256b2f006c58a5? OpenDocument; Online Complaint Form, Texas UPL Committee, http:// www.txuplc.org/complaint/Home/Index (last visited Oct. 7, 2014). In situations where a bar complaint is not possible or practical, Matter of Lozada only requires an explanation of why such a complaint was not filed. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. Thus, we see no justification for the respondent’s failure to comply with Matter of Lozada.
 
*2 In addition, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated an exceptional situation warranting reopening sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Becoming eligible for an immigration benefit years after the entry of a removal order is not an exceptional situation, and does not warrant the extraordinary equitable remedy of circumventing the statutory and regulatory restrictions on reopening.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard H. G. Cunningham, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)] - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Guatemala. On January 31, 2012, while represented by former counsel, the respondent conceded removability and did not seek relief from removal (I.J. at 1). Therefore, the Immigration Judge ordered his removal and the respondent waived appeal (I.J. at 1). The respondent now appeals the August 2, 2013, denial of a motion to reopen he filed with the Immigration Court on July 22, 2013. The Immigration Judge concluded that the motion was untimely and not subject to an exception to the time bar. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review issues of law, discretion, or judgment de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The January 31, 2012, decision ordering the respondent’s removal became final upon the waiver of appeal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39. As the respondent did not file his motion to reopen within 90 days of this date, we affirm the holding that the motion to reopen is time-barred (I.J. at 1). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Furthermore, the motion is not to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture on the basis of previously unavailable evidence of changed country conditions. The respondent thus has not shown eligibility for the exception to the time bar at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i) (I.J. at 1).
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that since the hearing, he has become eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. However, this form of relief is granted in the discretion of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) after filing of Form I-821D. Immigration Judges and the Board do not have jurisdiction to grant Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The respondent has not explained how the possibility of USCIS granting his Form I-821D qualifies him for an exception to the time bar in removal proceedings (I.J. at 1). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). Moreover, while the respondent submitted a Form I-821D with his motion, he has not presented evidence that it was filed with USCIS or shown prima facie eligibility for deferred action (I.J. at 1). Cf. Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009) (recognizing that a continuance may be warranted where an alien has demonstrated that he is the beneficiary of a pending immigrant visa petition and established a likelihood of success on an application for adjustment of status).
 
*2 Finally, the respondent states that his former attorney committed ineffective assistance by waiving his right to pursue other avenues of relief. In support of this allegation, the respondent submits a personal affidavit. The respondent has not substantially complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46-48 (2d Cir. 2005); see also Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (reaffirming the Matter of Lozada framework). Also, since the respondent has not articulated prima facie eligibility for any form of relief available in removal proceedings, he has not shown prejudice. See Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d 879, 882 (2d Cir. 1994). Therefore, the respondent has not demonstrated that tolling of the 90-day reopening deadline is appropriate on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 134, 129-30 (2d Cir. 2000).
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

** THIS IS AN UNPUBLISHED DECISION - NOT INTENDED FOR CITATION AS PRECEDENT **
 
U.S. Department of Justice
Executive Office for Immigration Review
Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: ROMUALD BOROWSKI
File: AXXX XX4 925 - Chicago, IL
October 28, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mariusz Zdyrski, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sarah E. Zeld
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Poland, has filed a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 19, 2013, denying his request for a continuance. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The factual findings of the Immigration Judge are reviewed to determine whether they are “clearly erroneous.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). All other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges, including legal and discretionary determinations and applications of law to fact, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We find no clear error in the factual findings of the Immigration Judge in this case. Upon de novo review of the questions of law, discretion, and judgment presented, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly noted that the Notice to Appear was issued in February 2009; the first hearing was held in March 2009, and the respondent appeared with counsel and was granted a continuance for attorney preparation; and continuances were granted on October 26, 2010 and August 23, 2011, so that counsel could provide proof of what efforts were being made in pursuing a U-Visa for the respondent (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 4, 9, 11, 14). On September 20, 2011, prior counsel submitted a status letter to the court regarding the potential of a U-Visa for the respondent, indicating that the agencies they had contacted no longer wished to pursue the matter or act on the respondent’s behalf (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 27; Status Letter from Y. Judd Azulay of Azulay Seiden Law Group dated September 20, 2011). On February 7, 2012 a master calendar hearing was held at which the respondent appeared with a new attorney and requested a continuance so that he could pursue a visa petition filing by the respondent’s brother and a request for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion by DHS (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 16-20). The Immigration Judge warned both the attorney and the respondent directly that this was the last continuance in the respondent’s case, and that if he did not complete applications for relief by the date of the next scheduled hearing, he would only have voluntary departure as available relief at the final hearing (Tr. at 20-21). On January 28, 2013, the Immigration Judge granted a motion to withdraw to the respondent’s new attorney (Motion to Withdraw, Jesus Ruiz-Velasco, Esquire, dated January 28, 2013). At the final master calendar hearing held on February 19, 2013, the respondent appeared pro se and requested a continuance to find another attorney (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 24). The Immigration Judge then asked several questions and determined that the respondent was not eligible for cancellation of removal, that the respondent was seeking a continuance to await his brother naturalizing and filing a visa petition on his behalf, and to await possible comprehensive immigration reform legislation, and the respondent chose not to pursue voluntary departure (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 24-26).
 
*2 The respondent failed to establish good cause for a continuance. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 355 (BIA 1983); see generally Calma v. Holder, 663 F.3d 868 (7th Cir. 2011) (I.J. consideration of speculative nature of respondent’s hopes and lengthy amount of time it would take for processing applications was appropriate); Afzal v. Holder, 559 F.3d 677 (7th Cir. 2009) (jurisdiction to review continuance denials); Hadayat v. Gonzales, 458 F.3d 659 (7th Cir. 2006) (no sibling visa immediately available); compare Subhan v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 591 (7th Cir. 2004) (continuance denial based only on length of proceedings not upheld). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that a continuance was not warranted where the respondent was not eligible for any relief on the date of the last hearing, no applications or petitions were pending or had been approved, and the hope of comprehensive immigration reform by Congress was merely speculative (I.J. at 3).
 
Contrary to the respondent’s argument on appeal, we do not find that he was denied “right to counsel,” especially where his case had been pending for 4 years, his hearings had been continued several times, and he had been represented by various attorneys at all but his last hearing, which was the result of an attorney withdrawal 3 weeks before the hearing, of which the respondent was fully aware (Resp. Br. at 3-4; I.J. at 1-3; Motion to Withdraw). See, e.g., Matter of Compean, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (aliens in removal proceedings have a statutory privilege to retain private counsel but they have no constitutional, statutory, or regulatory right to counsel). For the same reasons, we find that Matter of C-B-, 25 I&N Dec. 888 (BIA 2012), is not applicable here (Resp. Br. at 4).
 
Furthermore, the respondent has not shown any prejudice which resulted from the denial of a continuance. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987); Matter of Sibrun, supra. To date, he has not shown that he has any pending prima facie approvable applications for relief from removal or any approved applications. Id.
 
The denial of a continuance will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing, and here the respondent has not shown such (Respondent’s Appeal Brief; I.J. at 1-3; Tr. at 1-28). See Matter of Perez-Andrade, supra; Matter of Sibrun, supra.
 
*3 To the extent the respondent is claiming ineffective assistance by one or more of his prior attorneys, he has not complied with any of the requirements under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Also, we are not persuaded that there was any per se ineffective assistance of counsel in this case, regarding pursuit of a U-Visa or otherwise (Resp. Br. at 5; I.J. at 1-3; Tr. at 1-21; Status Letter; Motion to Withdraw).
 
Finally, the respondent has proffered new evidence during the pendency of his appeal, to wit: e-mail correspondence between the respondent’s niece and Attorney Ruiz-Velasco. We deem this to constitute a motion to remand. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4). However, we are not persuaded that consideration of the new evidence would likely change the outcome in this case; therefore, the motion to remand will be denied. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
