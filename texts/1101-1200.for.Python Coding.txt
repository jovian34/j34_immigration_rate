IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joseph Silver,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent has failed to file a brief on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(2)(E). However, the statement on the respondent’s Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR 26), indicates that the respondent believes he received ineffective assistance of counsel. It is unclear as to whether this respondent, who appears before us pro se, is referring to his representation before the Immigration Judge, or during his criminal trial before the New Jersey Superior Court. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel before the Immigration Judge must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In the instant matter, the respondent has not satisfied any of the requirements we set forth in our decision, such as explaining what arrangement he had with counsel or why he feels that the representation he received was inadequate, or whether he suffered actual prejudice from the allegedly deficient representation. Matter of Lozada, supra. To the extent that the respondent contests an aspect of the validity of his criminal conviction such as the adequacy of his prior counsel in those proceedings, it is well established that this Board cannot entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, nor can this Board go behind the judicial record to determine the guilt or innocence of the alien. Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894 (BIA 1994); Matter of Fortis, 14 I&N Dec. 576, 577 (BIA 1974). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thomas A. Mix, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on March 19, 2003. We denied previous motions on July 25, 2003, and February 5, 2004. The respondent filed another motion to reopen on November 25, 2005, that is both untimely and barred by numerical limitations for motions to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and has equities that should be considered that would warrant reopening of his claim to cancellation of removal. First, there is no reason to toll the time or numerical limitations for motions in this case. The respondent was represented by current counsel at the time we issued our February 5, 2004, decision, yet the pending motion was not filed for over a year and a half later. Moreover, the respondent raised his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel prior to our denial of his motion on February 5, 2004. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed our February 5, 2004, decision on March 13, 2006, Solis-Arenas v. Gonzales, 2006 WL 616064 (9th Cir. Mar. 13, 2006). In its unpublished decision, the Ninth circuit found that the respondent had not shown that an exception to the numerical limitations for motions applied. Moreover, the respondent failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Ninth Circuit found. The pending motion is subject to the same deficiencies as the Ninth Circuit found existed as to the respondent’s last motion.
 
The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Aroon Roy Padharia, Esquire
 
ORDER
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s January 27, 2005, denial of a motion to continue. The Immigration Judge found that because the respondent’s first Form I-140 had been denied, that it was not reasonable to continue the proceedings to allow the respondent to pursue a second Form I-140 through the same employer (I.J. at 2). The record is remanded for further proceedings. We are unable to determine whether the respondent established good cause for a continuance because of the numerous “indiscernibles” (Tr. at 1-4) and the absence of Exhibit 3, referenced.by the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 2). On appeal, the respondent maintains that due to ineffecfive assistance of former counsel, his first Form I-140 was denied, necessitating that the respondent file a new Form I-140. We find remand warranted to allow insertion of the referenced exhibit, to clarify the indiscernibles in the current record, and for further discussion regarding the circumstances of the denial of the first Form I-140. We remind the respondent of the requirements of setting forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA); aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
On appeal, the respondent also argues that he is eligible for voluntary departure. In this regard, we note that the Immigration Judge only offered the respondent either pre-conclusion voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a) or an appeal, but did not consider voluntary departure at the conclusion of proceedings under section 240B(b) of the Act 8 (Tr. at 4). While it would appear that the proceedings were at the Master Calendar stage, which would normally involve a grant of voluntary departure requiring a waiver of appeal, it is also true that the respondent had pursued the only form of relief available to him and was denied a continuance to further pursue it. Therefore, the Immigration Judge may consider voluntary departure at the conclusion of proceedings. Accordingly, we find remand appropriate for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew W. Rau, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)º - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This matter was last before the Board on December 13, 2005, when we denied the respondent’s motion to remand to apply for adjustment of status, and dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his request for a continuance as well as the Immigration Judge’s order removing the respondent to Pakistan. The respondent now moves to reopen these removal proceedings based on the alleged ineffective assistance of his former counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the pending motion to reopen. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is deemed unopposed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). As we find the respondent’s former counsel’s assistance ineffective and resulting prejudice to the respondent’s case, the unopposed motion to reopen will be granted, these removal proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with the following opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
 
Initially, we note that the respondent’s motion to reopen was timely filed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (90-day deadline). Moreover, we find that the respondent has complied with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which have been set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Current counsel for the respondent asserts that the respondent’s former counsel erroneously advised the respondent that he should not accept a voluntary departure from the Immigration Judge because he would be eligible for adjustment of status in the United States upon the approval of the Form I-140 Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker filed on his behalf. We have no indication that former counsel has responded to current counsel’s accusatory letter, the respondent’s affidavit, and the bar complaint. Furthermore, former counsel previously moved this Board for a remand, subsequent to the I-140 Approval, arguing the respondent’s eligibility for adjustment of status where the respondent was ineligible to adjust his status to permanent residence in this country. See Decision of the Board, dated December 13, 2005; Respondent’s Motion to Remand, dated June 18, 2004. Under these circumstances, we must find ineffective assistance of former counsel that prejudiced the respondent’s case. Based on the evidence before us, we conclude that former counsel’s inadequate performance prevented the respondent from receiving a voluntary departure order, which the Immigration Judge declared he was willing to grant (Tr. at 5-7, 14-16). If the respondent had accepted and complied with a voluntary departure order, he would have been eligible for consular processing of an immigrant visa absent the need for a waiver of a final removal order.
 
*2 As the respondent has established that he suffered ineffective assistance by former counsel and resulting prejudice, the appeal will be sustained, these removal proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for an adjudication of the respondent’s application for the minimal relief of voluntary departure.
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, these removal proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and for the entry of a new decision.

File: A79 425 482 - Miami

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Madeline Garcia, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Stuart A. Siegel
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before us on April 3, 2006, when we granted the respondent’s request for a stay of his removal proceeding, pending our consideration of his motion to reconsider. On February 21, 2006, the respondent filed a Motion to Reconsider our January 19, 2006, order, claiming the ineffective assistance of his former counsel, as well as an Emergency Motion for Stay of Removal. On March 6, 2006, the Department of Homeland security (DHS) filed an opposition to the motion to reconsider1. On January 19, 2006, we had dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his application for adjustment of status. We also denied the respondent’s motion to remand based on a new affidavit of support, submitted during the pendency of the appeal, as we found that the respondent had not provided an explanation for why the Affidavit of Support he attempted to submit was previously unavailable and could not have been discovered at the prior hearing.
 
We note that we did not receive the respondent’s appellate brief dated July 3, 2005, or any of the attachments to his brief, by the time we decided his appeal, and these documents were therefore not considered. The attachments consist of statements under the penalty of perjury dated July 2005, from the respondent, his wife, and his mother-in- law, as well as a Complaint to the Florida Bar, dated June 29, 2005, complaining about the actions of the respondent’s former attorney in this case2.
 
The DHS notes in its opposition that the argument about the Affidavit of Support is essentially the same argument the respondent made in his appeal brief, challenging the denial of his adjustment application. On April 3, 2006, we granted the respondent’s request for a stay of removal pending our consideration of his motion to reconsider. The motion to reconsider will be granted, and the record will be remanded.
 
In his motion to reconsider, the respondent argues that his former counsel provided him with ineffective assistance, by failing to file a proper Affidavit of Support (I-864) with a qualifying sponsor. We note that an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel in a motion to reconsider must show prejudice. See Dakane v. United States Attorney General, 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005). Prejudice exists of the kind sufficient to support such a claim in immigration proceedings when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is reasonable probability that, but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. Id at 1274. In this case, the respondent alleges that his former counsel’s failure to file an appropriate affidavit of support constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. We find this argument to have merit, as the denial of adjustment relief was based, in large part, on his former counsel’s misunderstanding of what needed to be submitted for the Affidavit of Support, and this resulted in prejudice to the respondent. We note that on appeal, the respondent offered a new Affidavit of Support. In addition, one of the attachments to his brief is a complaint filed with the Florida bar by the respondent against his former attorney, and the former attorney was notified of this complaint. As such, it appears that the respondent has facially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 The respondent’s adjustment application was also denied as a matter of discretion because of what the Immigration Judge found to be misrepresentations on the application and in the testimony (I.J. at 16). We note that the DHS approved the I-130 filed by the respondent’s wife. The respondent and his wife now submitted statements to address the discrepancies, and to offer plausible explanations for the inconsistencies identified by the Immigration Judge.
 
Under these circumstances, we will grant the motion, and remand to the Immigration Judge to reconsider the respondent’s adjustment claim. On remand, the Immigration Judge should consider the new filings, including the Affidavit of Support and the Florida bar complaint. He should also reassess the bona fides of the marriage, and take into account the explanations submitted by the respondent and his wife, in which they account for discrepancies in the record regarding residence locations and employment.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider will be granted, and the record will be remanded.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted, and the record is remanded for proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

We note that these statements appear to comply with the requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 1746, titled “Unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury”. This statute provides that whenever any matter is required to be supported or proved by a sworn declaration, such matter may, with like force and effect, be supported or proved by an unsworn declaration subscribed as true under penalty of perjury. It also provides the prescribed wording for such declaration.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on September 29, 2004, when we summarily affirmed an Immigration Judge’s May 13, 2004, decision denying the respondent’s application for a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). On December 19, 2005, the respondent submitted a motion to reissue the Board’s decision which was rejected because the motion was not accompanied by the required filing fee or fee waiver form. The respondent perfected his motion and filed it on January 24, 2006. Through his motion, the respondent claims that his former attorney, Alex Solomiany, Esquire, provided him ineffective assistance by failing to inform him of the Board’s decision until December 8, 2005, and by failing to timely file a petition for review of the Board’s decision with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The respondent also filed a motion for a stay of removal on January 17, 2006. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a response in opposition to the motion. The motions are denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen and reissue the Board’s decision is untimely filed because it was not filed within 90 days of our September 29, 2004, decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent points to no exceptions to the time restrictions on motions to reopen which might be applicable to the instant motion. Moreover, we decline to reopen proceedings sua sponte and reissue our decision based upon the respondent’s claim that he received ineffective assistance from his former attorney. The respondent has failed to comply with any of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Because the respondent has failed to comply with any of the Lozada requirements, his motion to reopen and reissue the Board’s prior decision, based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, is denied. See Dakane v. United States Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005); Gbaya v. United States Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1221-23 (11th Cir. 2003). The motion to reissue is therefore denied and the respondent’s motion for a stay of removal is denied as moot.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reopen and reissue is denied and the motion for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

IN RE: DIANA LORENA RODRIGUEZ
File: AXX XX9 442 - Houston
May 8, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
  
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas Wachholz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John Donovan,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on September 6, 2005. She filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge arguing that her counsel instructed her not to appear for her hearing because a motion to change venue was submitted with the Immigration Court. On December 6, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied the motion. The Immigration Judge noted the record did not contain a motion to change venue. The Immigration Judge further ruled the respondent had an obligation to appear for her hearing because she did not receive notification that the Immigration Judge granted her motion. The respondent appealed that ruling to the Board.
 
We have reviewed the record, and note, as did the Immigration Judge, that the respondent’s motion to change venue is not contained therein prior to September 6, 2005. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is obligated to appear for her scheduled hearing until the request to change venue is granted. The Board has held that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the respondent of his or her responsibility to appear, and unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988); Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 1985), aff’d, Patel v. INS, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986). Counsel’s assumption that the motion will be granted is not a valid reason to excuse the respondent from her failure to appear. This aspect of the Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
The respondent further argues in her brief that these proceedings should be reopened because she relied on her attorney’s instruction that it was unnecessary to appear for the hearing. Counsel for the respondent submitted an affidavit that states that he told the respondent that her motion to change venue to Arlington, Virginia, will likely be granted, and she need not appear. The respondent argues that she should not be penalized because she relied on the advice of her attorney.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
*2 It is also required that the claimant establish that she suffered prejudice as a result of her attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998). We further note the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recognizes as valid the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383 (5th Cir. 2001); Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497 (5th Cir. 2000).
 
The respondent has not satisfied the procedural requirements for proving that she was the victim of attorney negligence. The respondent has not filed an affidavit in support of her motion. She also did not file a complaint against her counsel with the appropriate disciplinary authority, or explain why she did not do so. It is therefore inappropriate to reopen these proceedings based on the respondent having been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: LI JUAN WU
File: A77 293 514 - New York
May 5, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent is a female, and a citizen of the People’s Republic of China. On December 10, 1999, the respondent was ordered removed from the United States because she did not appear for her hearing. The respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen with an Immigration Judge on November 3, 2005. Therein, the respondent indicates that her prior attorney failed to inform her of the correct time of the hearing. She further indicates that she is now the mother of two United States citizen children, and fears persecution in China on account of her alleged violation of the population control law. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on November 14, 2005, and this appeal followed.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not show that her failure to appear for her hearing was caused by “exceptional circumstances.” The respondent’s motion to reopen was also filed untimely with the Immigration Judge. In Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000), the court recognized the doctrine of “equitable tolling” of the statute of limitations regarding the filing of a motion to reopen. The court held that an alien must demonstrate not only that the alien’s constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll. Id. In that case, the court concluded that the alien failed to demonstrate such diligence, and concluded that equitable tolling did not apply. Id.
 
Accordingly, under Iavorski v. INS, supra, the Board must first address whether the respondent was denied due process in these proceedings based upon the ineffective assistance of her former counsel. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved applicant setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the applicant in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640.
 
*2 In the instant case, the respondent has not satisfied any of the procedural requirements for proving that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm this aspect of the Immigration Judge’s decision. We further note the respondent has not shown that she pursued reopening with due diligence as she has not explained why she waited approximately 6 years to seek reopening. We therefore, agree with the Immigration Judge that it is inappropriate to reopen these proceedings based on the respondent having shown that she was the victim of attorney negligence.
 
The respondent further argues in her motion to reopen and on appeal that these proceedings should be reopened because of the birth of her two United States citizen children, and her fear of persecution in China on account thereof. There is no time limit on the filing of motion to reopen if the basis of the motion is to apply for relief under section under section 208 or 241(b)(3) and is based upon changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(c)(7)(C)(ii). See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i) and Matter of A-N- & R-M-N-, 22 I&N Dec. 953 (BIA 1999) (holding that aliens seeking to reopen proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of deportation or removal who have presented evidence establishing materially changed circumstances in their homeland or place of last habitual residence, such that they meet the general requirements for motions to reopen, need not demonstrate “reasonable cause” for their failure to appear at the prior hearing).
 
The Immigration Judge neglected to address this issue in his decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. However, in Guan v. Ashcroft, 345 F.3d 47 (2d Cir. 2003), the Second Circuit concluded that changed circumstances arising in the United States are not within the exception found above. See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The respondent fears the “continued” implementation of Chinese population control policies rather than a material change in those policies. It is therefore inappropriate to reopen these proceedings. See also Matter of C-C-, 23 I&N Dec, 899 (BIA 2006).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: LI JUAN WU
File: AXX XX3 514 - New York
May 5, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent is a female, and a citizen of the People’s Republic of China. On December 10, 1999, the respondent was ordered removed from the United States because she did not appear for her hearing. The respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen with an Immigration Judge on November 3, 2005. Therein, the respondent indicates that her prior attorney failed to inform her of the correct time of the hearing. She further indicates that she is now the mother of two United States citizen children, and fears persecution in China on account of her alleged violation of the population control law. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on November 14, 2005, and this appeal followed.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not show that her failure to appear for her hearing was caused by “exceptional circumstances.” The respondent’s motion to reopen was also filed untimely with the Immigration Judge. In Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000), the court recognized the doctrine of “equitable tolling” of the statute of limitations regarding the filing of a motion to reopen. The court held that an alien must demonstrate not only that the alien’s constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll. Id. In that case, the court concluded that the alien failed to demonstrate such diligence, and concluded that equitable tolling did not apply. Id.
 
Accordingly, under Iavorski v. INS, supra, the Board must first address whether the respondent was denied due process in these proceedings based upon the ineffective assistance of her former counsel. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved applicant setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the applicant in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640.
 
*2 In the instant case, the respondent has not satisfied any of the procedural requirements for proving that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm this aspect of the Immigration Judge’s decision. We further note the respondent has not shown that she pursued reopening with due diligence as she has not explained why she waited approximately 6 years to seek reopening. We therefore, agree with the Immigration Judge that it is inappropriate to reopen these proceedings based on the respondent having shown that she was the victim of attorney negligence.
 
The respondent further argues in her motion to reopen and on appeal that these proceedings should be reopened because of the birth of her two United States citizen children, and her fear of persecution in China on account thereof. There is no time limit on the filing of motion to reopen if the basis of the motion is to apply for relief under section under section 208 or 241(b)(3) and is based upon changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(c)(7)(C)(ii). See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i) and Matter of A-N- & R-M-N-, 22 I&N Dec. 953 (BIA 1999) (holding that aliens seeking to reopen proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of deportation or removal who have presented evidence establishing materially changed circumstances in their homeland or place of last habitual residence, such that they meet the general requirements for motions to reopen, need not demonstrate “reasonable cause” for their failure to appear at the prior hearing).
 
The Immigration Judge neglected to address this issue in his decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. However, in Guan v. Ashcroft, 345 F.3d 47 (2d Cir. 2003), the Second Circuit concluded that changed circumstances arising in the United States are not within the exception found above. See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The respondent fears the “continued” implementation of Chinese population control policies rather than a material change in those policies. It is therefore inappropriate to reopen these proceedings. See also Matter of C-C-, 23 I&N Dec, 899 (BIA 2006).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: SANDRA MUNOZ-HURTADO
File: AXX XX7 913 - San Diego
May 2, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Luis Carlos Ayala, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Janet L. Murray
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 18, 2005, decision, in which the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged in the Notice to Appear. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and her motion to remand will be denied.
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge with the following additions. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole for in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent presents multiple arguments on appeal, which will be addressed in turn. Foremost, is the respondent’s argument that she received ineffective assistance from her former counsel. The respondent claims, on appeal, that she did not get competent representation and that her former counsel failed to appear at her April 18, 2005, hearing. The respondent also avers that her former counsel failed to file a motion regarding a request for a change of venue and outlining forms of relief available to the respondent. The respondent admits that the Immigration Judge provided her with a complaint form relating to ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, the record reflects that the Immigration Judge instructed the respondent that she (the respondent) knew best what happened between her and her counsel and that, if she believed that such counsel did not represent her adequately, then she could file a complaint. See Tr. at 28. However, there is no indication that a complaint has ever been filed.
 
In order to show that her former counsel was ineffective, the respondent must normally meet the three requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Ninth Circuit has generally found that the requirements enumerated in Matter of Lozada, supra, are reasonable, “and under ordinary circumstances the BIA does not abuse its discretion when it denies a motion to remand or reopen based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel where the petitioner fails to meet the requirements of Lozada.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir.2000). Here, the respondent failed to set forth in an affidavit the agreement that she had with her former counsel regarding such counsel’s representation. She failed to provide evidence that her former counsel was informed of the allegations of ineffective assistance and allowed to respond. In addition, she failed to indicate that a complaint was lodged with the bar, or provide reasons explaining why she did not lodge such a complaint. As the respondent failed to satisfy the Matter of Lozada, supra criteria, we find that she has not adequately established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 The respondent additionally avers that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion by denying her request for a continuance to obtain different counsel. However, we note that the respondent testified that she was aware that her former counsel did not want go to court in San Diego, due to the commute. At the respondent’s initial hearing (December 20, 2004), the respondent’s former counsel indicated that the respondent could obtain new counsel if the case was going to be heard in San Diego. See Tr. at 12. It is unclear exactly what was communicated, to the respondent, by her former counsel, as the respondent has not submitted an affidavit concerning her agreement with her former counsel. The respondent indicated that she had already thought about getting different counsel in San Diego, and she had talked to another attorney prior to her hearing about taking her case. It is unclear why the respondent would have been talking to another counsel about taking her case if she truly thought that her former counsel would be continuing to represent her, as she suggested at her hearing. Considering the facts in this particular case, we find that it is reasonable and acceptable for the Immigration Judge to have denied the request for an additional continuance, while providing instructions concerning the filing of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which we note the respondent failed to follow. On the other hand, we note that there is no medical evidence provided concerning the respondent’s former counsel’s alleged appointment on the day of the hearing. See Tr. at 18. In addition, the Immigration Judge pointed out that he did not find good cause to again continue the respondent’s hearing, for her to obtain new counsel, when there was no indication that there was any relief from removal available to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.6; see also Biwot v. Gonzales, 403. F.3d 1094, 1100 (noting that, if the petitioner does not affirmatively waive his or her right to counsel, the Immigration Judge must inquire whether there is good cause to grant petitioner more time to obtain counsel). The respondent does not indicate on appeal that any relief is currently available to her. There is no evidence that the out come of the respondent’s case would change if the record were remanded. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992). Thus, there is insufficient evidence that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion, that due process was denied, or that a remand is warranted in the instant case, based on the denial of a continuance.
 
The respondent also avers that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion by denying the respondent’s request for a change of venue. However, similar to the basis for his denial of a continuance, the Immigration Judge found that there was no good cause to grant such request as there was no relief available to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.20. The respondent indicates on appeal that there was good cause to change venue, as she needed to present witnesses who lived in Los Angeles. However, there is no indication that the respondent has any relief available to her concerning which there would be a need to present witnesses. The respondent does not indicate that she is eligible for any relief from removal, nor is there any application for relief presented by the respondent. Hence, we can not find that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion by denying such request or motion for a change of venue.
 
*3 The respondent argues that she should be able to withdraw her former admissions, with respect to the allegations and charge of removal delineated in the Notice to Appear, due to the ineffective assistance provided by her former counsel. However, as noted above, the respondent has failed to adequately establish ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, we have determined that, absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made before, during, or even after a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity binds his client as a judicial admission. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986). Consequently, in the instant case, as no egregious circumstances have been sufficiently established, the admission with regard to the allegations and charge is binding on the respondent in the instant case and maybe relied upon as evidence of removability.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed and her motion to remand is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eduardo A. Paredes, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Catherine Halliday-Roberts,
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The Immigration Judge neglected to prepare a separate oral or written decision in this matter addressing the issues raised in the respondent’s motion to reopen, and, therefore, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for preparation of a full decision. See Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999). The Immigration Judge’s form order dated November 21, 2005, states that the “respondent has predicated his motion on an assertion of a prior attorney’s ineffective assistance - but has failed to file a bar claim or otherwise conform to Lozada.”
 
The Immigration Judge failed to address the issue of notice raised in the respondent’s motion. Specifically, the respondent contends that he failed to appear at his hearing because he did not receive notice of the hearing from the Immigration Court. Contrary to the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the motion to reopen, the respondent never raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge failed to determine whether the respondent received proper service of the Order to Show Cause and the notice of hearing in accordance with section 242B of the Act and applicable case law. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Huete, 20 I&N Dec. 250 (BIA 1991). We find that the Immigration Judge’s decision provides an insufficient basis upon which the Board can adequately conduct a meaningful review. Upon preparation of the full decision, the Immigration Judge shall issue an order administratively returning the record to the Board. The Immigration Judge shall serve the administrative return order on the respondent and the Department of Homeland Security. The Board will thereafter give the parties an opportunity to submit briefs in accordance with the regulations.
 
ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court for further action as required above.

File: A41 654 161 - New York

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lola Oni, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anne E. Gannon
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal will be dismissed, as the respondent waived the right to appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) argues that the appeal should be dismissed summarily.
 
The respondent’s final removal hearing took place on January 18, 2006, and the respondent was represented by attorney Courtney Smith (Tr. at 318-23). The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent was undeserving of cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), after weighing the positive factors against the respondent’s criminal record. Counsel reserved the right to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision (Tr. at 321). On January 24, 2006, Smith wrote a letter to the Immigration Judge stating that the respondent “has authorized me to withdraw his reservation of appeal of your decision on January 18, 2006”. Counsel further stated that the respondent “understands his right to appeal but wants the order of the court to become final immediately.” As a result, on February 1, 2006, the Immigration Judge issued an amended order in which he noted that the respondent had waived appeal. The respondent nevertheless submitted a Notice of Appeal on February 17, 2006, that was rejected for a filing defect, and filed on February 24, 2006.
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(2)(G) (summary dismissal of appeal appropriate where appeal is barred based on waiver of right to appeal).
 
Counsel submitted a letter in which she claims that the respondent did not authorize attorney Smith to submit the letter withdrawing the right to appeal. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001) (a party wishing to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or an appeal directly with the Board).
 
Despite making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has complied with none of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making such a claim. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108, 110 (2d Cir. 1993). These cases require that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Zheng v. U. S. Dept. of Justice, 409 F.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2005). Most particularly, there is no affidavit from the respondent setting out the claims against former counsel, and former counsel has not been allowed to respond to the charges made in current counsel’s statement.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Edgardo Quintanilla, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Eric Bakken
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)º - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)º - Controlled substance violation
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen. This is the respondent’s third time before the Board. This case was last before us on August 2, 2004, when we affirmed without opinion the Immigration Judge’s decision denying voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion. This motion to reopen is untimely by over a year, and we do not find that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel or that this case warrants reopening sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
First, the respondent has failed to comply with any of the requirements for a motion based on ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Also, contrary to the respondent’s argument, the conviction record submitted to the Immigration Judge does indicate that the respondent was convicted for delivering cocaine (Warrant of Commitment).¿FN1º Therefore, we find no ineffective assistance that is plain on the record.
 
Although the respondent has entitled his motion a motion to reopen, the respondent’s second argument, that the Board erred in its first decision, dated March 7, 2003, by stating that the respondent had been convicted of an aggravated felony, is more properly considered a motion to reconsider. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). Nevertheless, the motion remains untimely and we find no error in that decision. Although the respondent’s controlled substance conviction does not render him removable as an aggravated felon because there is insufficient evidence that he was convicted after admission, his offense remains an aggravated felony as that term is defined under the Act. Accordingly, the motion is denied as untimely. The request for a stay pending consideration of the motion is denied as moot.

Footnotes

1

We note that the respondent’s conviction record has not been identified with an exhibit number. As the respondent has not challenged the admission of his conviction record and it specifies that the controlled substance involved was cocaine, we find the absence of an exhibit number to be harmless error. Also, we find it unnecessary to address the conviction documents submitted by the DHS on appeal.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lizette Espinosa, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 21, 2004, which denied her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), for lack of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. Additionally, the respondent moves for remand, alleging that her ineffective assistance of counsel prejudiced her claim for relief. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
First, we find that the respondent has complied with the requirements relating to motions based on ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). She submitted an affidavit detailing her agreement with her former law firm (Respondent’s Exh. 1). She also filed a complaint form with the State Bar of California against the attorney who represented her at the merits hearing, Heinrich Davis, and notified him of her complaint in writing (Respondent’s Exh. 4).
 
In order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel in a removal proceeding, a respondent must demonstrate that the attorney failed to perform with sufficient competence. See Lin v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent is also required to show that her case was prejudiced by her counsel’s performance. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899-900 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent states in her affidavit that she had no contact with any attorney from the law firm representing her until 30 minutes before her hearing on November 8, 2004. A secretary from the firm called her a week in advance and told her to arrive at the office one hour before the hearing; at that time, the secretary briefly interviewed the respondent prior to the attorney’s arrival. At this point, the respondent still did not know what sort of relief she was seeking. Her case was continued until December 21, 2004. The respondent states that at that point she still was unprepared to testify about potential hardship to her lawful permanent resident mother and three United States citizen daughters - ages 15, 14, and 3. She alleges that her former attorney’s failure to elicit information and documentary evidence from her about her daughters and her 72-year-old mother, who currently lives with her, negatively affected the outcome of her case. The respondent also suggests that the Immigration Judge made assumptions about her husband’s willingness to support her and her daughters financially that would not have been made if her former attorney had obtained basic information from her prior to the hearing.
 
*2 We find that the evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that the respondent’s former attorney failed to perform with sufficient competence. In addition to the issues raised in the affidavit, the transcript reflects that the attorney failed to correct an error on the respondent’s cancellation application prior to her hearing, that he submitted 140 pages of evidence on the date of the November 2004 hearing in violation of the Immigration Court’s filing rules, and that he relied on documents obtained by the respondent’s first representative in these proceedings, who was charged with immigration fraud in 2003 (Tr. at 12-14, 26-27; Respondent’s Exhs. 2, 3). We also note that the Immigration Judge described the testimony regarding the hardship issue as “scant” (Tr. at 64). We therefore conclude that the attorney’s poor performance may indeed have affected the outcome of the respondent’s proceedings. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968 (9th Cir. 2004); Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004). Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN RE: FOWAD NASRULLAH CHAUDHRY
File: AXX XX9 893 - Elizabeth
April 19, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James Irani, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen. The motion is both time and number barred, and we find that no exception to the statutory and regulatory restrictions on motions applies. See section 240(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 1229a(c); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
On March 1, 2004, the Board affirmed, without opinion, an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion seeking reopening and the rescission of an in absentia removal order that was entered on June 25, 2003. Therefore, the June 25, 2003, order remains the final administrative order in the case. The instant motion makes an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, it fails to comply with the Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and thus has not established a basis for tolling the statutory and regulatory deadlines for motions. See Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 132-34 (3d Cir. 2001); Mahmood v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 248 (3rd Cir. 2005). Specifically, the respondent did not notify his prior counsel of the charges against him and provide him an opportunity to respond.
 
In any event, he has not shown that he was prejudiced by ineffective assistance, since he was not represented by counsel until after his in absentia order was entered. He is not seeking to apply for previously unavailable relief, but rather appears to be asserting that he was eligible for cancellation of removal at the time he appeared at an earlier hearing and should have been so advised by the Immigration Judge at that point, and later by the counsel who assisted him on the motion to reopen. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998) (the rescission standards need not be met in certain circumstances where the alien seeks to apply for relief that was not available at the time of the hearing).
 
He abandoned his opportunity to apply for discretionary relief when he failed to appear for his hearing. To the extent that he is now arguing that, had he known of the possibility of relief in the form of cancellation of removal, he would have shown up for his hearing, that is not an exceptional circumstance which would excuse his failure to appear as ordered even if a second motion to reopen were permitted. Such an argument is also inconsistent with his earlier claim that he did not appear because of his confusion over the scheduled date. Further, if his argument is that the counsel who represented him on the motion after the in absentia order was entered should have informed him of his eligibility for cancellation, he has not shown prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent is statutori!y ineligible for cancellation of removal because he failed to appeal for his hearing after proper notice was provided, and because he was unsuccessful in demonstrating exceptional circumstances. See section 240(b)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(7).
 
*2 The motion is denied.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: MARCO ANTONIO LOPEZ LARA
File: AXX XX1 855 - Los Angeles
April 18, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio Bueno, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated November 16, 2005, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen an order of removal entered in absentia on September 16, 2005. This appeal followed. The appeal will be sustained.
 
The respondent is a citizen of Mexico, and a lawful permanent resident of the United States. The Immigration Judge notified the respondent that he would adjudicate the respondent’s section 212(c) application on September 16, 2005, at 1:00 p.m. in courtroom “F” located on the 14th floor of the Immigration Court. The respondent does not dispute that such notice was provided. The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal in absentia because the respondent did not appear for the hearing. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on October 5, 2005. Therein, the respondent indicates in his affidavit that his attorney advised him to appear for his hearing on September 16, 2005, in courtroom “U” on the 17th floor of the Immigration Court. He further indicates that his lawyer informed him that day to leave the Immigration Court building because the Immigration Judge was unavailable, and the case will be rescheduled. The respondent has provided an affidavit from his counsel’s secretary, and other proof of the erroneous instruction given to him by or on behalf of his attorney. The Immigration Judge found the notice of hearing proper, and the respondent had not shown “exceptional circumstance” to excuse his absence. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion, and the respondent appealed that ruling to the Board.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, but has not filed a bar complaint against counsel. In Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we held that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, require, among other things, that the alien file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. See also Ray v. Gonzales, 435 F.3d 1001 (9th Cir. 2006). In Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212F.3d 518, 525-526 (9th Cir. 2000), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the Lozada requirements generally reasonable, but full compliance is not required if the record independently shows that the “ineffective assistance” claim is legitimate and substantial. In addition, the Ninth Circuit has held that statements made in a motion to reopen must be accepted as true unless inherently incredible. See Lopez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 847 (9th Cir. 2004); Maroufi v. INS, 772 F.2d 597 (9th Cir. 1985). We further recognize the Ninth Circuit has held that a bar complaint may not be required where an alien offers a reasonable excuse for the omission and there is no suggestion of collusion between counsel and the alien. See Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 938 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
*2 In the instant case, the information provided in the respondent’s affidavit is believable and corroborated. We further cannot identify an indication that the respondent and counsel colluded to mislead the Immigration Judge and the Board. We therefore will not find the respondent’s failure to submit a complaint against counsel fatal to his request for reopening. We further find the respondent was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and will reopen these proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Piepmeier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 4, 2005, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. An Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent deported in absentia for her failure to appear for the hearing on February 16, 1989. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal and in her motion, the respondent contends that she failed to appear for her hearing on February 16, 1989, due to ineffective assistance of counsel. She states that her former attorney of record, Oscar R. Perez, advised the respondent not to appear for her hearing as she would be immediately deported at the hearing. The respondent indicates that she filed for NACARA relief, although the respondent has not submitted any evidence that she filed for such relief. The respondent seeks reopening to demonstrate that she is eligible for relief under NACARA. In her motion to reopen, the respondent argued that equitable tolling should apply in her case, and that ineffective assistance of counsel is clear on the face of the administrative record since Mr. Perez failed to file an appeal on the respondent’s behalf after she was ordered deported in absentia.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, supra.
 
Precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit provides that while the requirements of Lozada are generally reasonable, they need not be rigidly enforced where their purpose is fully served by other means. Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237, 1240 n.6 (9th Cir. 2000). The Ninth Circuit determined that “Lozada is intended to ensure both that an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra. Furthermore, where the face of the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel, there has been substantial compliance with the rule. Id.
 
*2 The respondent failed to comply with all of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent filed a motion to reopen pro se, in which she indicates that Mr. Perez advised her not to appear for her hearing on February 16, 1989. However, there is no evidence that her former counsel was informed of the allegations of ineffective assistance and given an opportunity to respond. The respondent also failed to submit a complaint to the State Bar of California regarding Mr. Perez. We note that there is no EOIR-28 form in the record of proceedings to indicate that Mr. Perez was representing the respondent before the Immigration Court. This is not a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel that may excuse strict compliance with the Lozada requirements. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004) (court found that alien had not substantially satisfied Lozada when he failed to submit an affidavit and could not prove that he gave former attorney notice of the ineffective assistance allegations or an adequate opportunity to respond). Furthermore, while equitable tolling is available for untimely motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in pursing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See e.g. Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir.); Socop-Gonzalez, 272 F.3d 1176; Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). Consequently, the respondent has failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, and she has failed to demonstrate reasonable cause for her failure to appear. Finally, despite the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order of deportation dated February 16, 1989, the respondent waited almost 17 years before seeking to reopen her deportation proceedings.
 
The respondent also claims that she is eligible for relief pursuant to section 203 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA). Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.43(c), an initial motion to reopen was due on September 11, 1998, and an application for suspension of deportation (Form I-881) had to be submitted by November 18, 1999. See 64 Fed. Reg. 40389-90 (July 26, 1999). The Immigration Judge and the Board are without authority to extend the time limits for filing a motion to reopen and a suspension application pursuant to section 203 of NACARA. The respondent has not submitted any evidence that she timely filed a motion to reopen pursuant to NACARA. On appeal the respondent indicates that she filed an application for relief under NACARA, but she does not state when it was filed, nor has she submitted a copy of her application. Therefore, the respondent failed to demonstrate that she timely filed an application for relief under NACARA by November 18, 1999. Furthermore, the respondent has not alleged that equitable tolling should be applied regarding her application for relief under NACARA. We note that precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this case arises, provides that section 203(c) is a statute of limitations and is subject to equitable tolling. See Albillo-De Leon v. Gonzales, 410 F.3d 1090, 1098 (9th Cir.) (alien’s motion to reopen was deemed timely filed after establishing that equitable tolling applied due to ineffective assistance of counsel and alien had acted with due diligence in pursuing matter); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cr. 2003)(recognizing equitable tolling on motion to reopen during periods when alien is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the alien “acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error”); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1225 (9th Cir. 2002)(finding due diligence since new counsel promptly retained and motion to reopen filed after aliens learned conclusively that they had been misled by a non-attorney). We do not find that reopening is warranted in this matter. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

An Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent deported in absentia for her failure to appear for the hearing on February 16, 1989. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal and in her motion, the respondent contends that she failed to appear for her hearing on February 16, 1989, due to ineffective assistance of counsel. She states that her former attorney of record, Oscar R. Perez, advised the respondent not to appear for her hearing as she would be immediately deported at the hearing.

In her motion to reopen, the respondent argued that equitable tolling should apply in her case, and that ineffective assistance of counsel is clear on the face of the administrative record since Mr. Perez failed to file an appeal on the respondent’s behalf after she was ordered deported in absentia.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied.

INS, supra. Furthermore, where the face of the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel, there has been substantial compliance with the rule. Id.
 
*2 The respondent failed to comply with all of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent filed a motion to reopen pro se, in which she indicates that Mr. Perez advised her not to appear for her hearing on February 16, 1989. However, there is no evidence that her former counsel was informed of the allegations of ineffective assistance and given an opportunity to respond. The respondent also failed to submit a complaint to the State Bar of California regarding Mr. Perez. We note that there is no EOIR-28 form in the record of proceedings to indicate that Mr. Perez was representing the respondent before the Immigration Court. This is not a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel that may excuse strict compliance with the Lozada requirements. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004) (court found that alien had not substantially satisfied Lozada when he failed to submit an affidavit and could not prove that he gave former attorney notice of the ineffective assistance allegations or an adequate opportunity to respond). Furthermore, while equitable tolling is available for untimely motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in pursing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See e.g. Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir.); Socop-Gonzalez, 272 F.3d 1176; Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). Consequently, the respondent has failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, and she has failed to demonstrate reasonable cause for her failure to appear. Finally, despite the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order of deportation dated February 16, 1989, the respondent waited almost 17 years before seeking to reopen her deportation proceedings.
 
The respondent also claims that she is eligible for relief pursuant to section 203 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA). Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.43(c), an initial motion to reopen was due on September 11, 1998, and an application for suspension of deportation (Form I-881) had to be submitted by November 18, 1999. See 64 Fed. Reg. 40389-90 (July 26, 1999). The Immigration Judge and the Board are without authority to extend the time limits for filing a motion to reopen and a suspension application pursuant to section 203 of NACARA. The respondent has not submitted any evidence that she timely filed a motion to reopen pursuant to NACARA. On appeal the respondent indicates that she filed an application for relief under NACARA, but she does not state when it was filed, nor has she submitted a copy of her application. Therefore, the respondent failed to demonstrate that she timely filed an application for relief under NACARA by November 18, 1999. Furthermore, the respondent has not alleged that equitable tolling should be applied regarding her application for relief under NACARA. We note that precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this case arises, provides that section 203(c) is a statute of limitations and is subject to equitable tolling. See Albillo-De Leon v. Gonzales, 410 F.3d 1090, 1098 (9th Cir.) (alien’s motion to reopen was deemed timely filed after establishing that equitable tolling applied due to ineffective assistance of counsel and alien had acted with due diligence in pursuing matter); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cr. 2003)(recognizing equitable tolling on motion to reopen during periods when alien is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the alien “acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error”); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1225 (9th Cir. 2002)(finding due diligence since new counsel promptly retained and motion to reopen filed after aliens learned conclusively that they had been misled by a non-attorney). We do not find that reopening is warranted in this matter. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: JUAN MANUEL OROZCO-SOLIS
File: AXX XX7 979 - Portland
April 11, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David N. Shomloo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on August 14, 2002, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s January 13, 1999, decision denying the respondent’s motion to terminate removal proceedings pursuant to 8 C.F.R. §1239.2(f), so that he could proceed to a final hearing on his naturalization application. On October 13, 2005, more than three years after we issued a final administrative order in this case, the respondent filed this untimely motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
This case presents three issues: first, whether equitable tolling applies in this case; second, whether we should exercise our sua sponte authority and reopen these proceedings on our own motion; and, third, whether the respondent has presented an ineffective assistance of counsel claim that justifies reopening. For the reasons stated below, we find that this case does not warrant equitable tolling, and, we would have reopened these proceedings on our own motion, but the respondent failed to present an ineffective assistance claim that warrants reopening. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
First, because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether this case warrants equitable tolling. The Ninth Circuit has held that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
We do not find that the respondent’s situation falls within the Ninth Circuit’s equitable tolling policy for aliens who have filed with the Board otherwise untimely motions in which they raise allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. Id. The respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his former attorney, Mr. Job Valverde. While it appears that Mr. Valverde failed to inform the respondent of his right to file a petition for review of our August 14, 2002, order, the respondent failed to act with diligence when Mr. Valverde’s ineffectiveness became apparent. Despite Mr. Valverde’s failure to inform the respondent of his appeal rights, on September 18, 2002, the respondent filed a petition for review of our August 14, 2002, decision with the Ninth Circuit. On April 14, 2003, the Court denied the petition as untimely. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 15-18, 22. Even applying equitable tolling to his case, the clock began running at the latest on April 14, 2003. However, the respondent did not file his motion to reopen until October 13, 2005, more than two years later. The respondent could have personally filed a motion to reopen setting forth the facts of his case, but he failed to do so. The respondent did not act with due diligence.
 
*2 Second, the respondent asks that we reopen these proceedings on our own motion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 12. In Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), we held that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship.
 
We find this case presents such exceptional circumstances due to a June 24, 2003, federal district court decision ordering the Attorney General to naturalize the respondent and declaring the Immigration Judge’s January 13, 1999, removal order null and void. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 24-34. The respondent’s motion to reopen is supported by documentation establishing that the respondent sought judicial review of the denial of his naturalization application pursuant to section 310(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1421(c). On June 24, 2003, the United States District Court for the District of Oregon found that the Immigration Judge erred in ordering the respondent removed from the United States. The District Court ordered that the respondent be naturalized. On August 4, 2005, the Ninth Circuit vacated the District Court’s order based on its determination that a district court has no jurisdiction to review an Immigration Judge’s removal order. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 36-37.
 
We recognize that the District Court was reviewing the denial of the respondent’s naturalization application and that naturalization proceedings are separate and distinct from removal proceedings. Nevertheless, the District Court found that the respondent was erroneously ordered deported. That District Court order was not vacated until two years after it was issued. During that time, the respondent could reasonably believe that it was unnecessary to reopen these removal proceedings. The respondent filed the instant motion to reopen shortly after the Ninth Circuit vacated the District Court’s order. Given these exceptional circumstances, we would have reopened on our own motion if the respondent had established that he merited reopening. He failed to do so.
 
The respondent has failed to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim that warrants reopening. The respondent asserts that his prior counsel, Mr. Valverde, provided ineffective assistance because he failed to advise the respondent of his right to file a petition for review of our August 14, 2002, decision. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 8-10. The respondent has complied with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 640 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
We find that Mr. Valverde provided ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to inform the respondent of his appeal rights. See Dearinger ex. rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1045 (9th Cir. 2000). However, we find that the respondent failed to show that he was prejudiced by his inability to file a petition for review of our August 14, 2002, decision. See generally Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003). Initially, we observe that the ineffectiveness alleged by the respondent, that is, his inability to file a petition for review in federal court, is beyond the scope and jurisdiction of these administrative removal proceedings. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(b), (c). The respondent does not show prejudice in the context of these removal hearings because he did not show that Mr. Valverde’s performance before the Immigration Judge or this Board was ineffective.
 
*3 Additionally, we find that the respondent failed to set forth any argument that might have been successful on appeal. The respondent seeks reopening so that we can reissue our decision and he can file a timely petition for review. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 1. However, the respondent has not stated any plausible grounds for relief. He does not allege any factual or legal error in our August 28, 2003, decision which might be rectified on appeal. In sum, the respondent does not show prejudice since he failed to articulate any argument he would have presented on appeal and he failed to show that such argument might have been successful on appeal. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicolas Olano, Esq.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision dated January 31, 2006. In her motion, the respondent avers that the Board mistakenly found that she did not comply with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, she contends that, in fact, her former counsel committed no error. Rather, she avers that the Immigration Court erred by telling her former counsel that he would be called by the Immigration Judge “in order to proceed with the hearing,” but did not do so (Motion at 3).
 
However, in denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge found no merit to the respondent’s above-noted claim (I.J. at 5). In rendering this finding the Immigration Judge noted that at no time did the respondent identify the clerk with whom she allegedly spoke. This fact remains true to date. The Immigration Judge also noted that court staff members had no authority to grant motions filed with the Immigration Judge. The respondent has not addressed either of these findings in her motion to reconsider. Moreover, the respondent has not rebutted the Immigration Judge’s finding that her motions and the telephonic request were untimely submitted, and that she had an obligation to appear at her hearing.
 
We recognize that in the respondent’s motion to reopen former counsel averred that he called the court on the day of the hearing and was told by an unidentified clerk that he would be “called by the Immigration Judge later,” although a call never came (Motion at 2). However, it is well established that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the respondent of her responsibility to appear and, unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988); Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 1985), aff’d, Patel v. INS, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986). A respondent should not assume that a motion for a change of venue will be granted particularly where, as here, it is filed in an untimely manner, merely three days before the scheduled hearing, and counsel only called to check on the status of that motion the day of the hearing. Matter of Rivera, supra. In this regard, we note that the Immigration Court opens at 8:00 a.m. and the respondent’s hearing was scheduled for 9:00 a.m. As such, her former counsel’s decision to not attend the hearing despite having at the most a mere hour after his phone call to ascertain whether a decision had been rendered, was, at best, exceptionally imprudent. Given this record, we find no error on the part of the Immigration Court.
 
*2 As noted, the respondent failed to satisfy the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637(BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In sum, we find no error on the part of the Board in dismissing the respondent’s appeal, and reconsideration is not warranted. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b).
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew L. Guadagno, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen so that he may pursue an application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. We will grant the motion sua sponte pursuant to the authority described in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
The respondent argues that he was afforded ineffective assistance during proceedings that concluded with the Immigration Judge’s decision on July 29, 2004. The respondent argues that he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to advise him of the ramifications of waiving appeal, thus resulting in a waiver that was not knowing and voluntary. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Here, the respondent has submitted evidence that establishes that he was not provided effective assistance of counsel. The respondent has submitted evidence that his counsel was representing him in immigration proceedings even though he was disbarred on June 10, 2004, six weeks prior to the respondent’s hearing that resulted in waiving appeal. As we find that the respondent’s waiver of appeal was not a valid and knowledgeable waiver, we find that the respondent did not waive appeal. Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74, 76 (BIA 2001) (ability of a party to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver). Accordingly, proceedings are ordered reopened.
 
We find that the record reveals that the respondent’s counsel failed to understand a basic distinction regarding eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act which resulted in prejudice to the respondent. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The transcript indicates that the respondent’s attorney failed to point out the distinction regarding the termination of continuous physical presence as it relates to eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A and a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act. Tr. at 33-37. The respondent’s conviction does not terminate the accrual of continuous physical presence for section 212(c) purposes, yet the respondent’s counsel’s failure to establish that distinction resulted in the respondent’s inability to seek such relief.¿FN1º As the respondent has submitted evidence that he is prima facie eligible for relief that was not considered by the Immigration Judge, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings on the respondent’s eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility.

File: AXX XX6 251 - Phoenix

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher J. Stender, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Linda I. Spencer-Walters
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This is the fifth time that the respondent’s case has been before the Board. In a May 21, 2003, decision, an Immigration Judge granted voluntary departure to the respondent after finding her ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229b(b)(1). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent failed to show that her removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative, as required. See section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on July 1, 2004. We denied previous motions to reopen on October 18, 2004; March 25, 2005, and June 15, 2005. The pending motion to reopen, filed on November 22, 2005, was filed late. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, the motion exceeds the numerical limitations for motions to reopen. Id. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent brings claims of ineffective assistance of counsel against the attorneys who represented her at the immigration hearing and concerning the first two motions filed in this case. However, the respondent submitted her April 25, 2005, motion, which we denied on June 15, 2005, pro se. She fails to state when she consulted current counsel. We find no basis to either equitably toll the motions deadline, or accept the motion under our sua sponte authority.
 
In any event, a respondent claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show prejudice resulting from her attorney’s failure. Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1185-86 (9th Cir. 2004); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent states that her attorney, Tony Guajardo, should have better prepared her case for cancellation of removal, and should have called her husband as a witness (Respondent’s Mot., at p. 13). However, the respondent fails to show what evidence was thereby omitted that would have caused the Immigration Judge to reach a different result concerning the cancellation application. The motion asserts that former counsel told the respondent’s husband not to submit an immediate relative visa petition. Id. Had the visa petition been filed, the Immigration Judge still would not have granted cancellation of removal to an individual with young, “easily adaptable” children (I.J. at 9).
 
*2 The respondent argues that her case should be reopened based on an October 6, 2005, memorandum by the DHS Immigration and Customs Enforcement Principal Legal Advisor (Respondent’s Mot., at Exh. 8). That memorandum concerns instances in which the DHS may exercise prosecutorial discretion to dismiss proceedings. That the DHS might dismiss a pending case in its discretion under certain circumstances provides no basis for reopening of these proceedings.
 
The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

IN RE: HERBERT GIOVANI PINEDA-MORALES
File: AXX XX9 301 - Los Angeles
March 14, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Enrique Arevalo, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated February 25, 1998. According to the regulations, a motion to reopen must be filed with the Board within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). In the instant case, the motion to reopen was required to have been filed no later than May 25, 1998. Id. The motion to reopen was not filed until January 31, 2006. Therefore, it is untimely. Id.; see also section 101(a)(47) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(47) (defining final order of deportation); Matter of Goolcharan, 23 I&N Dec. 5 (BIA 2001).
 
The respondent requests that the Board reopen proceedings sua sponte based upon exceptional circumstances. In Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), the Board held that its power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship. Matter of J-J-, supra. We not find that the moving party has demonstrated exceptional circumstances to warrant reopening sua sponte. Id. Here, the respondent contends that due to fraud relating to his 1996 motion to reopen, his current motion should not be time or numbers barred in light of Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000). We do not find the respondent’s reliance on Varela v. INS, supra, to be persuasive. We first note that the alien in Varela, supra, filed a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel within one month of finding out that his first motion to reopen was denied. Here, the record reflects that the respondent was represented by his current counsel as early as July 21, 1998 when his current counsel assisted in filing a visa petition on the respondent’s behalf (Form I-797C). Neither the respondent nor his counsel has adequately established why a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel was not filed in 1998 or why the respondent and his counsel waited over 6 years before filing the instant motion to reopen. Therefore, we do not find sufficient reason for equitably tolling the time or number limits set forth in the regulations. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897, 899 (9th Cir. 2003) (equitable tolling applies “when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering” the misconduct) (emphasis added).
 
*2 In addition, the alien in Varela, supra, complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), by filing a complaint with the California State Association and sending a letter to lawyer who had employed the notary. Here, while the respondent has submitted an affidavit and filed a complaint with the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office about the notary, the respondent did not file a complaint against the attorney employing the notary with the.California State Bar Association or provide evidence that the notary or the lawyer employing the notary was notified about the complaint. Therefore, the respondent has not substantially complied with the Lozada requirements.
 
As we find that the respondent has not met his burden to establish exceptional circumstances to warrant sua sponte reopening, we need not reach the respondent’s contention that he remains eligible for adjustment of status as he did not receive the oral advisements set forth in section 242B(e) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252B(e).
 
Accordingly, the motion reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Barr, Kaaren L., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James S. Yi,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 26, 2005. We agree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent’s September 7, 2005, conviction in the Circuit Court for the State of Oregon, Jackson County, pursuant to a plea of guilty of violating Or. Stat. § 165.022, which makes it a crime for an individual to possess a forged instrument, qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude, rendering the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal. See section 240A(b)(1)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(b)(1)(C)); see also Jordan v. DeGeorge, 341 U.S. 223, 232 (1951); Matter of Flores, 17 I&N Dec. 225, 228 (BIA 1980) (holding that intent to defraud involves moral turpitude). This Board has held that possession of an altered immigration document with knowledge that it was altered, but without its use or proof of an intent to use it unlawfully, is not a crime involving moral turpitude. See Matter of Serna, 20 I&N Dec. 579 (BIA 1992). In Matter of Serna, supra, we focused on the lack of use and lack of intent to use the altered document unlawfully as the distinguishing characteristics setting that crime apart from those that involve moral turpitude. However, we agree with the Immigration Judge that, in the instant case, because the 2 counts to which the respondent pled guilty both stated that the respondent possessed the forged instrument “with intent to utter the instrument,” the conviction documents establish that the respondent intended to use the forged instrument (Exh. 2). Furthermore, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not claimed any other form of relief from removal. Finally, we find no merit to the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by her prior attorney because he failed to pursue other avenues of relief from removal. See Matter of B-B, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998) (holding that the degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair). Moreover, we observe that the respondent has not met all of the requirements for establishing such a claim as set forth under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

File: AXX XX0 514 - Miami

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Linda Osberg-Braun, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Loren G. Coy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; remand
 
In an oral decision dated October 11, 2005, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged, and denied her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The respondent appealed from that decision, and subsequently filed a motion to remand. The motion will be granted, and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia, was admitted to the United states as a lawful permanent resident on January 30, 1972 (Exh. 1; Tr. at 73-74). She was convicted in the Circuit Court, Eleventh Judicial Circuit, in and for Dade County, Florida of petit larceny in violation of Florida Statute 812.014(3) on October 23, 1986, March 4, 1987, May 10, 1991, December 5, 1997, January 16, 1998, and May 6, 2003 (Exhs. 1, 4, 8; Tr. at 8-9, 13-14, 32-33, 53, 63-64, 67, 76-77; 79-81, 87-89). In addition, the respondent was arrested and charged with burglary of an occupied dwelling, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, and use of a firearm during the commission of a felony following an altercation with her ex-husband’s girlfriend on January 13, 1987 (Exh. 8; Tr. at 26-27, 81-85). Although the respondent was never prosecuted on these charges, the court issued a domestic violence injunction ordering her to stay away from the victim (Exh. 8; Tr. at 27, 85). The respondent was arrested for violating this injunction on February 5, 1992 (Exh. 8; Tr. at 86-87, 90).
 
In an October 11, 2005, decision, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged, and denied her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act in the exercise of discretion (I.J. at 5-7). Based on the evidence available at the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision, we agree that the respondent did not merit a grant of cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion. We find that the Immigration Judge properly noted the respondent’s positive factors, but agree that these did not outweigh her criminal history and her failure to show genuine rehabilitation for her criminal record. See Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998); Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581 (BIA 1978).
 
During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand the record for further proceedings based upon her claim that she received ineffective assistance of counsel, and was deprived of due process because of faulty equipment used during her video conference hearing. Although the respondent submitted evidence showing that she complied with the requirements enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), she failed to establish that she suffered any prejudice due to her former counsel’s actions. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 533 (BIA 2003). The respondent maintains that her former attorney erred in failing to apply for asylum and a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). Strategic decisions on how best to proceed in a case are not necessarily grounds for ineffective assistance of counsel. Further, the respondent has offered no evidence in her motion to establish that she would have prevailed on these applications. Finally, we find unpersuasive the respondent’s assertion that she was deprived of due process as a result of faulty equipment used during the video conference hearing. The respondent failed to raise any concerns or objections regarding the equipment during the hearing, and has not identified any errors or prejudice flowing from the alleged technical difficulties.
 
*2 In her motion, the respondent also maintains that newly obtained evidence establishes that she is entitled to a grant of cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion. She suggests that she may be suffering from kleptomania, and has submitted various letters and articles in support of her claim. Because there has been no formal diagnosis of kleptomania in this case, we find that the evidence pertaining to this disorder is immaterial. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Finally, the respondent reported that her 87-year-old United States citizen mother was discharged from a mental hospital on October 7, 2005, and explained that she is suffering from the advanced stages of Alzheimer’s disease and is in need of constant care. She submitted medical evidence from the hospital confirming that her mother “requires 24 hour supervision to be safe in the community,” as well as affidavits from family members explaining that the respondent is the only person capable of providing the required care. We agree with the respondent that this evidence regarding her mother’s current medical condition is material in the balancing of the equities in this case. Consequently, we conclude that it is appropriate to remand the case to the Immigration Judge for consideration of this additional evidence.
 
On remand, the parties will be allowed an opportunity to present evidence regarding whether the respondent merits cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act as a matter of discretion. We note that the Immigration Judge’s decision should include clear and complete findings of fact that are supported by the record and are in compliance with controlling law. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

File: AXX XX6 959 - Hartford

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dr. T.H. Martland
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On October 27, 2005, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal because she had waived the right to appeal. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). The respondent filed a motion to reconsider, on November 29, 2005. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent now claims that former counsel pressured her into waiving her right to appeal. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001) (a party wishing to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or an appeal directly with the Board). However, despite making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making such a claim. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108, 110 (2d Cir. 1993). These cases require that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that she was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Zheng v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 409 F.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2005). In this case, the respondent’s affidavit is vague as to the agreement between herself and counsel, the attorney has not been allowed to respond, and no bar complaint has been filed. The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

IN RE: HERODE PIERRE
File: AXX XX5 606 - Boston
February 28, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David McHaffey, Esq.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated September 27, 2005. This case was last before the Board on December 8, 2005, when we denied a motion to reconsider filed by the respondent and his former counsel. On December 27, 2005, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen proceedings, asserting that his former representative afforded him ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Specifically, the respondent contends that his former counsel failed to contact and/or subpoena his ex-wife to testify about the bona fides of their marriage during the proceedings below despite his repeated requests that she do so, and did not have his former wife’s affidavit notarized. In support of this contention the respondent has submitted an affidavit outlining his complaints against his former counsel, sent the same to her, filed a complaint with the appropriate state bar authority, and has demonstrated that he suffered prejudice as a result of her actions. He has also provided a notarized affidavit from his former wife stating that she informed his former counsel she was willing to testify on his behalf, and that she had been willing to sign a notarized statement but was not asked to do so.
 
We note that this Board questioned the authenticity of the non-notarized affidavit from the respondent’s ex-wife in light of other evidence of record, and found denial warranted given the lack of apparently readily available corroborative evidence. That such evidence was provided in conjunction with the respondent’s motion to reconsider, filed by former counsel, further underscores her deficient performance. In sum, we find that as the respondent has met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), reopening is warranted. On remand the respondent should be permitted to submit any evidence relevant to his request for a waiver of the requirement to file a joint petition, and his application for adjustment of status.
 
Accordingly, the motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings in accordance with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Elizabeth Krukova, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on December 12, 2005, at which time the Board denied the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion to remand proceedings. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
An alien may seek to reopen proceedings based upon new and previously unavailable evidence See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2; Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). A party seeking to reopen proceedings “bears a heavy burden” as the regulations “plainly disfavor” such motions. INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 110 (1988). In his motion to reopen, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from his former attorney. The respondent argues that his former attorney failed to file a proper motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge and failed to adequately argue his case on appeal before the Board. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen. The respondent submits a letter to his former attorney and a copy of the complaint he filed against his attorney with the Virginia State Bar. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent argues that his former counsel filed a deficient motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge on December 8, 2004. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2-3. However, the evidence in the record indicates that the respondent was not represented by counsel at the time he filed this letter with the Immigration Judge seeking to reopen his proceedings. See Respondent’s December 8, 2004, letter (signed by the respondent); Respondent’s Motion to Remand, Exh. E (sworn statement by the respondent indicating that he wrote the letter to the Immigration Judge seeking reopening of his proceedings and that he hired his former attorney after he received the July 11, 2005, briefing schedule by the Board). Furthermore, the respondent’s former attorney filed a detailed brief and motion with the Board. We decline to reopen proceedings based on respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent argues that he misread his hearing notice and erroneously thought his December 1, 2004, hearing was at a later date. This explanation was considered by the Immigration Judge and he concluded that the respondent’s explanation did not amount to “exceptional circumstances.” See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). We observe that the term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). This Board, in our December 12, 2005, decision, also considered the respondent’s explanation and agreed with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s misunderstanding of the hearing date did not amount to exceptional circumstances. We find no reason to disturb that conclusion.
 
*2 In addition, the respondent argues his case should be reopened because he has potential avenues of adjustment through his legal permanent resident fiancé or his employer. First, there is no evidence that the respondent has an approved employment-based visa. In addition, there is no evidence establishing that the respondent is currently married and that an immediate-relative visa petition has been filed on his behalf. See Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). The respondent has not demonstrated that he is currently eligible for relief from removal. Accordingly, we conclude that reopening proceedings in not warranted.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sonia H. Parras Konrad, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Arrived at time or place not designated by the Attorney General
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 6, 2005. In his decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s “motion to reopen under ¿the Violence Against Women Actº (VAWA) and ineffective assistance of counsel.” In that regard, he found that he lacked jurisdiction to entertain the respondent’s applications for relief under VAWA, either in the form of a self-petition or a U visa. With regard to the respondent’s motion to reopen for VAWA cancellation of removal, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent failed to comply with any of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. On appeal, the respondent maintains that she is eligible for protection under VAWA and that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal will be sustained, in part, and the record will be remanded for the Immigration Judge to adjudicate the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal pursuant to VAWA.
 
The Immigration Judge properly found that he did not have jurisdiction over the respondent’s VAWA self-petition or U visa and that he only had jurisdiction to adjudicate the respondent’s application for VAWA cancellation of removal. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.20. Additionally, he properly looked to Matter of Lozada, supra, to determine if the respondent should be excused from not having previously sought an application for VAWA cancellation of removal. Contrary to the Immigration Judge’s findings, we find that the respondent has minimally complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of Counsel.1 Specifically, we will accept the respondent’s counsel’s letter with the counsel’s signature and the bar complaint form referring to it, reflecting service on prior counsel as well, for purposes of Matter of Lozada, supra. However, the respondent’s compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, should have been better explained by the respondent, and might well have avoided denial of the motion below. For example, the respondent should have filed an independent affidavit in her own words setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with her former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken by her former counsel and what representations her former counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard as required by Matter of Lozada, supra. Additionally, she should have more clearly demonstrated that her former counsel was informed of the allegations against him as required by Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent, however did file significant evidence in the record to prove her prima facie eligibility for protection in the form of cancellation of removal pursuant to the VAWA, thereby demonstrating that she was actually prejudiced by the actions of her previous counsel. See Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 1984). Finally, we will vacate the Immigration Judge’s prior order granting the respondent the privilege of voluntary departure because that order resulted from the ineffective assistance of prior counsel. This extinguishes the concerns arising from the respondent’s prior acceptance of voluntary departure and subsequent failure to depart. Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s appeal will be sustained. The motion to reopen will be granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for him to adjudicate the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal pursuant to the VAWA.
 
*2 Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is sustained. The motion to reopen is granted. The Immigration Judge’s March 22, 2005, order is vacated, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Arthur Linderman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa Golub
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of Colombia, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his motion to reopen. We have jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. The record is remanded.
 
The record reflects that on July 20, 2005, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal, ordered his removal from the United States, but allowed him the opportunity to depart the United States voluntarily. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on August 18, 2005. Therein, it was alleged that the respondent had hired an individual to represent him who may not have been an attorney. That individual supposedly prepared the respondent’s cancellation of removal application, but did not appear at the hearing. According to the respondent’s affidavit, he was informed just prior to the hearing that Ana Reyes could not attend the hearing because she was on vacation. The respondent appeared without counsel, his application was denied, and he later found Ana Reyes in her office shortly after the hearing. The respondent argued in his motion to reopen that he was the victim of negligent representation, and wished an opportunity for a new hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion on September 2, 2005, and this appeal followed.
 
In considering this appeal, we note our decision in Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994). Therein, we indicated that when a motion to reopen deportation proceedings is denied, the Immigration Judge must identify and fully explain the reasons for such decision; otherwise, the parties are deprived of a fair opportunity to contest the Immigration Judge’s determination on appeal, and the Board is unable to meaningfully exercise its responsibility of reviewing the decision in light of the arguments advanced on appeal. See generally also Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s Immigration Judge’s two-line decision fails to even mention the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, and merely states that the respondent failed to present supporting documents in support of his application for cancellation of removal.
 
Accordingly, we find it necessary to remand the record for inclusion of an appropriate decision by the Immigration Judge. On remand, the Immigration Judge shall address whether the respondent satisfied the requirements for proving that he was the victim of attorney negligence as contemplated under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent and the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service, should be served with a copy of the decision and should thereafter be given an opportunity to submit briefs in accordance with the regulations. The record should then be forwarded to the Board for further consideration.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on October 17, 2005, when we adopted and affirmed the decision of an Immigration Judge dated April 11, 2005, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen deportation proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of deportation entered in her case on April 17, 1992, for failing to demonstrate reasonable cause for her failure to appear at her scheduled hearing.

The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of her former counsel. The motion will be denied.
 
Even if we were to find the respondent has generally complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 627 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), regarding ineffective assistance of counsel claims, and accepting her allegations as true, it does not alter any aspect of the Board’s decision. The respondent argues that her counsel was obligated to file a timely petition for review before the united States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and provided ineffective assistance when he failed to do so. We note, however, the petition for review that her attorney failed to timely file was with the Third Circuit and not with the Board. Consequently, this alleged ineffectiveness, if true, occurred after the Board rendered its October 17, 2005, decision. We find no evidence of irregularity or Board error regarding the service of our October 17, 2005, decision. Thus, any error before the Third Circuit by her counsel does not implicate an action by the Board since the Board made no error as a result of her counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness on this ground. Moreover, the respondent can show no prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The Board can provide no remedy for any alleged ineffectiveness that arose after the Board rendered its decision. The proper forum over her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel lies with the Third Circuit and not with the Board. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN RE: RODRIGO IVAN GRIJALVA-ROJAS
File: AXX XX6 322 - Honolulu
February 10, 2006
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Edgardo Quintanilla, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
June Ito,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
In a decision dated August 23, 2005, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, and this appeal followed. We note that the respondent appeared before an Immigration Judge on November 5, 1990, and was allowed to depart the United States voluntarily by May 5, 1991. On August 15, 2005, he filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge arguing that the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (“Service”), now the Department of Homeland Security, may have arrested him and placed him in deportation proceedings based upon his Hispanic features, and not on account of evidence that he was in the United States illegally. He further argues that his former counsel was negligent because he did not attempt to have the proceedings terminated against him. In denying the motion, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not proven ineffective assistance of counsel because none of the procedural requirements were satisfied.
 
Section 1003.23(b)(4) of 8 Code of Federal Regulations provides that “except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings (whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge) and that motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later.” We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to prove that he complied with the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel because none of the procedural requirements were satisfied. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Even if he had, the respondent having waited 15 years to seek reopening is prima facie evidence of his failure to pursue reopening with due diligence. We will therefore not toll the statute of limitations for seeking such. Consequently, we find that the motion was filed untimely before the Immigration Judge.
 
On appeal, the respondent requests that the Board reopen these proceedings sua sponte presumably based upon his contention that he is not deportable because of the illegality of his arrest. Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000). The Board has held that we will not consider on appeal issues which were conceded at the hearing. See Matter of Pichardo, 21 I&N Dec. 330 (BIA 1996). When an alien concedes that he is removable or deportable, he is generally not permitted to later argue that he is not. See Matter of Pichardo, supra. In Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), we emphasized the importance of the time and numerical limits on motions to reopen, noting the need to discourage dilatory motions and Congress’ mandate that we issue regulations to do so. We recognized, however, that we retained “limited discretionary powers” to reopen or reconsider cases on our own motion. Id. at 984. We cautioned though that such powers should be exercised only in “exceptional situations.” Id. We further indicated that it is the respondent’s burden to demonstrate that such a situation exists. Id. at 984-85.
 
*2 In the instant case, the respondent does not allege that he is legally present in this country, or that relief from deportation exists. Instead, he asks the Board to either reopen or terminate these proceedings sua sponte based solely on his allegation that he was arrested without reasonable suspicion for being in the United States illegally. We have reviewed the documents submitted by the respondent to support his argument. Those documents state that the Service received information from two independent sources that the respondent’s former employer was hiring illegal Mexican workers (See respondent’s Exh. E). That information was also corroborated by the Hawaii County Police in Hilo. Id. The document further indicates that with the consent of an undetermined individual, Service officers questioned the workers, and determined that the respondent was a citizen of Ecuador, and illegal in this country. Id. The Record of Deportable Alien further states that the respondent was questioned about his immigration status, admitted that he was not legally in the United States, and he stated that his employer knew of his illegal status in this country.
 
The “exclusionary rule” arose in the context of criminal proceedings and requires a court to suppress evidence that is the fruit of an unlawful arrest or of other official conduct which violates the Fourth Amendment. It is well-established that the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is not applicable in deportation proceedings. See Matter of Cervantes, 21 I&N Dec. 351, 353 (BIA 1996). However, the use of the exclusionary rule might apply in deportation proceedings in the presence of egregious circumstances which transgress the notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the probative value of the evidence in question. See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1051, n.5. (1984). The use of this narrow exception to the rule that the exclusionary rule does not apply to deportation proceedings has been limited. See, e.g., Orhorhaghe v. INS, 38 F.3d 488 (9th Cir. 1994); Gonzalez-Rivera v. INS, 22 F.3d 144 (9th Cir. 1994) (both cases involved conduct of government officers which was deemed to be racially discriminatory). We note that “¿oºne who raises the claim questioning the legality of the evidence must come forward with proof establishing a prima facie case before the government will be called on to assume the burden of justifying the manner in which it obtained the evidence.” Matter of Burgos, 15 I&N Dec. 278, 279 (BIA 1975); see also Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980); Matter of Wong, 13 I&N Dec. 820, 821-22 (BIA 1971); Matter of Tang, 13 I&N Dec. 691, 692 (BIA 1971).
 
*3 In the instant case, notwithstanding that the respondent has the burden of showing egregious government action, we cannot find any evidence of government wrongdoing. The Service was notified from reliable sources of the respondent’s illegal presence in this country, questioned him, and he admitted to such. We find no error on behalf of the Service, and see no reason to sua sponte exercise our authority to reopen or terminate these proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lawrence Gatei
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated September 13, 2005. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen based on his prior counsel’s ineffective assistance before the Immigration Judge below. Reopening or remanding a case based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved applicant setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the applicant in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) evidence that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent has supported his motion with numerous affidavits, exhibits, and has otherwise complied with Board precedent, insofar as he has taken the steps necessary to proffer an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and has also shown sufficient prejudice as a result of the claimed insufficiently competent legal representation previously. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the respondent’s motion, although we note the points raised by the DHS regarding the defects in the respondent’s first motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge. In sum, based on the supporting documentation presented by the respondent, as well as the compliance with Board precedent, coupled with a showing of prejudice, we will grant the respondent’s motion.
 
Accordingly, the motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN RE: GINA SOTOMAYOR DE CASTRO
File: A79 706 448 - Newark
February 8, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert Frank, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa M. Golub
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
In a decision dated August 19, 2003, the respondent was ordered removed in absentia for failing to appear for her hearing on that date. She filed a motion to reopen on December 2, 2003, seeking to rescind the in absentia order. In her affidavit, she averred that Edwin Rivera, an individual who portrayed himself as an attorney, advised her that she would not have to appear for her hearing because he had requested a continuance. On December 22, 2003, an Immigration Judge denied the motion. The respondent has appealed. On appeal, she has submitted additional evidence, which we will construe as a motion to remand. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4). The appeal will be sustained and the motion will be granted.
 
In her denial, the Immigration Judge first found “no evidence that Edwin Rivera held himself out to Respondent as an attorney licensed to practice law” (I.J. at 1). However, with her motion, the respondent submitted numerous brochures and business cards in which Mr. Rivera represented himself to be an attorney.1 The Immigration Judge then noted that there was no evidence that Mr. Rivera had agreed to represent the respondent, given that there was no attorney or representative of record at the time of the in absentia hearing. However, the Immigration Judge ignored, the other evidence submitted by the respondent, including the receipts of payment to Mr. Rivera for legal services, and correspondence to the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) from Mr. Rivera regarding the respondent’s case (Motion, tabs A and C).
 
The Immigration Judge also found the respondent’s “delay” in filing her motion to be “unacceptable” (I.J. at 1-2). However, the motion was filed approximately 3 1/2 months after the issuance of the Immigration Judge’s order, which is well within the 180 days allotted by Statute. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C).
 
Finally, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not satisfied all of the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, on appeal, the respondent has provided evidence that she has informed Mr. Rivera of the allegations and that she has filed a complaint with the Bronx District Attorney (Appeal Br., tabs A and C). Furthermore, the respondent has submitted a response from Mr. Rivera, in which he admits that he advised the respondent not to appear for her hearings (Appeal Br., tab B). She has also included newspaper articles reporting that the Attorney General of New York has filed a lawsuit against Mr. Rivera for defrauding immigrants (Appeal Br., tab D). The DHS has not opposed the submission of any of this evidence. Moreover, the Board recently remanded the records of the respondent’s children (A79 706 449 and A95 823 255), based on nearly identical facts. In light of these circumstances, we find it appropriate to remand the record for consideration of the evidence. On remand, the respondent may present her request for consolidation of the cases to the Immigration Judge.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

File: AXX XX1 449 - York
February 6, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marcia Binder Ibrahim, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kent J. Frederick
Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal will be dismissed. The transcript of proceedings shows that the respondent, by counsel, waived appeal (Tr. at 6). The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had waived appeal. On October 1, 2004, the respondent nevertheless filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) argues that the appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, due to the fact that the respondent waived appeal.
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(G) (summary dismissal of appeal appropriate where appeal is barred based on waiver of right to appeal). The respondent argues that his attorney provided bad advice, and should have not conceded that the respondent was subject to removal as charged, and this led to his accepting the waiver. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001) (a party wishing to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or an appeal directly with the Board). However, despite making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has complied with none of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making such a claim. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98, 106 (3d Cir. 2005) (discussing procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel to the Board). Among other things, there is no affidavit from the respondent setting out his claims. The assertion in the motion that the respondent intends to comply with the procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel only if the case is first reopened, see Respondent’s Mot., at p. 7, is insufficient as a reason to excuse the failure to comply with the Lozada requirements. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Perez, John D., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa M. Golub,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURLAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 10, 2005. The record reflects that respondent is a minor. He was ordered to be removed in proceedings conducted in absentia. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen. He stated that miscommunication between his mother and his counsel caused his absence. He claimed that exceptional circumstances warrant reopening. In denying the respondent’s motion, the Immigration Judge stated that the respondent’s mother was instructed to appear on the respondent’s behalf, and that his mother’s failure to appear waived the respondent’s right to contest his removal. We find that the Immigration Judge failed to address the reasons the respondent provided for his failure to appear at the hearing. See Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994) (the Immigration Judge’s decision must identify and fully explain the reasons for denial of a motion to reopen immigration proceedings). Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge to further consider the motion and to enter a new decision which explains the reason for such decision. On remand, the respondent’s counsel shall supplement the record with his affidavit and an affidavit from the respondent’s mother. If the respondent is asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must provide a complaint and other evidence to meet the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.

File: AXX XX3 599 - Dallas
January 31, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicolas Olano, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
In a decision dated September 2, 2005, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen an order of removal entered in absentia on May 9, 2005. The record reflects that on May 6, 2005, the respondent filed a motion for a change of venue with the Immigration Judge. Therein, the respondent indicated through former counsel, Alfonso Oviedo-Reyes, that she conceded removability, and requested that venue be changed to Miami, Florida. She indicated that she wished to be considered for adjustment of status in Miami. According to the respondent, it was financially difficult for her and her witnesses to appear in Dallas, and her counsel had prior engagements making it impossible for him to travel there. The Immigration Judge did not rule on the motion prior to the hearing, but ordered the respondent removed for failing to appear for her May 9, 2005, hearing. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, but it was denied. This appeal followed.
 
On appeal, the respondent now insinuates through her above captioned counsel that proceedings should be reopened because she was the victim of ineffective representation by her prior counsel. The respondent repeatedly cites the Board’s decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). We therefore presume that she believes that her former counsel was negligent in these proceedings. We shall address the merits of her contention.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
*2 It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553. (BIA 2003). The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
In the instant case, counsel for the respondent has informed prior counsel of the allegations of negligence, and prior counsel has responded. However, the respondent has failed to submit a complaint against former counsel with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Even if the Board overlooked that flaw, the respondent has failed to explain how former counsel was negligent in his representation of the respondent. In fact, former counsel indicates in his reply to the negligence allegation that he represented the respondent competently. Upon review, we cannot identify any example of attorney negligence, or determine that the actions of the respondent’s former counsel caused her failure to appear for the hearing. We therefore dismiss this aspect of the appeal.
 
The respondent further vaguely argues that “exceptional circumstances” existed to excuse her failure to appear for the hearing. We note that the motion to change venue was filed only three days prior to the hearing. The respondent should therefore have presumed that the request may not have been adjudicated before the respondent’s hearing, and made arrangements to be present. The Immigration Judge’s decision carefully analyzes this aspect of the reopening claim, and we affirm the Immigraiion Judge’s determination on this issue for the reasons provided therein.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: ALFONSO RIGOBERTO ORELLANA-AGUILAR
File: AXX XX4 980 - San Antonio
January 31, 2006
 
IN DEPOTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Roberto Hernandez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anibal Martinez,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s June 27, 2005, decision to deny his motion to reopen an order of deportation that was entered in absentia on January 19, 1988. The respondent argues in his January 26, 2005, motion to reopen filed before the Immigration Judge that the Notice of Hearing was incorrectly sent to Jose Salvador Tellez, Esquire, because Mr. Tellez was never legally authorized to represent him in these deportation proceedings. The Immigration Judge found, however that counsel had filed a Notice of Appearance on behalf of the respondent, had acted as his representative before the Immigration Court, and even filed a motion to withdraw as the respondent’s counsel. The Immigration Judge further found that the respondent had received adequate notice of his hearing through counsel, denied the motion, and this appeal followed.
 
On appeal, the respondent no longer argues that Mr. Tellez was not authorized to represent him. Instead, he argues that Mr.Tellez sent nonce of the hearing to an incorrect address, 116th Bushwick, Apt. #2, Brooklyn, New York 11206. He indicates that he notified counsel that he had moved to 31 Montrose Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11206, and Mr. Tellez was apparently negligent for sending him notice at an address that he should have known was outdated. The respondent does not explain why he waited so many years to check his immigration status.
 
We note that in Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993), this Board held that in all deportation cases where the Notice of Hearing for which the alien failed to appear was served after June 13, 1992, an alien must satisfy the standard for reopening cited in sections 242B(c)(3)(A) and 242B(f)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3)(A) and (f)(2). If an alien was served a Notice of Hearing prior to June 13, 1992, he must satisfy the standards for reopening set forth in section 242(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b). Under section 242(b) of the Act, the alien must establish that he had reasonable cause for his absence from the proceedings. Matter of Ruiz, 20 I&N Dec. 91 (BIA 1989); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988). On the issue of timeliness of the motion, we note that in Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155 (BIA 1999), the Board held that the regulation at 8 C.F.R.§ 3.2(b)(4)(iii) (1998) imposes no time or numerical limitation on aliens seeking to reopen deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act.
 
*2 We initially find that the Immigration Court did not err by sending the Notice of Hearing to prior Counsel. A Notice of Hearing sent to an alien’s attorney of record is proper notice. See 8 C.F.R. § 292.5. The question remaining is whether the respondent’s failure to receive notice of his hearing was caused by the negligence of Mr. Tellez.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
In the instant case, the respondent has not complied with any of the procedural requirements for proving that Mr. Tellez was negligent by possibly sending the respondent notice of the hearing to an incorrect address. Having failed to do so, we cannot find that he had reasonable cause for missing his hearing by virtue of attorney negligence.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gonzalez, Ricardo
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dyann Bernstein,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent failed to appear for her removal hearing on July 13, 2005. She was ordered be removed in proceedings conducted in absentia. The respondent submitted a timely motion to reopen, claiming that her counsel failed to inform her of the date of the hearing. The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the notice of hearing was properly served on the respondent’s counsel of record, and that the respondent has not presented a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that is compliant with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). He appropriately denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. We are not persuaded by the respondent’s assertion on appeal she did not receive proper notice because neither her counsel or the Immigration Court informed her of the date of her hearing. Notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. § 3.26(C)(2); Matter of Barocio; 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985). We note that, on appeal, the respondent still has not met the requirements to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, supra. We find no merit in her contention that she was denied an opportunity to present evidence, or that the in absentia order of removal was not properly served. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: ANABELE CHAVEZ
File: AXX XX8 207 - Los Angeles
January 27, 2006
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gabriella Navarro Busch, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
The record reflects that the respondent was ordered deported in absentia on December 22, 1999. She filed a motion to reopen with an Immigration Judge on January 20, 2000. Therein, the respondent’s former counsel indicated that he was at fault for the respondent missing her hearing. He indicated that he recorded in his schedule book that the hearing would be held on December 27, 2000, and instructed the respondent to attend that day. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on April 27, 2000, finding that the circumstances described did not constitute an “exceptional circumstance” as contemplated under section 240(e)(1) of the Act. No appeal of that decision was submitted to the Board.
 
On August 19, 2005, the respondent, through new counsel, filed with the Immigration Judge a second motion to reopen arguing that the respondent’s failure to appear for her hearing was caused by ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The motion was denied on September 2, 2005, and this appeal followed.
 
We note initially that the Immigration Judge’s decision on the second motion to reopen is cursory, and does not meaningfully address the issues raised by the respondent. Normally, the Board would remand the record to require the Immigration Judge to fully explain the reasons for a decision. See Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994) (holding that when a motion to reopen deportation proceedings is denied, the Immigration Judge must identify and fully explain the reasons for such decision; otherwise, the parties are deprived of a fair opportunity to contest the Immigration Judge’s determination on appeal, and the Board is unable to meaningfully exercise its responsibility of reviewing the decision in light of the arguments advanced on appeal). However, inasmuch as the Immigration Judge carefully detailed his reasons for denying reopening in his April 27, 2000, decision, we will refrain from remanding the record based upon an insufficient Immigration Judge decision.
 
The issue for the Board to resolve is whether the respondent established that reopening of these proceedings is appropriate based upon attorney negligence. We initially note that a request for rescission of an order of removal based on “exceptional circumstances” must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The respondent’s second motion was clearly filed more than 180 days after the order of deportation was entered, and is untimely.
 
*2 We further note that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004) (alien must show outcome might have been affected). The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998):
 
In addition, we have considered that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that an alien need not fulfill all the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, to assert claim of ineffective assistance of counsel when the record reflects a clear and obvious case such. See Castillo-Peres v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that attorney’s failure to timely file a suspension of deportation application was negligence). See also Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331 (9th Cir. 2000), Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
In the instant case, the respondent appears to have established compliance with the above procedural requirements, and has shown a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel. On appeal, the respondent acknowledges that the second motion to reopen was untimely filed, but requests that the Board equitably toll the 180-day period for seeking reopening.
 
In denying the second motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge indicated that the respondent’s motion was number-barred from consideration. We note that the time and number restrictions set forth in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b) do not apply to motions to reopen in absentia orders of deportation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(D). Consequently, the respondent’s motion is not numerically-barred, but may still be time-barred.
 
*3 Turning to the equitable tolling issue, in Fajardo v. INS, 300 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2002), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the limitation period on motions to reopen based on exceptional circumstances must be tolled until a petitioner was aware of the harm resulting from an attorney’s misconduct. In the instant case, the respondent was aware on December 27, 2000, that she may have been the victim of attorney negligence when she learned that she was ordered deported in absentia on December 22, 2000. While we recognize that the respondent may have trusted former counsel to rectify her deportation order, and thus allow her an opportunity to do so, we cannot ignore that the second motion to reopen was not filed until August 19, 2005. Having waited for such an extensive period to seek reopening based upon attorney negligence is indicative of the respondent’s failure to pursue her case with due diligence. We therefore cannot equitably toll the statute of limitations for reopening, and find that her second motion to reopen was untimely.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gary Silbiger, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reconsider
 
*1 In an order entered on October 4, 2005, we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider our order. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). A motion to reconsider must assert that, at the time of our previous decision, an error was made. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The very nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard. Id.
 
The respondent has presented no persuasive evidence or argument that we committed error of law or fact in denying the motion to reopen. Contrary to the contentions in the motion to reconsider, the motion to reopen was untimely. The adoption of December 31, 2004, as the date that “fraud” was discovered, so as to invoke “equitable tolling” for a motion filed on March 31, 2005, is not persuasive when it is clear that the respondent had concluded that his first counsel committed ineffective assistance of counsel by mid-2003, and when current counsel was already exploring the issues as early as October 22, 2004. We also note that documents complying with this Board’s Lozada requirements were not filed until April 2005 and were clearly untimely, even though they were headed as part of a “supplementary motion.”
 
Further, as the Immigration Judge correctly noted in an addendum to his July 22, 2003, decision, the respondent has failed to prove that former counsel committed prejudicial error. The motion does not persuade us that our decision to deny reopening was based on error, and there is, consequently, no basis for reconsideration of our order, in the absence of persuasive evidence of error.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

File: AXX XX9 698 - Boston

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mario Bozza, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The motion is denied. This case was last before us on August 2, 2005, when we upheld an Immigration Judge’s denial of adjustment of status and denied the respondent’s appellate claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.¿FN1º The respondent’s motion to reopen, filed with a new Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) from the same purported spouse, largely puts forth the same arguments an evidence that were part of his previously denied appeal. The respondent has made no attempt to cure the defects, as previously noted by this Board, in his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The unsupported assertion by the respondent’s current attorney, that the respondent misunderstood some of the questions asked at the merits hearing, is not evidence. Matter of S-M-, 22 I&N Dec. 49 (BIA 1998). As noted in our prior decision, a significant credibility problem arose with respect discrepant witness statements as to who was the best man at the respondent’s wedding. The current attorney’s own assertion that the respondent misunderstood questions about this because Moroccan weddings do not have a best man, is not evidence. Id. Morever, this assertion is contradicted by a new written statement, submitted with the motion, from an individual named Khalid Abboud, who again claims—still in contrast to previous statements by other witnesses—to have been the best man at the wedding. This resolves none of the discrepancies in this case.
 
We previously rejected the generalized explanation that the credibility problems could be explained by the respondent’s nervousness at the hearing. Moreover, this suggestion does not account for the other previously noted discrepancies among the other witnesses. Many of the reasons which the Immigration Judge gave for finding that the respondent and the supposed spouse lacked credibility remain unchallenged. The new evidence, including photocopies of recent third-party written statement—which are neither sworn nor notarized—does not resolve the conflicting witness accounts previously noted by the Immigration Judge and this Board. The new written statements purport to contain, inter alia, some personal opinions from various individuals about whether the respondent’s marriage might be bona fide, but no explanation has been provided why such evidence could not have been submitted sooner. The written statements and other materials submitted with the motion are essentially cumulative of what was already of record. Thus, the new evidence is unpersuasive. Notwithstanding the respondent’s apparent argument to the contrary, the couple’s conduct, before and after marriage, is relevant to determining their intent at the time of marriage. See Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604 (1953); Matter of Soriano, 19 I&N Dec. 764, 765-66 (BIA 1988). We note that these considerations, for purposes of this case, relate to whether the respondent put forth credible evidence and whether he therefore would merit relief in the exercise of discretion. In this regard, we further note that a number of the discrepancies involve what supposedly happened on the day of the wedding. As we indicated in our prior decision, for the reasons stated therein, we would deny adjustment of status in the exercise of discretion.

IN RE: BENSABEUR BELHADS MOKHTAR
File: A73 075 848 - Philadelphia
January 20, 2006
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bradford Bernstein, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has requested that the Board reconsider its decision dated November 10, 2005, to deny a request to reopen an order of deportation entered in absentia. The motion is denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must state the reasons upon which the motion is based and be supported by such precedent decisions as are pertinent. There is no requirement for allegations of new facts or even new precedent. 8 C.F.R. § 103.5 (2001); Sanchez v. INS, 707 F.2d 1523, 1529 (D.C. Cir. 1983); Chudshevid v. INS, 641 F.2d 780, 784 (9th Cir. 1981); see Artukovic v. INS, 693 F.2d 894, 898 (9th Cir. 1982). The motion to reconsider is generally used to question a decision for alleged errors of fact or law. Sanchez v. INS, supra. It is a request that the decision be reexamined in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked. See Chudshevid v. INS, supra; Hurwitz, Motions Practice Before the Board of Immigration Appeals, 20 San Diego L. Rev. 79 (1982), reprinted in 6 Immigration and Nationality L. Rev. 472 (1984); see also Matter of Cerna, supra.
 
In our prior order, the Board found that the respondent failed to establish that it was appropriate to grant an untimely motion to reopen based upon a showing that the 180-day period for reopening should be equitably tolled based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. We further noted therein that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. See also Ponce-Leiva v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 369 (3d Cir. 2003) (concluding that the three-prong test is a reasonable exercise of the Board’s discretion); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). In addition, we noted that the Third Circuit Court of Appeals specifically requires that the party alleging ineffective counsel provide such counsel with an opportunity to respond. See Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 132 (3d Cir. 2001).
 
*2 We have again reviewed the record, and still find that the respondent has failed to satisfy the procedural requirements set forth above. The respondent has not submitted an affidavit in which he provides his version of what his former attorney, Laura Weiss, allegedly told him. He also has not provided any proof that he had a business relationship with Laura Weiss, and that she is even an attorney. The respondent indicates through counsel that Laura Weiss practiced in Pennsylvania in 1995, but does not indicate what city, or how he located her. The respondent indicates he tried to find her on the Internet, but could not find an attorney of that name in Pennsylvania. He did not indicate whether he tried to find her under any other states attorney records. We further note that Laura Weiss likely had a phone listing, and the respondent has not indicated whether he tried to locate her through phone company or Post Office records. Moreover, the respondent indicates that Laura Weiss told him in 1995 that he need not appear in court because his deportation case would be terminated. The respondent was therefore under an obligation to verify that such occurred. The respondent’s having waited 7 years to check on his immigration status after having been served with the Order to Show Cause shows his lack of due diligence in protecting his immigration rights. For these reasons, and those expressed in our prior order, we see no error in our prior decision not to reopen these proceedings. It follows that the respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: SALVADOR ORTEGA-SANDOVAL
File: AXX XX2 016 - San Pedro
January 20, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Murray D. Hilts, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a timely motion seeking to have the Board reconsider its October 14, 2005, decision. Our earlier decision denied an untimely motion to reopen which sought to have the Board reconsider its August 29, 2003, decision dismissing the respondent’s appeal as untimely. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
We denied the motion to reopen, as it contained no legal argument, but rather several “Attachments”, including the respondent’s affidavit. The respondent contends that the motion was among his earlier submission; this is not the case. However, we will reconsider the reasons for our earlier denial, based on the respondent’s explanation that his attorney’s office made a clerical error in omitting the actual motion to reopen. Upon reconsideration, however, the motion to reopen will again be denied.
 
The respondent blames his former attorney for filing an untimely appeal. However, the respondent’s affidavit does not show that he made sufficient effort to keep in touch with counsel concerning the case from the time of the Immigration Judge’s January 10, 2002, decision, until the respondent says he learned of the Board’s decision 3 years later, in March, 2005 (Respondent’s Affidavit). An individual seeking to rely upon “equitable tolling” of a filing deadline must show that he has acted with due diligence. See Albillo-De Leon v. Gonzales, 410 F.3d 1090, 1099-1100 (9th Cir. 2005); Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir. 2004); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir.2003). The respondent does not make this showing.
 
In any event, a respondent claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show prejudice resulting from his attorney’s failure. Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1189 (9th Cir. 2004); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62; (BIA 2003), Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for relief from removal based on his conviction of an aggravated felony. The respondent argues that the respondent was eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(e). This is incorrect. The United States Supreme Court held that the restrictions on section 212(c) relief do not apply retroactively to aliens who pled guilty to offenses prior to April 24, 1996. See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). The respondent was found to have committed an aggravated felony based on his 2001 conviction for possession of heroin, after a previous conviction, and relief under 212(c) of the Act was therefore unavailable even under that court ruling. See I.J. at 3. The respondent does not otherwise suggest that the Immigration Judge erred in denying relief.
 
*2 The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Xia Zhao, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reissuance of prior decision; stay of removal
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen alleging that his prior counsel was ineffective. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 f.2d 10 (1st. Cir. 1988). Specifically, the respondent alleges that one of the attorneys who has represented him in these proceedings contracted out certain duties to another attorney, who failed to carry out those duties. The respondent alleges that the attorney failed to properly inform him that his appeal to this Board had been dismissed. The respondent alleges that he has been prejudiced because he was unable to file an alternative application for relief while still in proceedings, and unable to file a timely motion to reconsider and a timely appeal. The respondent’s present motion is untimely, but he asserted that it should be accepted pursuant to the doctrine of equitable tolling. See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001).
 
The respondent has not established that the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel prevented him from filing a meritorious motion to remand while an appeal was pending wiih the Board, or in the alternative within the time limits for a motion to reopen after the Board’s decision in this case.¿FN1º The Board’s decision was issued in April 2004 and, according to the evidence submitted with the motion to reopen, the respondent’s marriage did not take place until March 2005, approximately 11 months later. Hence, the respondent could not have filed a legitimate motion to remand while the case was on appeal and any motion to reopen filed with the Board on or after the date of his marriage would have been untimely. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2.
 
In his motion, the respondent incorrectly states that the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision without opinion. The record reflects that the appeal was dismissed with a short opinion which, inter alia, briefly explained our reasons for finding the Immigration Judge’s adverse credibility determination to not be clearly erroneous. The respondent’s motion to reopen contains no arguments or evidence that would lead us to conclude differently, and we thus conclude that the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by former counsel’s failure to file a motion to reconsider.
 
Since the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance of prior counsel, he has not met the general standards for reopening applicable in the present context. See, e.g. Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 1984); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640. Since the respondent did not establish prejudice, we need not address the issue of equitable tolling. To the degree that the respondent’s argument is based on counsel’s failure to extend the possible duration of removal proceedings by filing an appeal with a federal circuit court of appeal, we note that we have no jurisdiction to consider issues involving the jurisdiction of federal courts.
 
*2 The respondent moves that the Board reissue its decision to allow him to seek review in the United States Court of Appeals. In the instant case the respondent does not allege any Board error or administrative problems; therefore, we have no procedural or substantive basis on which to reissue our decision. Further, as we stated above, we have no authority to consider issues involving the jurisdiction of federal courts.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is also denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tsz-Hai Huang, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Stephen A. Johnston
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on May 23, 2003. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not pertinent here), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before August 21, 2003. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until October 27, 2005, more than 2 years later. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time.
 
Current counsel for the respondent alleges that prior counsel, Steven Englander, provided ineffective assistance of counsel and that therefore equitable tolling should be applied to the regular filing deadlines in this case. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has filed an opposition to the motion, noting that it is untimely, asserting that due diligence has not been shown, and arguing that case law in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit would not lead to a conclusion that the respondent established ineffective assistance of counsel in this case. See, e.g., Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (equitable tolling will be applied where alien prevented from timely filing by deception, fraud, or error, so long as alien acted with due diligence). The respondent must also show prejudice in such cases. See Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1185-86 (9th Cir. 2004).
 
Prior counsel has rebutted the claims made by the respondent, and current counsel has stated that the respondent has not filed a formal bar complaint against Mr. Englander because “his making a bad judgment and legal analysis to waive these relief ¿sicº…did not rise to the level that a formal complaint would need to be filed” (Respondent’s Motion at 13). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (requirements for establishing claim of ineffective assistance of counsel). The respondent has been in the United States for 14 1/2 years and has failed to adjust her status during that period of time. The respondent now wishes to file an asylum application for the first time, without any showing that it should be excused from the 1-year filing deadline, and changed circumstances specific to the respondent’s case have not been shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), 1208.4(a). The record before us also does not establish that her current “marriage” to a United States citizen is bona fide or that a visa petition has been filed on her behalf by her third husband in the United States, and she has not met the requirements of Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002), for such a motion on the basis of a pending visa petition. The respondent has failed to establish that equitable tolling would be warranted in this case. We conclude that reopening would not be warranted in this case.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied. The request for a stay is also denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for stay of deportation is denied.

IN RE: OTTO FERNANDO RIVERA-BOTTZECK
File: AXX XX6 746 - Canon City
December 28, 2005
 
ORDER:
  
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Bonnie K. Brady
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
  
ORDER:
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.¿FN1º We affirm the Immigration Judge’s August 1, 2005 decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). Specifically, we find no legal error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent’s conviction for securities fraud constitutes an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(M)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i). Nor do we find clear error in the factual findings leading up to that determination. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (mandating that the Board “will accept the determination of factual issues by an immigration judge … unless the determination is clearly erroneous”).
 
As the Immigration Judge noted, to be considered for such discretionary relief, the respondent must prove that he has not been convicted of an aggravated felony. See section 240(A)(a)(3) of the Act. The respondent does not dispute that he pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and was granted a deferred judgment and sentence. The respondent, however, argues that the record does not support the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent was convicted of an offense in which “the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.” Section 101(a)(43)(M)(i). We disagree.
 
The record contains evidence indicating that the respondent was required, by the conditions of his deferred judgment, to pay $65,000 in restitution to certain named victims (Exhs. 3, 6, 8 at Attachments). Further, as the Immigration Judge noted, section 101(a)(43)(M)(i) does not require that the statute underlying the respondent’s conviction contain as an element loss to a victim in excess of $10,000. Rather, section 101(a)(43)(M)(i) requires only that the underlying offense involve fraud or deceit. Once the requisite fraud or deceit has been established, the conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony if the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000. See section 101(a)(43)(M)(i) of the Act. It is undisputed that the respondent was convicted of an offense involving fraud or deceit. However, on this record, the respondent has not demonstrated either that the victims of his crime suffered no monetary loss or that they suffered a loss less than $10,000. Consequently, the respondent has failed to prove that his securities fraud conviction is not an aggravated felony under the Act.
 
*2 Furthermore, contrary to the respondent’s assertions, the record contains no evidence indicating that the respondent’s conviction is not a final conviction for immigration purposes. Thus, it appears that respondent has a final aggravated felony conviction, which renders him ineligible for cancellation of removal. See section 240A(a)(3) of the Act. In addition, any alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony is ineligible for cancellation of removal regardless of whether the alien is actually charged with removability based on that conviction. Thus, as the Immigration Judge noted, it was not necessary to include such information in the Notice to Appear.
 
Finally, to the extent the respondent claims that he was denied due process during his hearing before the Immigration Judge, the respondent’s arguments are without merit. The record reveals that the respondent was represented by counsel and received a full and fair hearing on the merits of his claim.¿FN2º Although the respondent alleges error, he has not articulated or identified prejudice stemming from such errors. More importantly, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that the outcome of his case would have been different had the hearing been conducted in any other manner. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983).
 
On the whole, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s resolution. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: YAN, WEI JIAN
File: AXX-XX1-194 - New York
December 27, 2005
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Zhang, Henry, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 07, 2004. The respondent, a native and citizen of China, contests the Immigration Judge’s denial of his second motion to reopen his April 23, 2004, in absentia removal order. The respondent previously filed a motion to reopen his in absentia removal order on June 1, 2004, which the Immigration Judge denied on June 3, 2004. The respondent filed the second motion to reopen on July 2, 2004. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s second motion to reopen because it exceeded the numerical limitations for the filing of motions to reopen before the Immigration Judge. We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision. The regulations provide that an alien may only file 1 motion to reopen removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent has not met any of the exceptions to the numerical limitations for the filing of motions to reopen before the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4). Subsequent to the entry of the in absentia removal order, the respondent retained a new attorney to file his motions to reopen. The respondent alleged in his second motion to reopen that his prior attorney’s decision to attend his master calendar hearing more than 1 hour after it was scheduled constituted ineffective assistance which resulted in the entry of his in absentia removal order. The regulations provide that a motion to reopen may be filed within 180 days of an in absentia removal order if the alien demonstrates that he failed to appear due to exceptional circumstances. However, in the instant case, the respondent’s first motion to reopen did not meet the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to show ineffective assistance of counsel. He only attempted to meet the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, in his second motion to reopen. Furthermore, we note that the respondent does not allege that he received ineffective assistance from his current counsel who filed the first motion to reopen. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael S. Morano, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent has failed to establish that the address to which notice was sent, 100 SW 12th Avenue, Deerfield Beach, Florida 33442-3117, was not his correct address. We note that the Notice to Appear (NTA) was sent by regular mail to that address and was not returned as undeliverable. Moreover, the respondent has never claimed non-receipt of the NTA, which contained the requirement that the respondent notify the Immigration Court of any change of address.
 
Although the respondent claims ineffective assistance of counsel because his prior counsel failed to advise him of his hearing date, we note that the hearing notice was sent to the respondent, not to an attorney. Moreover, he has failed to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1997). Indeed, he has failed to establish that he had an attorney during the time period in question, for no attorney filed a Form EOIR-28 “Notice of Entry of Appearance as an Attorney” on his behalf until August 31, 2005, after the in absentia decision had been issued. We find that the Immigration Judge correctly found no basis to support a motion to reopen and dismiss the appeal.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eric O. Darko, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge dated July 26, 2004, finding the respondent removable as charged, denying her request for a continuance, but granting her application for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his decision”).
 
As a preliminary matter, the respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge did not have jurisdiction over her proceedings because the Notice to Appear (“NTA”) was improperly issued.¿FN1º In particular, the respondent contends that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (the “Service”) ceased to exist on March 1, 2003; however, the NTA which placed the respondent in removal proceedings indicates that it was issued by the Service on January 21, 2004. Consequently, the respondent alleges that because the Service did not exist at the time the NTA was issued, the NTA was not valid and the Immigration Judge did not have jurisdiction over the respondent in these proceedings. We are not persuaded by these arguments.
 
First, we note that the duties and responsibilities of the Service were transferred to the offices of the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002). See also 6 U.S.C. 271 et seq. The regulations indicate that references to the Service on or after March 1, 2003 mean the offices of the DHS to which the functions of the former Service were transferred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1001.1. Further, the record reflects that the NTA was issued by an authorized officer and properly filed with the Immigration Court. 8 C.F.R. § 1239.1(a). Finally, the NTA provided the respondent with proper notice of the allegations and charges against her, and she was given ample opportunity, through counsel, to reply and contest these allegations and charges. We find no reason to conclude that the respondent’s NTA was improperly issued or that the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction in these proceedings.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent further argues that the Immigration Judge erred by refusing to continue her proceedings so her United States citizen husband could file a new petition for alien relative (Form I-130) on her behalf. The record reflects that the DHS had already denied a visa petition which the respondent’s husband had previously filed because of inconsistencies in the personal interview between the respondent and her husband. The respondent did not appeal this denial. An Immigration Judge may grant a motion for continuance only “for good cause shown.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Silva-Rodriguez, 20 I&N Dec. 448 (BIA 1992). We do not find that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion in denying a continuance in this case where a visa petition, filed by the same petitioner on behalf of the same beneficiary for the same visa classification, had already been denied. Moreover, the denial of the respondent’s continuance in these removal proceedings does not preclude the respondent’s husband from filing a new visa petition directly with the DHS. Given these circumstances, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny a further continuance.
 
Finally, the respondent argues on appeal that due to the ineffective assistance provided by her former counsels, she and her husband were not properly prepared to provide evidence of their bona fide marriage at the interview before the DHS, and that this issue was not properly raised before the Immigration Judge. However, the respondent has not met the requirements for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Therefore, the respondent failed to make a proper claim against her former attorneys. Moreover, the respondent has not raised this issue in her visa petition proceedings. Consequently, we find no reason to remand the record to the Immigration Court.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to so depart, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sarkisian, Ruben N.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Charles W. Baccus,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). On March 11, 2004, the respondent appeared with his attorney Seth Reszko, who was acting as co-counsel with attorney Rita Mahdessian. He was granted voluntary departure until July 9, 2004, and waived appeal. The respondent, through attorney Rita Mahdessian, appealed the March 11, 2004, decision, and on August 20, 2004, this Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
 
The respondent filed a motion to reconsider on September 17, 2004, claiming that his waiver of appeal was not knowing and intelligent and claiming that his former attorney, Rita Mahdessian, ineffectively represented him. The motion to reconsider was denied by the Board on October 28, 2004, because the respondent complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) with regard to attorney Rita Mahdessian, but not with regard to Seth Reszko, who had actually appeared on his behalf on March 11, 2004.
 
On November 15, 2004, the respondent made a motion to reopen, asserting that the regulatory time bar for motions to reopen should be tolled because he did not know of Rita Mahdessian’s ineffective assistance of counsel until August 20, 2004, when the Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. He asserted that she ineffectively represented him by advising him not to voluntarily depart, and by filing a dilatory and frivolous appeal on his behalf even though she was aware that he had waived appeal. He noted that this dilatory appeal was not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction until after his voluntary departure had expired.
 
On May 11, 2004, an Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, noting in relevant part that the respondent had been previously advised that he needed to depart by July 9, 2004, and that he had waived appeal. On appeal, the respondent claimed that the Immigration Judge gave him too much credit for understanding immigration law. The fact that he waived his appeal based on his attorney’s assurance that everything would be taken care of, and that he relied on his attorney’s assurances in failing to depart, amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The record reflects that, at the time of the Immigration Judge’s March 11, 2004, decision, the only relief for which the respondent was eligible was voluntary departure (Tr. at 31). Although the respondent had potential eligibility for lawful permanent residence through his employer, he did not have that eligibility on March 11, 2004. Accordingly, there is no indication that attorney Seth Reszko, who represented him at that hearing, ineffectively represented him, or that he was prejudiced by any action of that individual. He applied for and received the only relief for which he was eligible. Moreover, the respondent received the extraordinary relief of 120 days of voluntary departure in exchange for the agreement not to appeal. As the respondent has not established that he would have been eligible for any form of relief had he been permitted to appeal, we find that the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent had not established prejudice through any actions taken on his behalf by attorney Seth Reszko.
 
*2 The respondent has also asserted that attorney Rita Mahdessian ineffectively represented him by advising him not to voluntarily depart, and by filing a dilatory and frivolous appeal on his behalf. He complied with Matter of Lozada, supra, with regard to attorney Mahdessian. He further noted that, although the November 15, 2004, motion was technically untimely, it was filed within 90 days after the respondent discovered the ineffective representation, which occurred on August 20, 2004, when the Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
 
Upon our review of the record, we find that, even if the respondent’s motion was timely, he is ineligible for any form of relief from removal because of his failure to depart pursuant to the March 11, 2004, voluntary departure order. Section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. 1229c(d), provides in relevant part that if an alien is permitted to voluntarily depart under that section and fails to do so within the time period specified, that person is subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and is ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1229c, and 1229b, 1255, 1258, and 1259. Accordingly, even if the Immigration Judge had found the motion to be timely and had reopened proceedings, the respondent would have been statutorily barred from relief. Although it appears that the respondent relied to his detriment on attorney Mahdessian’s advice to file an appeal and to not depart during the pendency of that appeal, and although it appears that he may have been severely prejudiced by his attorney’s advice, there is no remedy in the immigration laws for an individual in this respondent’s situation. The respondent would need to seek remedy against his attorney outside these proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL/MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hernandez, Arturo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Smith Turner, Leslie E.
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent appeals the order of removal, arguing that prior counsel allegedly failed to notify the respondent of the August 17, 2004, due date for the filing of an application for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. However, the record reflects the respondent was provided with the Motion to Withdraw Appearance filed by counsel, which included notification of the due date for the cancellation application. The respondent does not deny timely receipt of this motion, or of the Immigration Judge’s July 20, 2004, order granting the motion. Furthermore, the respondent has submitted no evidence that he has complied with the procedural requirements for claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), as there is no evidence that the attorney was notified of the allegations and provided an opportunity to respond, or that a complaint was filed with the state bar.
 
While the appeal has been pending, the respondent filed a motion to remand for an opportunity to apply for adjustment of status via a United States citizen spouse he married while in proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4). The record includes a receipt for the Form I-130 filed by his current wife, a completed Form I-485, a naturalization certificate for his wife dated November 22, 1985, a marriage certificate dated August 31, 2004, a Judgment of Absolute Divorce from the respondent’s prior spouse dated September 13, 2002, a divorce decree for the new spouse’s prior marriage dated February 5, 1999, income tax returns filed by his current wife prior to the marriage, and 3 affidavits from friends.
 
The evidence of the bona fides of the current marriage is conflicting, in that one of the affidavits from a friend indicates the couple purchased a home from the friend’s client in 1997, which would have been while the couple were previously legally married to other spouses. Furthermore no additional evidence of the bona fides of the marriage have been introduced, such as documentation showing joint ownership of a property, a lease showing joint tenancy of a common residence, or evidence of the commingling of financial resources. 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(B). The evidence regarding the bona fides of the marriage is not clear and convincing. See Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002), modifying Matter of Arthur, 20 I&N Dec. 475 (BIA 1992). Accordingly, the motion will be denied, and the appeal dismissed.
 
*2 FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. In the event of the failure to so depart, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order. See section 240B(b) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f).
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN RE: IFEANYI OKPECHUKWU
File: AXX XX3 971 - Detroit
December 12, 2005
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rickie Emmanuel Ibe, Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mark Jebson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s March 3, 2005, decision denying his motion to reconsider the denial of his motion to reopen in absentia proceedings. The appeal will be sustained, and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The record reflects that jurisdiction over the respondent’s claim was originally vested in the Houston Immigration Court. While there, the respondent apparently appeared at numerous hearings¿FN1º without fail, and properly informed the Immigration Court when he changed his address in February of 2002. In June of 2004 the respondent’s former representative filed a motion to transfer venue to Michigan, which was granted in a July 14, 2004, Immigration Judge’s decision (Exh. 4). A copy of the decision was sent to the respondent’s then-counsel of record in Houston, Texas, Mr. Anugwom. The notice clearly identified Mr. Anugwom as appearing “on behalf of respondent,” with the certificate of service on the notice reflecting that it was served not on the respondent, but on the “alien’s attorney/representative.” A hearing notice was thereafter sent to Mr. Anugwom at the same address to which all prior correspondence had been sent, informing him that the respondent was scheduled for a master hearing before the Detroit Immigration Court on August 11, 2004.
 
When he did not appear as scheduled, the respondent was ordered removed in absentia in an Immigration Judge’s August 11, 2004, decision. On December 30, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings, asserting that he never received notice of his hearing. In doing so he noted that his address in Michigan had been incorrectly listed in the order granting his change of venue, and stated that Mr. Anugwom had stopped representing the respondent after his move. The respondent stated that he believed he would be notified of all court hearings following the change of venue, but was not informed that a hearing had been scheduled by either the Immigration Court or his former attorney (Motion to Reopen at 3). As such, he maintains that he did not get proper notice of his hearing.
 
In denying the respondent’s motion to reopen the Immigration Judge noted that, as notice had been directed to the respondent’s former counsel, he did receive proper notice. Citing section 239(a)(2)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Immigration Judge also noted that the respondent did not comply with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637(BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
*2 The respondent thereafter filed a timely motion to reconsider in February of 2005, with which he submitted a letter from Mr. Anugwom. In the letter, the respondent’s former counsel asserted that after the motion to change venue was granted, his office had not received any further correspondence from any Immigration Court regarding the respondent’s hearing date. The Immigration Judge denied this motion in a March 3, 2005, decision finding that the respondent had presented no factual or legal error to support the claim. Citing Matter of Ramos, 23 I&N Dec. 336, 338 (BIA 2002).
 
A respondent alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra at 639; namely, the allegation must be supported by (1) an affidavit describing the agreement that was entered into with the attorney with respect to the actions to be taken and the representations made by the attorney; (2) proof that the petitioner has notified the attorney of the allegations and that the attorney has had an opportunity to respond; and (3) a statement about whether a complaint has been filed with an appropriate disciplinary authority if the representation involved a violation of legal obligations to the client. In addition, the petitioner must demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Id. at 640; see also Huicochea-Gomez v. INS, 237 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2001).
 
The Immigration Judge correctly found that the respondent had not satisfied the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, supra. However, we find that the record supports a finding that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel from Mr. Anugwom. We do not find Mr. Anugwom’s unsworn and self-serving statement that he did not receive the respondent’s hearing notice to be sufficient evidence of nondelivery. In the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, it is presumed that public officers, such as the United States Postal Service, properly discharge their duties. United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U.S. 1, 14-15 (1926); Butler v. Principi, 244 F.3d 1337, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2001); see also Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). The hearing notice was sent to the same address that all the other numerous items of correspondence from the Immigration Court had been sent, without any reported delivery problems. There is no evidence in the record that the hearing notice was returned by the Postal Service due to delivery or other difficulty. As such, we do not find that Mr. Anugwom’s unsworn and very generalized statement establishes that service of the heating notice was not properly effected upon him. Compare In respondent The Yoder Co, 758 F.2d 1114, 1118-9 (6th Cir. 1985). Moreover, as noted, the decision granting the change of venue made it clear that not only was he considered to be still representing the respondent, but that service of that notice was made only on him and not also to the respondent. Mr. Anugwom, as counsel to the respondent, should have known that until he filed a motion to withdraw as the respondent’s representative and/or another representative had filed a notice of entry, he would continue to represent the respondent. Whether Mr. Anugwom was not aware of this fact, or whether he chose to ignore the same, he provided the respondent with ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*3 We recognize that the respondent has some responsibility in the situation presented, but we find, on this particular set of facts, that the record clearly establishes that the respondent has acted responsibly in all matters before the Immigration Courts to date. His United States citizen wife has filed a visa petition on his behalf, further supporting the respondent’s implicit claim that he is motivated to diligently prosecute his case. Moreover, while his assumption that he would directly receive all notices from the Immigration Court after the change of venue was granted was incorrect, he clearly was not informed of his misapprehension by his former counsel, who should have done so. The respondent has unequivocally stated that his former counsel never contacted him after the motion to change venue was granted.
 
In light of our findings above, we find that reopening of the respondent’s claim was warranted, and the Immigration Judge erred in denying both the respondent’s motion to reopen and the motion to reconsider. On remand, the respondent should be allowed to pursue all forms of relief for which he may her eligible. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s August 11, 2004, January 11, 2005, and March 3, 2005, decisions are hereby vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

File: AXX XX7 878 - New York
December 8, 2005
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frank R. Liu, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa A. Radcliffe
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 21, 2003, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States, following the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing on May 2, 2003. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that he established exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear due to the ineffective assistance of former counsel. With his appeal brief the respondent submitted an affidavit, in which he claims that he arrived at his attorney’s office early, but she sent him to the Immigration Court late, and the court had already closed by the time he arrived. Subsequently he discovered that he had been ordered removed in absentia. The respondent has also submitted a letter to his former attorney, Florence Segler, Esquire, dated July 30, 2004, in which he informed her of the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel against her; and a response from Ms. Segler, dated August 9, 2004.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&NDec. 599 (BIA 1996).
 
In his decision, the Immigration Judge appears to imply that ineffective assistance of counsel is not an exceptional circumstance, which is incorrect based on relevant case law. On appeal the respondent is represented by new counsel and now alleges ineffective assistance of counsel as the basis for his failure to appear. He has submitted additional evidence on appeal, including his affidavit and a letter written by his former counsel, in which she admits that she should have sent the respondent to the Immiigration Court earlier than she did. The Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). However, we find such evidence probative of the respondent’s claim of exceptional circumstances due to ineffective assistance of counsel and will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for consideration.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ismael Gonzalez, Esquire
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 27, 2005, in which the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for a hearing on February 18, 2005. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.
 
On appeal and in his motion to reopen, the respondent, who may be eligible for relief under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, contends that he etablished exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), (e)(1). The respondent, through his attorney, argues that the respondent did not purposely fail to attend his hearing. Rather, the respondent did not attend the hearing based upon the specific instruction of his attorney, who was awaiting a decision on a motion to change venue.¿FN1º
 
While the Board has held that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve. the respondent of his responsibility to appear, in the instant case, the respondent’s failure to appear was clearly the result of the ineffective assistance of his counsel, who has admitted that he advised the respondent that he did not need to appear for the February 18, 2005, hearing.¿FN2º Thus, based on the facts presented in this case, we find that the respondent has established exceptional circumstances which would excuse his failure to appear on February 18, 2005. Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, the proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.
 
ORDER: Respondent’s appeal is sustained, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to change venue is granted, and venue is changed from Buffalo, New York, to Newark, New Jersey.

The record reflects that the motion for change of venue was denied by the Immigration Judge on February 10, 2005, but the respondent’s attorney, in an affirmation accompanying the motion to reopen, states that he never received the Iminigration Judge’s decision on that motion. Moreover, the respondent’s attorney states that he never received the February 18, 2005, removal order. The Immigration Judge, in his June 27, 2005, decision, does not question the credibility of the respondet’s attorney and does not state that he, in fact, denied the venue motion on February 10, 2005; rather, the Immigration Judge states that “¿tºhe change of venue was never subsequently granted by the Immigration Court.” Because of the ambiguity regarding the issuance of the February 10, 2005, decision, we have not applied Romero-Morales v. INS, 25 F.3d 125 (2nd Cir. 1994), to the facts of this case.

Despite the respondent’s failure to comply with the formal requirements of Matter Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d. 10 (1st Cir. 1988), we find that the respondent’s circumstances constitute a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as the ineffective assistance is clear and obvious from the record.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed an Immigration Judge denial of a motion to reopen. We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision for the reasons stated therein, with the following additions. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872 (BIA 1994). In an affidavit accompanying her motion, the respondent first asserted, without evidentiary support, that she had not been “in the right state of mind” and did not know what she was doing when she had previously withdrawn her claim for a fraud waiver and accepted voluntary departure. Yet, the respondent also indicated therein that she deliberately pursued this course because she allegedly feared incarceration and deportation if she lost her case. We concur with the Immigration Judge that the respondent had essentially failed to set forth a sufficient reason for reopening proceedings.
 
The respondent’s assertion on appeal that her former attorney provided her with ineffective assistance of counsel was not made before the Immigration Judge, nor does the respondent explain why she waited until her appeal to attempt to make this new claim. In addition to her failure to fully set forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, there is no evidence that the respondent acted with reasonable diligence to preserve any of her claims. See Rodriguez-Lariz, 282 F.3d 1218, 1225-26 (9th Cir. 2002); see also Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The record reflects that the respondent admitted she fraudulently secured her lawful permanent resident status, yet in her motion, there is no acknowledgment of her own responsibility for perpetrating this fraud. To the contrary, she attempts to absolve herself, merely stating that she signed paperwork “without being aware of the contents.” Her affidavit fails to acknowledge the fraudulent documentation which she presented to immigration authorities of her husband’s purported death, even though she knew he was actually alive. Given her failure to acknowledge her culpability, much less shown any remorse for her actions, we would deny the underlying waiver the respondent seeks in the exercise of discretion. Accordingly, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s discretionary denial of the motion to reopen. See Section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H).

IN RE: THEIEVENDRAN KIRITHARAN
File: AXX XX9 880 - Miami

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Visuvanathan Rudrakumaran, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 15, 2005, in which he denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on February 25, 2005. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded.
 
On appeal and in his motion to reopen, the respondent contends that he established exceptional circumstances due to ineffective assistance of counsel. His attorney of record, Mr. Rudrakumaran, states that he failed to advise the respondent that if the Immigration Judge did not make a determination on his motion for a change of venue, the respondent would have to attend the hearing. He also asserts that his failure to advise the respondent to attend the hearing and his failure to address the allegations in the motion should not result in penalizing the respondent. He notes that he submitted an attorney affirmation to that effect. Mr. Rudrakumaran also argues that the attorney affirmation attached to the motion to reopen satisfies the first two requirements pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Specifically, it encompasses the agreement entered into with counsel regarding the alien’s representation and provides an opportunity for counsel to address them. In reference to the requirement of filing a State Bar complaint, Mr. Rudrakumaran states that the primary goal of this requirement is to protect against collusion between an alien and his attorney to achieve delay. However, he contends that there is no suggestion of any collusion between the respondent and his attorney. Finally, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion for a change of venue on the same day of the hearing constitutes exceptional circumstances.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996). In the case at bar, the respondent’s attorney has admitted that the respondent failed to appear at the hearing due solely to his failure to advise the respondent that he must attend the hearing if the Immigration Judge did not make a decision on the motion for a change of venue prior to the scheduled hearing. The respondent’s attorney submitted an attorney affirmation in which he discusses his representation of the respondent and his failure to properly advise the respondent regarding the pending motion for a change of venue. We find that the respondent has presented a valid claim of ineffective assistance. of counsel. We note that the requirement that a bar complaint be filed is to ensure that collusion does not occur, and that the claim of ineffective, assistance of counsel is a valid one. See Matter of Lozada, supra. Therefore, as we find that counsel did afford the respondent ineffective assistance and in light of the lack of any bar complaint, we shall forward this matter to the Executive Office for Immigration Review Bar counsel for review and the institution of any disciplinary measures deemed appropriate. The appeal will be sustained. The proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Heidi J. Meyers, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)º - Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER
 
PER CURIAM. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s April 13, 2005, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen deportation proceedings that became final in February 1987.
 
Specifically, we find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent, in December 1986, did knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily accept an order of voluntary departure from the Immigration Court with an alternative order of deportation in the event of her failure to timely depart. (R. Motion to Reopen, Exh. D). Furthermore, we find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent failed to depart in compliance with her voluntary departure order, and that this failure made her subject to an administratively final order of deportation in February 1987. Because the respondent was present in the United States under an outstanding order of deportation as of February 1987, any motion to reopen she wished to file in Immigration Court was due by not later than September 30, 1996. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). The respondent’s motion was not filed until March 2005, and therefore the Immigration Judge properly denied it as untimely.
 
The respondent suggests that the regulatory filing deadline for motions to reopen does not apply to her or, in the alternative, that any such deadline should be equitably tolled on the facts of her case. We disagree. The deadlines for filing motions to reopen were established by a final agency regulation which became effective on July 1, 1996, and aliens who were present in the United States under an outstanding order of deportation at the time the regulation went into effect were given 90 days to file such motions, measured from the July 1, 1996, effective date of the final rule. See 61 Fed. Reg. 18900-01, 18908 (April 29, 1996). Publication of these filing deadlines in the Federal Register was sufficient to give the respondent notice of them. 44 U.S.C. § 1507; Fed. Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, 332 U.S. 380, 384-85 (1947).
 
As to the respondent’s invocation of the equitable tolling doctrine, we would simply note that neither this Board nor the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this proceeding arises, has he!d that equitable tolling applies to the filing deadlines set forth in the Immigration Court’s motions regulations. See also Abdi v. Attorney General, 2005 WL 3046741 (11th Cir. 2005). Furthermore, while an Immigration Judge does have limited discretionary power to reopen proceedings sua sponte, even after expiration of the relevant filing deadlines, such action is only warranted upon a showing of truly exceptional circumstances. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). No such exceptional circumstances have been shown in this instance.
 
*2 First, the respondent’s present assertion that she did not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily accept a voluntary departure order is simply irreconcilable with assertions that both she and her former attorney of record made in various sworn documents that were submitted to the Immigration Court in December 1986. (Motion to Reopen, Exh. D, unnumbered pages 2-4). Absent a showing of egregious circumstances rising to the level of ineffective assistance, decisions of counsel are binding on the respondent in immigration proceedings. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). Although not framed as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent essentially contends that her former attorney (and, presumably, the notary who witnessed her affidavits and attested to the fact that they had been read to her in her native language) defrauded both herself and the court, for reasons unknown. At a minimum, the respondent’s former attorney should be given an opportunity to respond to such a serious allegation, but the respondent concedes that she has not complied with any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), including the requirement that the attorney whose professional conduct is being questioned be notified of the charges and given a chance to explain his or her conduct.
 
Contrary to the respondent’s assertion on appeal, moreover, there is nothing inherently unfair about the streamlined procedures followed in her deportation proceedings. It is well-established that a full-blown deportation hearing need not be held where the respondent has admitted the factual allegations and charges in the Order to Show Cause and where there is no legal issue remaining to be decided. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.48(b). In this instance, the respondent’s affidavits contain unequivocal admissions of deportability, as well as affirmative acknowledgment that future Immigration Court proceedings would be conducted in her absence. Under such circumstances it is generally presumed that the Immigration Judge will dispose of the matter by summary order, as was done here. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.50(b).
 
Finally, the respondent has not demonstrated that she has exercised due diligence in filing her motion. Even viewing the facts of this case in the light most favorable to the respondent, she became aware of the existence of her outstanding deportation order in September 2003. Yet she did not file her motion to reopen with the Immigration Court until March 18, 2005, more than 500 days later. Although there is some indication that the respondent may have filed a prior motion in the wrong venue, even this motion was not filed until June 2004, many months after she discovered her predicament. Under the circumstances, we see no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s decision not to suspend the September 30, 1996, filing deadline in the respondent’s case.
 
*3 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

David H. Burke
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The Immigration Judge properly noted that there is no evidence that the respondent’s criminal attorney, who allegedly told him not to appear at his immigration hearing, had ever represented him in his immigration proceedings. The Immigration Judge correctly found that the respondent has not presented a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that is compliant with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent’s claim on appeal that he is eligible for relief from removal is unpersuasive and not supported by evidence that he is prima facie eligible for relief. The respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances to excuse his failure to attend his hearing. The Immigration Judge appropriately denied his motion to reopen. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dax Brian Deason, Esquire
*1 This matter was last before the Board on May 31, 2005, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s January 18, 2005, denial of her second motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of deportation entered on May 25, 1989. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on August 26, 2005. The motion will be denied.
 
As a preliminary matter, the respondent’s motion contains some aspects that appear to be in the nature of a motion to reconsider; for example, claims that the record does not support the factual determination that proper notice was sent to attorney Mendoza (her attorney at the time of the deportation hearing) and arguments that the correct legal standard to apply is whether prior counsel received “actual notice” of her deportation hearing. Because her motion was not filed within 30 days of our decision, and is therefore untimely as a motion to reconsider, we will not address any arguments that appear to be challenges to the legal and factual determinations made in that decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b).
 
As for the motion to reopen, any evidence she seeks to present now with regard to her ineffective assistance of counsel claim against attorney Mendoza could previously have been obtained and presented, and therefore cannot be considered new and previously unavailable under the applicable regulatory standards. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Nevertheless, she urges that she should be allowed to submit evidence of compliance with Lozada at this time because the subsequent attorneys who represented her for the prior two motions and at the Board all provided her with ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that to prevail on a due process challenge, an alien must make a showing of “substantial prejudice.” De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir. 2004). Even if we were to assume, for sake of argument, that the evidence submitted with this new motion to reopen meets the procedural requirements set forth in Lozada, we nevertheless find that the respondent has failed to establish ineffective, assistance of counsel by Mr. Mendoza such that reopening of the in absentia proceeding would have been warranted. The respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim against attorney Mendoza is based on her assertion that he never informed her that her deportation hearing was scheduled for May 25, 1989. Yet, the respondent’s own affidavit establishes that, upon release from Harlingen, she went to California to live with her father, instead of going to live with her uncle at the address in Spring, Texas, that she had provided to counsel and the Immigration Court. Motion to Reopen, tab D (copy of affidavit initially submitted with Second Motion to Reopen). An affidavit from her uncle that she previously submitted further establishes that her uncle only lived at that address until “about April 1989.” Second Motion to Reopen, tab B. Neither affidavit indicates that the respondent or her uncle made any attempt to keep in contact with attorney Mendoza or let him know where the respondent was actually residing. As the Immigration Judge correctly found, proper notice of the scheduled hearing was sent to attorney Mendoza at his correct address on April 18, 1989 (Exh. 4). The Immigration Judge reasonably declined to give much weight to the assertions claiming counsel did not inform her of the scheduled hearing, especially where the affidavits do not reflect any attempt to keep counsel informed of the respondent’s whereabouts or a means to contact her, or that she or her family attempted to contact attorney Mendoza to ascertain the status of her deportation proceedings at any time during the 15 years that elapsed before she filed her motion to reopen. Nothing in this motion to reopen provides new evidence pertaining to these issues. Thus, given that the respondent has not established ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney Mendoza, her claims of ineffective assistance of counsel against subsequent attorneys fail because she has not shown that she was prejudiced by their actions. De Zavala v. Ashcroft, supra. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.

November 23, 2005
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anthony M. Cacavio
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; cancellation of removal
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This matter was last before the Board on July 25, 2005, when we dismissed as untimely the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s November 29, 2004, decision denying his requests for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status and granting him the privilege of voluntary departure. The respondent has timely filed a motion to reconsider our prior decision. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the motion.
 
The respondent does not deny that his appeal was untimely filed but rather attributes the late filing to ineffective assistance provided by a “non-attorney.”¿FN1º In making this claim, however, the respondent has failed to comply with any of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See generally Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002) (applying Lozada requirements to ineffective assistance claims against non-attorneys).
 
Although the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that satisfaction of the formal requirements of Lozada need not be demonstrated where ineffective assistance of counsel is clear from the administrative record, no such showing has been made here. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
In this case, there is no indication that the respondent was prejudiced by the late filing of his appeal. The respondent is seeking relief from removal in the form of cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), and also adjustment of status. However, he is not eligible for either form of relief.
 
Although he claims that he has now lived in the United States for over 10 years, he is ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act for lack of a showing that he has 10 years of continuous physical presence prior to service of the Notice to Appear on November 10, 2004. See Tr. at 29 (indicating that the respondent has lived in the United States since 1995). Further, although he is the beneficiary of a second-preference visa petition, a visa is currently unavailable to him (Tr. at 28). See Department of State, Visa Bulletin, No.88, Vol. VIII (December 2005) (listing February 1, 1992, as the current priority date for Mexico in the case of an unmarried son of lawful permanent resident visa category); see also Respondent’s Motion, attachment (Notice of Action listing July 5, 1996, as the priority date for the underlying approved visa petition). Therefore, he cannot demonstrate eligibility for adjustment of status, even assuming that he otherwise qualified for such relief.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present in the United States without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals the immigration Judge’s decision, dated June 27, 2005, denying the respondents motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent argues on appeal that he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Act claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representation counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and, (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec, 553, 556 (BIA 2003); cf. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Furthermore, the respondent must show that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance. See Matter of Assaad, supra.
 
In this case, the respondent has completely failed to comply with any of the requirements for establishing that the received ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent did not provide an affidavit detailing the agreement between prior counsel and himself. He did not provide evidence that he notified prior counsel of his allegations or that he filed a complaint with the proper disciplinary authorities. Moreover, while the respondent claims that he is eligible to adjust his status, he failed to provide the application and all supporting documents. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (A motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.). Consequently, the respondent has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s performance. See Matter of Assaad, supra. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is without merit.

File: A34 113 347 - Somers, Connecticut
August 25, 2005
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening, termination
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on July 29, 1993, when we sustained the appeal filed by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) and reversed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 23, 1992, granting the respondent’s request for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). On May 26, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of his former counsel, and requesting termination of the proceedings on the basis that he is a derivative citizen of the United States. The motion will be denied.
 
At the outset, the claim to United States citizenship, as has been proffered by the respondent, raises issues directly related to this Board’s jurisdiction over the instant case. Thus, a claim to citizenship is never waived and may be tendered at any point during proceedings. The burden of proof in establishing alienage in deportation proceedings is on the Service. United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U.S. 149 (1923); United States v. Neelly, 207 F.2d 281 (7th Cir. 1953). However, one born abroad is prima facie an alien. Matter of A-M-, 7 I&N Dec. 332 (BIA 1956). Furthermore, where it is undisputed that an alien sought to be deported was born in a foreign country and came to the United States from that country, the burden of proof to establish United States citizenship is upon the alien. United States v. Neelly, supra. Such an alien is required to affirmatively establish his citizenship claim. Matter of A-M-, supra. A base claim of citizenship, unsubstantiated by any evidence is insufficient to meet the alien’s burden. United States v. Neelly, supra.
 
However, on the record before us, we are unable to find support for the respondent’s citizenship claim. See Matter of Tijerina-Villareal, 13 I&N Dec. 327, 330 (BIA 1969) (finding that a respondent who could not prove his father resided in the United States for the requisite number of years required by the Act to retain citizenship did not meet his burden of proof that he was a citizen). The citizenship of children born abroad to an alien parent who subsequently becomes a United States citizen is governed by section 321 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1432, the law which was in effect at the time the respondent became 18-years-old, and which describes the conditions under which such citizenship is automatically acquired, and not section 322 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1433, as he contends in his motion.1 Prior to its recent repeal, Section 321 of the Immigration and Nationality Act provided as follows:
*2 (a) A child born outside of the United States of alien parents … becomes a citizen of the United States upon the fulfillment of the following conditions:
(1) The naturalization of both parents: or
 
(2) The naturalization of the surviving parent if one of the surviving parents is deceased; or
 
(3) The naturalization of the parent having legal custody of the child when there has been a legal separation of the parents or the naturalization of the mother if the child is born out of wedlock and the paternity of the child is not established by legitimation; and if
 
(4) Such naturalization takes place while such child is under the age of eighteen years; and
 
(5) Such child is residing in the United States pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of the naturalization of … the parent naturalized under clause (2) or (3) of this subsection, or thereafter begins to reside permanently in the United States while under the age of 18 years.
 
 
 
Examining the case before us, the respondent admitted that he was born in Jamaica, and has been residing in the United States pursuant to his admission as a lawful permanent resident on April 4, 1975 (Tr. at 20). Significantly, based on the evidence accompanying the motion, at the time the respondent attained the age of eighteen, only the respondent’s father had become a naturalized United States citizen. The respondent has presented no evidence that his mother had also naturalized prior to his eighteenth birthday.2 In order to benefit from the derivative citizenship provision of section 321 of the Act, the respondent would have to demonstrate that both his mother and father were naturalized prior to his having attained the age of eighteen, and there is no evidence that she ever naturalized. Cf. section 321(a)(1) of the Act. A person who claims derivative United States citizenship has the burden to establish it. See Matter of Leyva, 16 I&N Dec. 118 (BIA 1977); Matter of Tijerina-Villareal, supra. The respondent has not sustained his burden, in this regard.
 
Furthermore, even if we were to find the respondent has generally complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 627 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), regarding his ineffective assistance of counsel claims, and accepting his allegations as true, it does not alter any aspect of the Board’s decision. At the outset, we consider the motion to reopen is untimely. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on July 29, 1993. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before September 30, 1996. The record, however, reflects that the respondent’s motion was not filed until May 26, 2005. Consequently, the respondent’s motion appears to be untimely filed, and not properly before us. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
*3 Moreover, even if the respondent’s motion had been timely filed and he had established compliance with the Lozada criteria, reopening would still not be warranted. The respondent argues that his former counsel was obligated to file a petition for review with the Second Circuit and provided ineffective assistance when he failed to do so. We note, however, the petition for review that his former attorney failed to file was with the Second Circuit and not with the Board. Consequently, this alleged ineffectiveness, if true, occurred after the Board rendered its July 29, 1993, decision. We find no evidence of irregularity or Board error regarding the service of our July 29, 1993, decision. Thus, any error before the Second Circuit by former counsel does not implicate an action by the Board since the Board made no error as a result of former counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness on this ground. Moreover, the respondent can show no prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The Board can provide no remedy for any alleged ineffectiveness that arose after the Board rendered its decision. The proper forum over his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel lies with the Second Circuit and not with the Board. In addition, we find no support for the respondent’s contention that his former attorney provided ineffective assistance when he failed to explore his claim as to derivative citizenship, as the discussion above reflects the respondent was not entitled to said relief. See section 321(a)(1) of the Act.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

The automatic citizenship provisions now found in section 322 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1433, as amended by the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-395, 114 Stat. 1631 (“Child Citizenship Act”), are not applicable to his situation. We have addressed this specific issue and found that the Child Citizenship Act is not retroactively applicable. Matter of Rodriguez-Tejedor, 23 I&N Dec. 153 (BIA 2001). Therefore, as the respondent was over the age of 18 years as of the effective date of the Child Citizenship Act, he is ineligible for automatic citizenship under that provision.

The record reflects that at the time of his hearing before the Immigration Judge on September 23, 1992, the respondent testified that his mother was then a lawful permanent resident of the United States (Tr. at 21).

This was the respondent’s second motion to reopen, and it failed to address at all the fact that he was ordered deported in absentia on December 2, 1999. Nor does it reference the fact that a motion to reopen and rescind that order, that was filed by his prior attorney, was denied by the Immigration Judge on June 29, 2001, because he failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances. However, the Immigration Judge denied the second motion on November 5, 2004, for failure to meet the standards for rescinding an in absentia order.1
 
On appeal, the same attorney who filed the second motion raises, for the first time, an allegation of ineffective assistance against the attorney who prepared the first. He also seeks to present new evidence that the respondent’s failure to appear in 1999 was due to exceptional circumstances. Although an alien in deportation proceedings may file more than one motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia deportation order, such motions must still be made within the statutory 180-day period unless a proper equitable tolling claim is made. Ineffective assistance of counsel can provide a basis for tolling the statutory period. However, in this case, the respondent has not complied with any of the procedural steps set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making such a claim, nor has he demonstrated that he exercised due diligence in seeking to reopen on that basis. Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 130 (2d Cir. 2000) (finding deadline for motions to reopen deportation proceedings may be equitably tolled, but alien failed to exercise due diligence required for equitable tolling). The motion that was filed by the attorney whose competence is now being challenged was denied by an Immigration Judge more than four years ago and the respondent offers no explanation for the delay. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the Section 242B rescission standards have not been met.
 
An alien is not required to rescind his or her deportation order under section 242B of the Act if he or she is pursuing an application for new relief and there is no evidence that the respondent received the required warnings under section 242B(e) of the Act. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). However, the motion to reopen is then subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.2(e) and 3.23(b)(3). Under these standards, the respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 90 days after the final order of deportation. He is accordingly precluded from having his motion considered under the general time limitations for a motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion is the correct result. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony

APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on May 10, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act abandoned. On June 10, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider, arguing ineffective assistance of his prior counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not filed a brief in response to the respondent’s motion. The respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider “is a request that the Board reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked, while ¿aº motion to reopen is usually based upon new evidence or a change in factual circumstances.” See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 n.1 (BIA 1991). Although characterized as a motion to reconsider, the applicant’s motion does not specify errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision, based on the evidence that was previously presented to the Board, but rather seeks to present evidence not previously submitted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). As the applicant’s motion does not specify errors of law or fact in the prior Board decision based on evidence previously presented, the motion to reconsider is denied.
 
Inasmuch as the respondent seeks to present evidence that was not previously submitted, the motion is properly characterized as a motion to reopen. In his motion, the respondent argues that his prior counsel provided ineffective assistance, based upon his prior counsel’s failure to submit his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c)of the Act prior to the expiration of the deadline established by the Immigration Judge. However, the respondent has failed to comply with the procedural requirements as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). While the respondent has submitted an affidavit outlining the alleged ineffectiveness of his prior counsel, the respondent has failed to submit evidence indicating that he filed a complaint with the Disciplinary Committee of the New York Supreme Court or evidence that he informed his prior counsel of the alleged ineffective assistance and gave the attorney an opportunity to respond to the allegations. We find, therefore, that the respondent has failed to satisfy the procedural requirements for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose Alexis Rojas, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 8, 2004, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear at the hearing on July 8, 2003. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that he established exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear due to the ineffective assistance of former counsel. He claims that he never received notice of the hearing, and he was not aware of the hearing date. The respondent indicates that he has informed his former attorney of his ineffective representation and has provided him with an opportunity to respond, but his former counsel has not contacted the respondent. With his appeal brief, the respondent has submitted an affidavit and a copy of a letter to his former attorney dated April 21, 2005, in support of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995).
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge had previously granted the respondent’s motion to reopen subsequent to an in absentia order dated March 13, 2001. Furthermore, a hearing notice dated April 29, 2003, reflects that the respondent received oral and written notice in court of the hearing scheduled for July 8, 2003. Consequently, the respondent’s claim on appeal that he never received notice of the hearing is contradicted by the evidence of record. Furthermore, although the respondent asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal, he has not complied with all of the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Heidi J. Meyers, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa M. Golub
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent deported in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on February 29, 1996. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that he established ineffective assistance of counsel, and that equitable tolling should be applied to find his motion timely filed. The respondent also asserts that he is eligible for adjustment of status based on his marriage to a United States citizen. The respondent has submitted new evidence on appeal. The Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995).
 
We find that the respondent has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Furthermore, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has determined that the 180-day time limitation may be equitably tolled. See Borges v. Gonzales, 402 F.3d 398 (3rd Cir. 2005)(180-day time limitation for motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances could be equitably tolled, and could be tolled for fraud). However, even if equitable tolling is applied for untimely motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in pursing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and seeking reopening based on adjustment of status. As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent became aware of his former counsel’s misrepresentations in June 2004 when he took possession of his file from her and discovered that she had never filed a motion to reopen on his behalf. See Respondent’s Affidavit, dated January 31, 2005. The respondent failed to file his motion to reopen until March 17, 2005, which is more than 180 days after he discovered the misrepresentations made by his former counsel. Therefore, the respondent failed to file his motion to reopen timely.
 
Finally, the respondent also seeks reopening to apply for adjustment of status. An alien is not required to rescind his or her deportation order under section 242B of the Act if he or she is pursuing an application for new relief, and provided there is no evidence that the respondent received the required warnings under section 242B(e) of the Act. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). Rather, the motion to reopen is only subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3).¿FN1º Under these standards, the respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s decision. He is accordingly precluded.from having his motion considered under the general time limitations for a motion to reopen.¿FN2º Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

Pursuant to 8 C.F.R.§§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3), a motion to reopen for the purpose of acting on an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.

We therefore decline to address the issue of prima facie eligibility for relief from deportation, or whether the respondent would deserve a favorable exercise of discretion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Justin Conlon, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Steven Connelly
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of Nepal, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his motion to reopen. We have jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. The appeal is dismissed.
 
The record reflects that an Immigration Judge on March 26, 2001, ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States because he failed to appear for his hearing. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on January 26, 2005, but that request was denied on February 25, 2005. This timely appeal followed.
 
Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C) provides, in pertinent part, that an in absentia order may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) states, “The term ‘exceptional circumstances’ refers to exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.”
 
In the instant case, the respondent indicated through counsel, that his former attorney instructed him not to appear for his hearing. He argued on appeal that he was victimized by his attorney’s negligence, and he should not be denied an opportunity to seek adjustment of status even though his motion to reopen was filed untimely.
 
In Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000), the court recognized the doctrine of “equitable tolling” of the statute of limitations regarding the filing of a motion to reopen. The court held that an alien must demonstrate not only that the alien’s constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll. Id. In that case, the court concluded that the alien failed to demonstrate such diligence, and concluded that equitable tolling did not apply. Id.
 
Accordingly, under Iavorski v. INS, supra, the Board must first address whether the respondent was denied due process in these proceedings based upon the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved applicant setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the applicant in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640.
 
*2 In denying the respondent’s motion, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent neglected to provide a response of former counsel to the complaint, or an explanation for why a response could not be supplied. The Board need not resolve whether the respondent satisfied the procedural requirements for a claim based upon ineffective assistance of counsel because we find that the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. The respondent indicated on page 3 of his affidavit that he received a letter from the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) a few weeks after his hearing that informed him that he had been ordered deported in absentia. According to the respondent, he contacted his former lawyer, but was instructed that the matter would be resolved. It was not until four years later did the respondent inquiry about his immigration status with a different attorney. Under these circumstances, we find that we cannot toll the statute of limitations for seeking reopening to a date after the respondent learned that he was subject to an order of removal. On such date, the respondent should have been aware that he may have received improper legal advice from his former attorney. It was therefore incumbent on him to seek reopening based upon ineffective assistance of counsel within the next 180 days. Having not done so, renders his request for reopening untimely. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. We therefore are unable to find that reopening is appropriate.
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carlos A. Cruz, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In our last decision, dated August 28, 2003, the Board denied the respondent’s prior motion to reopen because it was untimely and barred by the number restrictions of 8 C.F.R. 3.2(c). The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on March 12, 1998, and filed a timely motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, which he denied on June 6, 1998. The Board dismissed, as moot, an appeal from the denial of the first motion on December 12, 1998. On September 24, 2004, the respondent filed with the Board a motion to reconsider, which was substantively a second motion to reopen, raising a new claim of ineffective assistance against Mr. Bueno, the attorney who had prepared her first motion. However, as noted in a footnote in our last decision denying the motion, the respondent did not meet the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). We further found that the respondent’s second motion to reopen failed to establish exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of our limited discretion to reopen proceedings sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
The respondent filed the instant motion, which is substantively her third motion to reopen, on May 9, 2005. It essentially restates the basis for the second motion, but is supported by evidence that may be viewed as substantially complying with the Lozada requirements. However, neither the respondent’s second motion nor her third motion states when she ultimately contacted her present counsel and concluded, based on her present counsel’s advice, that Mr. Bueno may have been ineffective in presenting her claim that exceptional circumstances prevented her appearance at the March 12, 1998, hearing. The motions simply state that “¿aºfter many years of questions and doubts about ¿ herº deportation order, the respondent visited the Law Offices of Carlos A. Cruz for assistance.” See Respondent’s September 24, 2002, motion at 2 and the May 9, 2005, motion at 3.
 
In any event, it is clear that she learned of the potential ineffective assistance claim against Mr. Bueno by the time Mr. Cruz filed the September 24, 2002, motion, since the allegation of ineffective assistance was made at that point. She did not file a motion to reconsider our August 28, 2003, denial of her second motion, and she did not file the third motion that is now before us until 19 months later. Under these circumstances, even if there had been a basis for tolling the 180-day time limit, the clock started again at least by September 2002, and had long run out when the third motion was filed. See Fajardo v. INS, 300 F3d 1019 (9th Cir. 2002) (the 180 time limit may be tolled until the point where the alien becomes aware of the harm caused by the ineffective assistance of counsel.). Once she became aware that she had been harmed by ineffective assistance, the statutory period did not continue be tolled while she made a second attempt with her present counsel to substantially comply with the Lozada requirements. The rescission requirements have not been met.
 
*2 The formal rescission requirements need not be met in certain circumstances where the alien is seeking to apply for relief that was previously unavailable. In such cases, however, the motion to reopen is subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3). Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). The motion fails to meet the general requirements governing reopening. The motion is not timely because it was filed more than seven years after the final order in this case rather than within the 90-day time limit for general motions. Further, it is not supported by a completed adjustment application or evidence of the bona fides of the marriage. Finally, the fact that, after a final order of removal, the 35-year-old respondent married a United States citizen in his seventies and an invalid, and may potentially be eligible for relief based on that marriage if a visa petition is ultimately approved, does not warrant sua sponte reopening. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (our discretion to reopen proceedings sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to circumvent the regulations even when enforcing them may result in hardship).
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Yoram Nachimovsky, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Georgina M. Picos
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent in the instant case has filed a document titled “Urgent Request For Relief and Immediate Release and/or Bond Determination.” Due to its content, it will be construed by the Board as a motion to reopen. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on March 19, 2004. With certain exceptions, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the administratively final order. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before June 17, 2004. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until July 6, 2005. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time.
 
Although the respondent now raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not complied with the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We further note that inasmuch as the respondent has waited more than one year before filing the instant motion, the respondent has not exercised due diligence in pursuing the benefit of equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent also asks for a change in custody status. At this time, neither an Immigration Judge nor this Board has authority to set bond conditions because a final order of removal has been entered in the respondent’s case.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL AND CERTIFICATION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Julia A. Thorne, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Victoria Christian,
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before the Board on November 8, 2004, when the record was returned to the Immigration Judge for a new decision meeting the requirements of Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999). The record has now been returned to the Board with the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 16, 2004, and the parties have been provided an opportunity to file briefs.
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s denial of a second motion seeking to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal that was entered on November 16, 2001. The respondent argues that the second motion fully complies with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and that the time and number restrictions on motions to reopen should be equitably tolled because he received ineffective assistance from his former counsel. The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he did not meet the requirement that the accused counsel be notified of the charges against him. He points out that a certified mail receipt was provided with the second motion to establish that Mr. Owens was sent a copy of his affidavit, the complaint to the disciplinary committee, and the supporting documentation. We are persuaded that the respondent did provide notice of his complaint to Mr. Owens. That claim is buttressed by his submission with his appeal brief of an April 29, 2004, letter from the Kentucky Bar Association which states that a copy of the response to his complaint is enclosed.
 
The Sixth Circuit has not yet ruled on the issue whether ineffective assistance of counsel warrants the equitable tolling of the time and number restrictions on motions. See Scorteanu v. INS, 339 F.3d 407 (6th Cir. 2003). We are not inclined to reach the issue in this case because we will take a negative inference from the respondent’s failure to provide with his appeal brief the response that he received to his complaint against Mr. Owens. See Matter of Lozada, supra at 639 (any response from the accused counsel should be provided). He provided only the cover letter, most likely because that is favorable to his claim to have complied with the notice requirement of Lozada. The absence of the enclosed response is particularly troubling in this case because the counsel who represented the respondent before Mr. Owens withdrew as his representative citing in part the respondent’s deliberate disregard of their agreement, including paying counsel and reasonably communicating with counsel regarding his whereabouts. In light of the respondent’s history of failing to cooperate with counsel and his present failure to disclose an existing response to his complaint against Mr. Owens, we will not find that the respondent has demonstrated that he has been ineffectively assisted by him. The procedural requirements set forth in Lozada are designed to avoid the potential for abuse by making baseless allegations. The protective mechanism created by Lozada would be undermined if Lozada is read as allowing an alien to time such a motion so that the impugned counsel does not have adequate time to respond before the motion is filed, and then excuse the alien’s failure to provide to the Board a subsequently received response to the allegations. Therefore, even if equitable tolling claims based on ineffective assistance of counsel were to be recognized in this circuit, we find that he has failed to establish such a claim. The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: GONZALO RAMIREZ-LLAMAS
File: AXX XX2 138 - Los Angeles
August 4, 2005
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Beth S. Persky, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on March 3, 2003, when we denied the respondent’s second motion to reopen. The respondent, through counsel, now has filed another motion to reopen, which will be denied.
 
A party seeking to reopen removal proceedings must state the new facts he intends to establish, supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c), 1003.23(b)(3) (2005); INS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450 U.S. 139 (1981); Matter of Leon-Orosco and Rodriguez-Colas, 19 I&N Dec. 136 (BIA 1984; A.G. 1984); Matter of Reyes, 18 I&N Dec. 249 (BIA 1982). A motion to reopen will not be granted unless it establishes a prima facie case of statutory and discretionary eligibility for the underlying substantive relief sought. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
By way of background, the respondent is a 31-year-old Mexican national male who is married to a naturalized United States citizen. In our previous decision, we denied the motion to reopen despite the respondent’s claim that he was eligible for adjustment of status. We observed that the respondent had not voluntarily departed from the United States as required under the terms of his voluntary departure order, and he therefore was not eligible for certain forms of relief, including adjustment of status, absent exceptional circumstances pursuant to Mattter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996).
 
In the instant motion, the respondent is represented by the same attorney that represented him in connection with the previous motion to reopen filed in 2002. Counsel now claims that the respondent’s case should be reopened based on the alleged mistakes and misconduct of the attorney that he hired in 1998 to represent him at his immigration hearing. Counsel alleges that the respondent has satisfied the criteria to establish ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) by filing a complaint with the state bar association for the previous attorney.
 
Upon review, the motion will be denied. The respondent has failed to meet the standards for reopening. In this regard, we note that the respondent has waited until 2005 to allege ineffective assistance of counsel against an attorney who had represented him in 1998 and 1999, and he has waited more than 2 years after our previous decision to raise this issue. In addition, the respondent’s present counsel represented him in connection with his previous motion to reopen and presumably was familiar with the facts of his case. Therefore, present counsel could have raised an ineffective assistance argument in the motion to reopen filed in 2002. Finally, the respondent has not established his prima facie eligibility for the requested relief of adjustment of status in order to merit reopening. As we indicated in our previous decision, he is not eligible for adjustment of status because he failed to comply with his voluntary departure order. Matter of Shaar, supra. The motion will be denied.
 
*2 Therefore, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent is ordered removed from the United States.

IN RE: ALI HUSSEIN HASSAN
File: AXX XX7 734 - Detroit
August 1, 2005
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Wilton A. Hom, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael B. Dobson,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge‘s decision dated July 13, 2004. On appeal, the respondent alleges he has received ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
In his brief, the respondent alleges that the respondent has advised his former attorney of his complaint and has filed a complaint with the “appropriate disciplinary authorities.” However, the respondent has failed to submit evidence of this.
 
The respondent has failed to fulfil the prerequisites for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent has failed to attach to the appeal a sworn affidavit, signed by the respondent, setting out the alleged facts necessary to show a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
This affidavit should have included the factual allegations underlying the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.¿FN1º The sworn affidavit should have also included the contractual agreement with the former counsel. The sworn affidavit should have also indicated that the respondent has notified the former counsel of the allegation of ineffective assistance, enabling the former counsel to respond to the allegations. In addition, the sworn affidavit should have indicated that a complaint has been filed against the former counsel with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. See Matter of Grijalva, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to so depart, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

Because the factual statements in the brief are not sworn to be true, they are not evidence. Motions or briefs, containing legal argument, must be accompanied by a sworn statement of a person having personal knowledge of the facts alleged. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Cf. Matter of G-, 20 I&N Dec. 764 (BIA 1993); Matter of Laureano, 19 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 1983).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mark P. Murphy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) º - Controlled substance violation
Sec. 212(a)(9)(g)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(A)(ii)º - Aliens previously removed
 
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; waiver of inadmissibility; adjustment of status
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s March 2, 2005, decision finding the respondent removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. The appeal will be dismissed.¿FN1º
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on May 9, 1984. The record reveals that on April 22, 1988, the respondent pleaded guilty to and was convicted of the Texas offense of unlawfull possession of a controlled substance, cocaine (Exh. 2 at Attachment).¿FN2º On December 2, 1992, the respondent pleaded guilty to and was convicted of the New York offense of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (Exh. 2 at Attachment). Thereafter, the Department of Homeland Security, (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service), commenced removal proceedings against the respondent charging him with removability under sections 237(a)(2)(B), and (C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B), (C) (Exh. 2 at Attachment). An Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States to Jamaica on May 21, 1998 (Exh. 2 at Attachment).¿FN3º The respondent was removed from this country on September 24, 1998 (Exh. 2 at Attachment).
 
On December 11, 1998, the respondent attempted to re-enter this country, without advance consent from the Attorney General, by presenting a revoked resident alien card (Exh. 2 at Attachment). The respondent was subsequently convicted of attempting to re-enter the United States after deportation (Exh. 2 at Attachment). Thereafter, the DHS commenced removal proceedings against the respondent alleging that the respondent was removable as one inadmissible at entry both as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation as described in section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), and as an alien previously removed as described in section 212(a)(9)(A)(ii) of the Act.
 
The respondent on appeal challenges his removability and asserts, in part, that the first order of removal was unlawful and unfair because he was not considered for relief for which he was eligible. The respondent’s arguments are without merit.
 
*2 As an initial matter, the record reveals that the DHS presented clear and convincing evidence establishing the respondent’s removability as charged in both proceedings (Exhs. 2, 3). Turning to the issue of relief from removal, the respondent has failed to establish eligibility for both cancellation of removal and a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act. With respect to cancellation of removal, as the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent has not demonstrated the requisite 7 years of residence. See section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). Contrary to the respondent’s arguments on appeal, the respondent’s 1988 controlled substance conviction ended the respondent’s continuous residence for cancellation purposes. See Matter of Perez, 22 I&N Dec. 689 (BIA 1999); See also Matter of K-S-, 20 I&N Dec. 715 (BIA 1993) (explaining that the Board is not bound to follow the published decision of a United States district court even in cases arising within the same district).
 
With respect to section 212(c) relief, although it appears that the respondent may have been statutorily eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility for his 1988 controlled substance conviction before his earlier removal, such relief has not been shown to have been available for the respondent’s 1992 firearms conviction. See Matter of Montenegro, 20 I&N Dec. 603 (BIA 1992). While the firearms conviction did not constitute a ground of inadmissibility that would preclude the respondent from seeking adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, the record contains no evidence establishing the respondent’s prima facie eligibility to pursue adjustment of status in conjunction with a 212(c) waiver for the 1988 drug conviction. See Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750 (BIA 1993). Furthermore, as the Immigration Judge noted, the record contains evidence indicating that the respondent may have a recent (1998) aggravated felony conviction, which would not qualify for a section 212(c) waiver (Exh. 2 at Attachment). In addition, we believe it would be inconsistent with the purpose of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(k) to allow the respondent to collaterally attack his prior removal in circumstances where the regulation would bar reopening of that same proceeding
 
On whole, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s resolution. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent’s appellate fee waiver request is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3)(2005).

2

The record reveals that, pursuant to a nunc pro tunc order entered on February 17, 2005, the respondent’s controlled substance conviction is still valid, i.e., it has not been vacated or set aside (Exh. 3). Notably, even if the respondent’s conviction had been set aside, under the circumstances, the respondent’s conviction would still count as a conviction for immigration purposes. See generally Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N 621, 623-24 (BIA 2003) (explaining that a respondent remains “convicted” for immigration purposes where the conviction is vacated for reasons unrelated to the merits of the underlying criminal proceedings).

3

Notably, contrary to the respondent’s assertion, the respondent appealed that decision on July 7, 2003. Noting that departure constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal, the Board properly dismissed the respondent’s appeal on February 27, 2004. Furthermore, to the extent the respondent claims ineffective assistance of counsel in relation to that appeal, he has not sufficiently shown patent error or complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).

IN RE: ANDRE PAUL NEWTON
File: AXX XX4 839 - Atlanta
May 4, 2005
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 In an order entered on October 20, 1999, we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent reportedly was removed from the United States on October 4, 2002. On November 29, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen shall not be made by a person who is the subject of removal proceedings subsequent to his departure from the United States. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d).
 
We summarily dismissed the appeal because the respondent, then represented by counsel, failed to file a separate brief or statement after indicating the intention to do so. The respondent argues that he was deprived, due to ineffective assistance of counsel, of the opportunity to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to the former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). It is argued that the prior proceedings were fundamentally unfair, and that the respondent should consequently be allowed to apply for section 212(c) relief. The respondent cites two cases decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in support of his argument, United States v. Fernandez-Antonia, 278 F.3d 150 (2nd Cir. 2002); and United States v. Perez, 330 F.3d 97 (2nd Cir. 2003).
 
We note that the respondent remained in the United States for 3 years after our order was issued, until he was removed, and there is no indication that he attempted to reopen proceedings during that time on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent’s motion has been filed within the Second Circuit’s jurisdiction, since he is detained in New York and is reportedly in criminal proceedings related to his reentry after being removed. However, neither of the Second Circuit cases cited by the respondent compels, in our view, the reopening of proceedings. The respondent’s firearms conviction rendered him ineligible for section 212(c) relief. See, e.g., Matter of Saint John, 21 I&N Dec. 593 (BIA 1996); Matter of Hernandez-Casillas, 20 I&N Dec. 262 (BIA 1990, A.G. 1991). The respondent has not shown that he has a qualifying relative through whom he could adjust his status, so he cannot rely on our holding in Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750 (BIA 1993), to garner section 212(c) relief. The respondent failed to exercise due diligence when he did not challenge the effectiveness of his counsel in the 3 years between the issuance of our order and his removal. Further, the respondent has failed to demonstrate any significant degree of compliance with our holding in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1 st Cir. 1988).
 
*2 Consequently, the respondent has not been deprived of pursuing section 212(c) relief, due to his ineligibility therefor. The respondent has not demonstrated that the prior proceedings were unfair; it is the pretermission of consideration for section 212(c) relief that is specifically challenged, and not the charges of removability. It has not been demonstrated how prior counsel’s assistance prevented the respondent’s applying for a relief for which he was not, and is not, eligible.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eric G. Bjotvedt, Esquire
 
REISSUED DECISION
 
*1 We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on November 14, 2002. On March 23, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). We will reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and reissue our previous decision.
 
The respondent alleges that his former attorney failed to inform him about our prior decision, so he was unable to file a petition for review with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.
 
We find that the respondent has met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988). According to our records, our November 14, 2002, decision was returned as undeliverable, and the respondent presents evidence that former counsel has had an office at numerous addresses. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, and we will treat the motion as unopposed. The Board’s decision will be reissued and treated as if entered on today’s date. See Firmansjah v. Ashcroft, 347 F.3d 625 (7th Cir. 2003) (Board has authority to reissue decision).
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reissue is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated November 14, 2002, attached hereto, is hereby reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.

File: AXX XX0 200 - Los Angeles

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ming Gang Li, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. An Immigration Judge issued an order of removal against the respondent on February 10, 2004. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of the Immigration Judge’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38. The appeal was filed untimely on June 7, 2004. In conjunction with the appeal, the respondent, through counsel, requests that the Board accept the late appeal. The request, to which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded, will be denied, and the appeal will be dismissed as untimely.
 
The appeal was due on March 11, 2004. Counsel for the respondent argues that she believed that she was supposed to file the appeal with the immigration court rather than the Board. However, counsel refers to long-expired regulations to support this contention. Additionally, the respondent’s counsel’s letter suggests that she was already specifically on notice, via notice from another immigration court, that the appeal had to be filed with the Board. In any event, there is no proof submitted that the respondent actually tried to submit the appeal to the immigration court, as counsel claims.
 
Moreover, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). As for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, these cases require that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. The respondent has complied with none of these requirements.
 
We find that the appeal is untimely. The Immigration Judge’s decision is now final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.52, 1240.53, and 1241.31 (1999).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Adria-Ann McMurray
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Larry Gallagher
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This matter was last before the Board on September 8, 2004, at which time we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondents’ applications for cancellation of removal and granting the alternative relief of voluntary departure. The respondents have filed a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not filed an opposition. The motion will be granted as set forth below.
 
The respondents seek reopening so that they may file a brief on the merits of their appeal. They assert that, unbeknownst to them, their prior counsel failed to file a brief. Specifically, they assert that they hired their prior counsel, David A. Diaz, to file an appeal and to file applications for work permits, and that Mr. Diaz “was supposed to file a written legal brief” on appeal (Motion at Exh. E). They diligently tried to contact their counsel on a regular basis to learn the status of their proceedings. After the male respondent’s employer threatened to fire him unless he got a new work permit, the respondents hired their present counsel. Through present counsel, the respondents learned that Mr. Diaz never filed a brief and that he had been placed on inactive status with the State Bar of California. A few weeks thereafter, the male respondent confronted Mr. Diaz, and Mr. Diaz acknowledged his wrongdoing, apologized, and promised to write a letter to the Board. The respondents promptly filed a motion to late-file a brief; however, the motion was received by the Board after we issued our decision. Because Mr. Diaz was counsel of record at the time the Board’s decision was issued, the decision was mailed to him. He did not forward it to the respondents. As a result, they did not learn of the Board’s decision until after the voluntary departure period had expired.
 
The respondents have sufficiently complied with the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), including having filed a complaint with the State Bar of California. To warrant reopening based on the ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondents must also demonstrate that they were prejudiced by counsel’s failure to file a brief, Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). We conclude that the male respondent is unable to demonstrate prejudice with respect to cancellation of removal because, as a matter of law, he cannot demonstrate the requisite period of continuous physical presence due to his departures in 1998 and 1999 under threat of deportation. Matter of Romalez, 23 I&N Dec. 423 (BIA 2002). However, we conclude that the male respondent was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance to the extent that he was unaware of the Board’s decision and, specifically, the voluntary departure order. Under these exceptional circumstances, we will grant the motion to reopen proceedings in AXX XXX XXX to the extent that our September 8, 2004, order will be reissued in that case. With respect to the female respondent, out of an abundance of caution we will grant the motion to reopen to permit her to file a brief on the merits in AXX XXX XXX. See Singh v. Ashcroft, 362 F.3d 1164 (9th Cir. 2004). A transcript will be issued to the respondent, and a briefing schedule will be set by separate order.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen proceedings in AXX XXX XXX is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen proceedings in AXX XXX XXX is granted to the extent that the Board’s September 8, 2004, decision is hereby reissued in AXX XXX XXX.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent in AXX XXX XXX is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent in AXX XXX XXX fails to so depart, the respondent in AXX XXX XXX shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent in AXX XXX XXX fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent in AXX XXX XXX shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN RE: ADAMA DIANE
File: AXX XX0 474 - New York

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT:
 
Jan Allen Reiner, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Chartrisse Adlam
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board on May 12, 2004. We have jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 8 CFR § 1003.2(a). The motion will be granted and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
The record reflects that the respondent failed to appear for the noticed hearing on June 11, 1999, and the respondent was ordered deported in absentia. The respondent’s motion to reopen the deportation proceedings was denied by the Immigration Judge on August 26, 1999. When this case was initially before the Board on November 13, 2001, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the denial of the motion to reopen. Through a new attorney, the respondent on May 12, 2004, filed a motion to reopen his deportation proceedings to rescind the in absentia order of deportation against him to pursue relief from deportation. The respondent contends that his prior counsel’s ineffective assistance of counsel amounts to “exceptional circumstances” for purposes of rescinding an in absentia order of deportation.
 
We note that the respondent’s motion is both time and numerically barred from consideration. See Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998); Matter of A-A, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998) (holding that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception of the 180-day statutory limit for the filing of a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia order of deportation under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252 b(c)(3)(A) on the basis of exceptional circumstances). However, in Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000), the court recognized the doctrine of “equitable tolling” of the statute of limitations regarding the filing of a motion to reopen. The court held that an alien must demonstrate not only that the alien’s constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll. Id. In that case, the court concluded that the alien failed to demonstrate such diligence, and concluded the equitable tolling did not apply. Id.
 
Accordingly, under Iavorski v. INS, supra, the Board must first address whether the respondent was denied due process in these proceedings based upon the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved applicant setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representation counsel did or did not make to the applicant in this regard; (2) the counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id at 640.
 
*2 In the instant case, we have reviewed the documents submitted with the instant motion and find that the respondent may have been the victim of negligence. We note that the record contains a statement of Mr. Kleefield in reply to the respondent’s complaint, wherein Mr. Kleefield indicates that he is old and trying his best. It also appears that counsel did little to keep the respondent informed of the status of his hearing. We therefore conclude that the respondent did not fail to exercise due diligence in seeking reopening, and we find that reopening is appropriate. We also note that the respondent appears eligible to reopen under Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). He appears prima facie eligible to adjust his status, and since the motion is joint, there are no time restrictions. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be granted.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sunit K. Joshi, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Richard VanVeldhuisen,
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on October 31, 2002, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s applications for relief and ordering his removal to China. The respondent filed the instant motion on January 21, 2005. It is untimely whether considered a motion to reconsider or a motion to reopen. See sections 240(c)(5)(B), (6)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § § 1229a(c)(5)(B), (6)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b), (c) (providing 30 days to file a motion to reconsider and 90 days to file a motion to reopen). See also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
To the extent that the respondent is arguing that the untimeliness is due to ineffective assistance of counsel, he has failed to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). He has also not articulated an adequate basis for tolling the statutory and regulatory deadlines for motions under Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 130 (2d Cir. 2000) (finding deadline for motions to reopen deportation proceedings may be equitably tolled, but alien failed to exercise due diligence required for equitable tolling). Even if his prior counsel was ineffective in failing to timely advise him of our dismissal of his appeal, the respondent learned in August 2003 that his appeal had been dismissed, and he failed to exercise due diligence because he delayed filing a motion until January 2005. Accordingly, the motion is denied as untimely.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Arik Ben-Ezra, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (all respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopen
 
This case was last before us on May 9, 2002, when we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s August 24, 1999, denial of the respondents’ applications for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The respondents now move to reopen their case arguing that their prior attorneys provided ineffective assistance of counsel and that they are eligible for cancellation of removal.
 
We have previously outlined the threshold requirements for having an ineffective assistance of counsel claim considered. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004). In addition to the threshold requirements, an alien must demonstrate that he or she suffered prejudice as a result of the prior counsel’s actions. We initially observe that the non-citizen daughter, Andrea (AXX XXX XXX), does not have an effective Lozada claim. She argues that her prior attorneys did not attempt to establish that she was independently eligible for cancellation of removal. We observe, however, that the Act clearly requires that an alien must have a qualifying relative to be eligible for relief. See section 240A(b)(1)(D). There is no qualifying relative upon whom the non-citizen daughter can base her hardship requirement. Thus, we do not find that the non-citizen daughter established prejudice.
 
Similarly, we do not find that the lead respondent or his wife established prejudice. The Immigration Judge below found that the lead respondent and his wife met the physical presence and good moral character requirements. Thus, the only remaining requirement was whether the lead respondent and his wife demonstrated that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to their qualifying relatives. See section 240A(b)(1). To be eligible for cancellation of removal, hardship must be substantially beyond that which ordinarily would be expected to result from the alien’s deportation. See Matter of Monreal, 23 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2001). Even considering all of the new arguments included in the motion to reopen, we do not find that the respondent and his wife have demonstrated hardship factors rising to the level of hardship articulated in Matter of Recinas, 23 I&N Dec. 467, 470 (commenting that the hardship circumstances present in the case constitute the outer limit of the narrow spectrum of cases in which the exceptional and extremely unusual hardship standard will be met). Unlike in Recinas, the burden of supporting a family does not fall upon one individual. Furthermore, the lead respondent and his wife have family in Mexico who they could stay with and have fewer children than the single mother in Recinas. We therefore conclude that the lead respondent and his wife cannot establish their eligibility for cancellation of removal and have failed to demonstrate that they were prejudiced by their prior attorneys’ actions. See Matter of Lozada, supra
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is dismissed.

IN RE: FERNANDO MENDIOLA SANCHEZ
File: A27 553 533 - San Francisco
April 14, 2005
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Helen A. Sklar, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Evan R. Franke
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We sustained an appeal of the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service), and found the respondent and his son, Mario Mendiola Araujo, A75 260 1811, ineligible for suspension of deportation, on July 18, 2002. The respondent then filed a motion to reopen seeking adjustment of status. We denied this motion to reopen as untimely on June 4, 2004. More than 6 months later, and represented by the same law firm, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen on December 16, 2004. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, the motion exceeds the numerical limitations for motions to reopen. Id. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that the deadline for filing the motion to reopen should be tolled. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has found that the motion to reopen period may be tolled due to “deception, fraud, or error.” Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1185-86 (9th Cir. 2004). As the DHS argues, any “error” here amounts to negligence on the part of counsel who still represents the respondent. The respondent’s attorney, Helen A. Sklar, states that she was unaware that the motions filing deadline would result in our June 4, 2004, decision which denied the respondent’s previous motion to reopen as untimely. Yet even after that decision, which was consistent with the pertinent regulations, and clearly said that the motion was dismissed as untimely, counsel made no effort to submit this motion claiming “ineffective assistance of counsel” until after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled on our original decision in this case in the summer of 2004.
 
In any event, the respondent fails to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62 (BIA 2003). As for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, those cases require that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525-526 (9th Cir. 2000)(Lozada requirements generally reasonable, but full compliance is not required if the record independently shows that the “ineffective assistance” claim is legitimate and substantial). The respondent here declines to make a complaint against counsel. The Board in Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 603-605 (BIA 1996), gave several reasons for the “bar complaint” requirement. We noted that the requirement protects against collusion between aliens and counsel in which “ineffective assistance” is used to achieve delay. Id. We found that the bar complaint, like the other filings required by Matter of Lozada, supra, greatly aids us in adjudicating the claim. Id. We also stated that the filing of such a complaint is a “relatively small inconvenience” for an alien seeking a new hearing after proceedings have been concluded at great government expense. Id. The disciplinary process could consider, and evaluate, the actions taken by former counsel. Matter of Rivera-Claros, supra; see also Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 596 (9th Cir. 2004) (“¿rºequiring sworn affidavits and formal grievance letters reduces petitioners’ ability to slip meritless claims past the Board”); compare Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra, at fn 11 (alien not required to submit a bar complaint in case where attorney had been subject to numerous counts of violations of professional ethics and had been punished by the Supreme Court of California).
 
*2 The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sam Shihab, Esquire
 
REISSUED DECISION
 
*1 We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on April 8, 2003. On January 25, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). We will reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and reissue our previous decision.
 
The respondent alleges that his former attorney failed to inform him of our earlier decision, so that he could file a petition for review with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, or depart voluntarily under the terms of our prior order. Contrary to the argument of the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service), we find that the respondent has met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Former counsel submitted a disciplinary complaint against himself with the Texas state bar, in which former counsel admits that he and the respondent had a “communication breakdown” after our April 8, 2003, decision. Specifically, former counsel lost his cell phone — which was listed as his contact number — after we issued our previous decision, and an unknown person reactivated the service so that the respondent was able to leave messages which never reached former counsel. Former counsel admits that the respondent “thought he was leaving me messages”, which in fact were never received. The respondent in his affidavit says that he tried to keep in contact with former counsel monthly via the cell phone number, and provided updated contact information via that number. The respondent states also in his affidavit that he later tried to contact former counsel at a new telephone number he received from another attorney in early 2004, but former counsel did not return his call. The Board’s decision will be reissued and treated as if entered on today’s date. See Firmansjah v. Ashcroft, 347 F.3d 625 (7th Cir. 2003)(Board has authority to reissue decision).
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reissue is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated April 8, 2003, attached hereto, is hereby reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Walter Burrier, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reissuance of Board decision
 
This case was last before this Board on October 7, 2004, when we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal as the statement in the Notice of Appeal failed to meaningfully apprise this Board of the reason underlying the appeal. The Notice of Appeal indicated only: “Reasons to be submitted in brief form later.” The respondent now moves this Board to reissue that decision due to alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent asserts ineffective assistance of former counsel in timely notifying him of this Board’s October 7, 2004, decision. The respondent asks this Board to reissue our prior order so that he may petition for review of that decision in federal court. With his motion the respondent submits a statement, not an affidavit, that he met with Ana Zhang from Zhongmei Immigration Service and paid her to assist in his appeal. The motion contains a copy of a business card with Ms. Zhang’s name and the name and address of Bayley and Associates. The respondent also presents a copy of an “Immigration Fee Agreement” between the law offices of Guy R. Bayley and the respondent. The agreement specifically states the services to be rendered: “Asylum case handled through any notice of appeal to BIA, excluding any briefing to BIA.” The respondent states that he never met with Mr. Bayley. A timely Notice of Appeal and Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney was filed by Mr. Bayley before this Board on September 10, 2003. The respondent heard that a decision on his appeal could take over a year. The respondent went to check the status of his appeal with Ms. Zhang and learned that the office had closed and was occupied by another business. The respondent had assistance in contacting this Board by phone and found out on November 29, 2004, that a decision had been issued on October 7, 2004. The motion also contains a copy of an unaddressed letter from the respondent’s present counsel to Mr. Bayley, informing him that he would be contacting the State Bar of California and filing the instant motion before the Board. The respondent’s present counsel has also sent a complaint letter to the State Bar of California.
 
Even if we were to find that the evidence submitted with the motion to reopen substantially comports with the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), we do not find good cause to reissue our prior order. This Board has on occasion reissued its decisions, but only due to Board error or administrative problems involving receipt of the Board’s decision. See, e.g., Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968 (9th Cir. 2004). In the instant case the respondent does not allege any error on the part of the Board in serving its decision to former counsel, and the record does not reflect that our decision was returned or undeliverable to the address of former counsel, which is the same address noted by the respondent in his motion. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(f); 1292.4(a), 1292.5(a) (2004).1 We, therefore, do not find good cause to reissue our prior order.
 
*2 In addition, the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by the claimed ineffective assistance of former counsel in pursuing his appeal before this Board. Although the respondent was unable to file a timely petition for review before the federal court of this Board’s decision, the respondent has not shown that this Board erred in summarily dismissing his appeal. The respondent has never filed a brief or alleged any error of law or fact in the decision of the Immigration Judge. The respondent’s motion to reissue our decision does not also contain a motion to reopen in order to consider the merits of his appeal due to alleged ineffective assistance of his prior attorney. See generally Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). Thus, we cannot find that there was any prejudice to the respondent in the purported ineffective assistance of his former counsel. Accordingly, the motion to reissue our prior decision is denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reissue our decision is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patrice Perillie, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Evalyn Douchy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent’s motion to reopen has been filed years out of time and will be denied. An Immigration Judge denied the respondent suspension of deportation1 on March 1, 1999. On March 29, 1999, present counsel Patrice Perillie, then associated with Wilens & Baker law firm, submitted a Notice of Appeal to the Board. On March 30, 1999, we rejected the appeal for filing defects, because the check submitted by the respondent was not signed. The March 30, 1999, notice was sent to Perillie. Almost 4 months later, on July 26, 1999, another attorney at Wilens & Baker sought to submit the appeal late. The appeal was filed on July 26, 1999, with Perillie listed as counsel of record. On September 24, 1999, the appeal was dismissed as untimely, and the decision was mailed to Perillie. More than 5 years later, on January 10, 2005, the respondent has filed an untimely motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(e)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
There is no adequate excuse provided for the extreme lateness of the pending motion. The respondent makes a claim against Wilens and Baker, but as the DHS argues, the Notice of Appeal was filed by current counsel, who was an associate at that law firm.
 
Even were the motions deadline tolled, the motion would be denied. As the DHS argues, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). As for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, Matter of Assaad, supra, and Matter of Lozada, supra, require that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. See Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108, 119 (2d Cir. 1993). Here, there is no evidence that the respondent gave the complained-about counsel the opportunity to respond to the allegations of ineffectiveness. Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matt Kurilich, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kathryn E. Steuver
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; termination of proceedings
 
The respondent has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s decision, dated October 21, 2003. We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, with the following comments. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the ¿Iºmmigration ¿Jºudge articulated in his or her decision).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the ineffective assistance of counsel has deprived him of due process. We have reviewed the record and conclude that the respondent has failed to demonstrate that counsel’s performance was inadequate or that it was so inadequate that it prejudiced the outcome of proceedings. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 894-97 (9th Cir. 2003) (ineffective assistance of counsel at a deportation hearing may result in a denial of due process under the Fifth Amendment only when proceeding is so fundamentally unfair that the alien is prevented from reasonably presenting his claim). There is no evidence in the record that respondent’s previous counsel prevented the respondent from having a fair opportunity to present his applications for relief. See e.g. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) citing Ramirez-Durazo v. INS, 794 F.2d 491 (9th Cir. 1986); Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015 (9th Cir. 1985) (alien must show not merely ineffective assistance of counsel, but assistance which is so ineffective as to have impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing in violation of the fifth amendment due process clause).
 
Accordingly, in view of the above, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
E. Dennis Muchnicki, Esquire
 
REISSUED DECISION
 
*1 We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on December 31, 2002, and denied a motion to reconsider on May 21, 2003. On February 2, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). We will reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and reissue our December 31, 2002, decision dismissing the respondent’s appeal.
 
The respondent alleges that his former attorney, Don L. Chadwick, provided ineffective assistance of counsel, in that he submitted an inadequate motion to reconsider rather than a timely petition for review with the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals challenging our final order of removal. Indeed, the Seventh Circuit, in Ahmed v. Ashcroft, 388 F.3d 247, 249 (7th Cir. 2004), while affirming our May 21, 2003, decision, determined that the respondent’s action in filing a motion to reconsider “as a vehicle for a belated appeal from the order of removal” was improper. The respondent has met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. 637 (BIA1988). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, and we will treat the motion as unopposed. The Board’s decision will be reissued and treated as if entered on today’s date. See Firmansjah v. Ashcroft, 347 F.3d 625 (7th Cir. 2003)(Board has authority to reissue decision).
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reissue is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated December 31, 2002, attached hereto, is hereby reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law (both respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on September 1, 2004, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s August 1, 2003, decision denying the respondents’ motion to reopen and rescind the order of removal entered in absentia on February 19, 2003. The respondents’ current motion to reopen is granted.
 
In our prior decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondents’ motion to reopen and rescind the order of removal entered in absentia, we found that the record supported the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondents had failed to establish “exceptional circumstances” sufficient to excuse their absence from immigration court on February 19, 2003. The Board declined to consider the evidence and arguments proffered by the respondents for the first time on appeal. See Matter of Obaigbena, 19 I&N Dec. 533 (BIA 1988). The Board also concluded that the respondents had failed to satisfy their burden in supporting their assertion that they were the victims of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). However, through their current motion, we find that the respondents have successfully complied with Matter of Lozada, supra. Moreover, the respondents have established that the reason for their failure to appear was beyond their control and, therefore, have shown “exceptional circumstances” excusing their failure to appear on February 19, 2003.
 
Accordingly, the motion is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Justin Conlon, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the board on February 19, 2002, when we denied the respondent’s motion as untimely filed. On February 7, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board pursuant to the Stipulation and Order of Settlement and Withdrawal of the United States District Court, District of Connecticut, dated January 10, 2005. The District Court’s Order vacates all prior decisions of both the Board of Immigration Appeals and the Immigration Court in this matter, and remands the matter to the Board for a determination as to whether the respondent has satisfied the requirements of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Furthermore, once the Board has determined that the respondent has satisfied the requirements under Matter of Lozada, the Board will remand to the Immigration Judge for a hearing on the respondent’s applications for relief.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, supra. Matter of Lozada requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. See also Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 130 (2nd Cir. 2000) (the deadline for motions to reopen deportation proceedings may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
As noted by the respondent, her case has a very complicated procedural history. In her most recent motion, she is alleging that four of her prior attorneys committed ineffective assistance of counsel in representing her. The respondent has set forth in detail all of her separate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has submitted detailed affidavits outlining the agreements reached with all of her prior attorneys concerning their representation; she has notified all of her prior attorneys (which she could contact) of the ineffective assistance claims that she is raising; and she has filed a complaint with the relevant disciplinary authorities against all of the attorneys that have represented her, who have not been disbarred. The respondent has either complied, or substantially complied, with all of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, for each of the attorneys against whom she alleges ineffective assistance of counsel. The record in the instant case supports the conclusion that based on the totality of circumstances, the respondent has established exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear. Consequently, we find that the respondent has presented valid claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and the proceedings will be reopened and remanded for further proceedings.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Christopher J. Todd, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (all respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on October 6, 2004, when we denied the respondents’ motion to reopen, based upon alleged ineffective assistance of counsel and the respondents’ motion to hold in abeyance our decision on the respondents’ motion to reopen until the respondents were able to comply with the requirements of our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). On October 21, 2004, the respondents filed a timely motion to reconsider, arguing that the Board failed to consider the evidence submitted by the respondents as a supplement to their motion to reopen. The respondents maintain that the Board received the supplement to the pending motion to reopen on September 22, 2004, over 2 weeks prior to the issuance of the Board’s October 6, 2004, decision denying the respondents’ motion to reopen. The respondents’ motion will be granted, the respondents’ removal proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
Due to the Board’s failure to consider the respondents’ supplement to their motion to reopen, we will grant the respondents’ motion to reconsider. In the respondents’ supplement to their motion to reopen, the respondents request reopening due to the ineffective assistance of their prior counsel. Specifically, the respondents argue that their prior counsel failed to present evidence regarding the lead respondent’s history of abuse by her husband and the learning disability suffered by the lead respondent’s United States citizen son. The respondents also claim that their prior counsel failed to properly prepare them for their hearing before the Immigration Judge.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, supra. In Matter of Lozada, supra, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that an alien need not fulfill all the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel when the record reflects a clear and obvious case of such. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that attorney’s failure to timely file a suspension of deportation application was negligence); see also Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000). In addition to the three procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, it is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating that a due process violation requires a showing of prejudice, which can be made if counsel’s performance “was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings”).
 
*2 The record reflects that the respondents have fully complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Furthermore, we find that the respondents have established that they suffered prejudice as a result of their counsel’s ineffectiveness, insofar as the failure of the respondents’ counsel to present evidence relevant to the hardship that the lead respondent’s two United States citizens sons may face in Mexico may have potentially affected the outcome of these proceedings. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating that a due process violation requires a showing of prejudice, which can be made if counsel’s performance “was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings”). Since the respondents have complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, and established prejudice by their prior counsel’s ineffective assistance, we grant the respondents’ motion to reopen and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. Moreover, we note that the respondents have presented in the supplement to their motion to reopen new and previously unavailable evidence regarding hardship for cancellation of removal and eligibility for withholding of removal that should be considered by the Immigration Judge on remand. Accordingly, the respondents’ motion to reconsider is granted, the respondents’ removal proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Anthony D. Agpaoa, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa M. Koven
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondents’ motion to reopen has been filed out of time. We dismissed the respondents’ appeal on August 9, 2004. The motion to reopen was submitted late on December 21, 2004. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondents argue that the deadline for filing the motion to reopen should be tolled. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has found that the motion to reopen period may be tolled due to “deception, fraud, or error.” Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1185-86 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondents’ affidavit does not establish that their former attorney deceived them about the Board’s dismissal of the appeal, and does not establish when they sought out new counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir.2003) (court found that to the extent that equitable tolling applies, based on actions of prior counsel, limitations period begins when respondent meets with new counsel and learns of fraud).
 
In any event, the respondents fail to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62 (BIA 2003). As for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, those cases require that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525-526 (9th Cir. 2000)(Lozada requirements generally reasonable, but full compliance is not required if the record independently shows that the “ineffective assistance” claim is legitimate and substantial). The respondents here are only “considering” making a complaint against former counsel. The Board in Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 603-605 (BIA 1996), gave several reasons for the “bar complaint” requirement. We noted that the requirement protects against collusion between aliens and counsel in which “ineffective assistance” is used to achieve delay. Id. We found that the bar complaint, like the other filings required by Matter of Lozada, supra, greatly aids us in adjudicating the claim. Id. We also stated that the filing of such a complaint is a “relatively small inconvenience” for an alien seeking a new hearing after proceedings have been concluded at great government expense. Id. The disciplinary process could consider, and evaluate, the actions taken by former counsel. Matter of Rivera-Claros, supra; see also Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 596 (9th Cir. 2004) (“¿rºequiring sworn affidavits and formal grievance letters reduces petitioners’ ability to slip meritless claims past the Board”); compare Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra, at fn. 11 (alien not required to submit a bar complaint in case where attorney had been subject to numerous counts of violations of professional ethics and had been punished by the Supreme Court of California).
 
*2 The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Emilio Amaya
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal is untimely. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was rendered orally on November 5, 2004. The appeal was accordingly due on or before December 6, 2004. The record reflects, however, that the Notice of Appeal was mailed after the due date and filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on January 14, 2005. We accordingly find that the appeal is untimely. In conjunction with the appeal the respondents claim ineffecitve assistance of counsel, asserting that prior counsel failed to file their appeal. However, the respondents have failed to meet the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), in order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondents have failed to submit a detailed statement of their agreement with Fred Browne, there is no evidence that the respondents informed prior counsel of the allegations against him, and it does not appear that the California Bar complaint was actually filed1. Nor have the respondents established that they were prejudiced by any ineffective assistance of counsel. See Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000), amended by 213 F.3d 1221 (9th Cir. 2000). Therefore, we do not find this claim to be an adequate reason to consider this appeal by certification. The Immigration Judge’s decision is therefore now final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.
 
We note that because we have dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J- J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).

APPLICATION: Remand; cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(b) of the Act
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondents have appealed the Immigration Judge’s September 25, 2003, decision to deny their request for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The respondents argue that we should remand the record because of their prior counsel’s ineffective assistance. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639, we held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the claim reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not.
 
The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the respondents’ motion because there is no evidence that the respondents’ former counsel has been informed of the charges against her and given an opportunity to respond. The respondents contend, by way of a vague declarative statement, that they notified their prior counsel of the charges by telephone.
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the circuit in which this case arises, recently issued a decision regarding Lozada’s notice requirement. In Reyes v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2003), the alien sent a letter regarding the ineffectiveness of the alien’s prior counsel to the California State Bar. The letter included a line stating “cc” and the prior counsel’s name. Reyes v. Ashcroft, supra. The court observed that the “cc” notation, at best, indicated that the alien intended on sending the prior counsel notice of the state disciplinary proceedings, but that the respondent offered no evidence that he sent the prior counsel notice of the state disciplinary proceedings. Id. at 1131. Furthermore, the court noted that the alien failed to give the prior counsel notice of his motion to reopen. Id. at 1131-1132. The court emphasized that the purpose of Lozada’s notice requirement is to encourage the prior counsel to contest the allegations of ineffective assistance so that the adjudicator can more accurately assess the claim of ineffective assistance. Id. at 1132. Inasmuch as the alien provided no evidence that the prior counsel received the notice of the motion to reopen and did not give the prior counsel an opportunity to respond to the allegations, the court held that the alien failed to comply with Lozada’s notice requirement. Id.
 
*2 In the instant case, neither the respondents’ letter to the disciplinary authorities nor any affidavit from the respondents themselves or their current counsel indicate that a copy was sent to the respondents’ prior counsel. We also note that the respondents have not provided an affidavit regarding any communications with their prior counsel. Therefore, we find that the mere assertion that notice was given without any other evidence is insufficient to establish that the respondents substantially complied with Lozada’s notice requirement. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, supra. Inasmuch as the respondents do not appeal any other portion of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the appeal is dismissed and the motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondents are permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS, formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondents fail to so depart, the respondents shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondents fail to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondents shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

File: AXX XX6 166 - New York

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ashley Mammo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Richard VanVeldhuisen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on May 24, 2004, when we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 20, 2003, for failure to file a brief in accordance with 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(D). On January 12, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of his first attorney due to that counsel’s failure to file an appeal brief, and requesting reopening on the basis of changed country conditions in Guinea. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
First, the motion to reopen is untimely. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on May 24, 2004. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before August 24, 2004. The record reflects that the respondent’s motion was filed on January 12, 2005. Consequently, the respondent’s motion is not properly before us for consideration. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
Second, even assuming arguendo we assumed jurisdiction, the motion would be denied. We consider that although the respondent has generally complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), he has not shown that his former counsel acted ineffectively. He argues that his former counsel was obligated to file the appeal brief and provided ineffective assistance when he failed to do so. The Board, however, has held that satisfying the above procedural requirements is in and of itself an insufficient reason to reopen, and that an attorney’s failure to file an appeal on behalf of an alien is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Id. This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id.
 
The respondent has failed to identify the substantive arguments he would have raised on appeal but for counsel’s ineffectiveness which prevented him from fully presenting his appellate arguments. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226 (9th Cir. 2002) (ineffective assistance of counsel is a due process violation if the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his or her case due to fundamental unfairness of the proceedings). Consequently, although the respondent has generally met the requirements of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, supra, he has not shown that he suffered prejudice that affected the outcome of his case. See Matter of Assaad, supra.
 
*2 Finally, we find that the respondent has not proffered any material new evidence that was previously unavailable, as to changed country conditions in Guinea, or in any other regard, in support of his motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1242.22, 1003.2, and 1003.8. Moreover, he has not supported his motion with any applications for relief from removal and deportation, including asylum, and has failed to establish prima facie eligibility for the relief requested. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 470-474 (BIA 1992).
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David Swaim, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sabrina Hall,
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves to reopen and remand the proceedings for consideration of an application for adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion. Although this motion is untimely, the respondent submits it should be excused from the usual time limitations because she had ineffective assistance of counsel from attorney Daniel W. Son, Jr. Although the respondent has included with this motion a detailed affidavit stating what problems she encountered with her former attorney, a copy of the letter her current attorney wrote to Mr. Son, and Mr. Son’s reply letter, she also contends in this motion that she cannot fully comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). She explains that the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure prohibit any disclosure about whether a claim has been filed. Motion to Reopen at 7.
 
Holding aside the fact that this motion already appears to compromise the respondent’s interpretation of the Texas rule stated above, we find that the respondent has failed to prove she was prejudiced by Mr. Son’s representation. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). See also Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999). The evidence does not prove her prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. As an initial matter, the record does not contain a copy of the I-130 that was filed on the respondent’s behalf or an application for relief (I-485). Further, the qualifying marriage took place during proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 245.1(c)(9). Finally, there is an adverse credibility finding in the record, bearing on discretion (I.J. at 6). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly, we hold that reopening is not warranted.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent now appeals from the Immigration Judge’s denial of her application for cancellation of removal. See section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). Based on the respondent’s credible testimony and the statements on her written application, we reject the Immigration Judge’s finding that she failed to satisfy the “good moral character” requirement for the relief. See sections 240A(b)(1)(B) of the Act. See also Vera- Villegas v. INS, 330 F.3d 1222, 1225, 1230-31 (9th Cir. 2003). For the reasons set forth in the decision, however, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent failed to sustain her burden of proof with regard to the “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” requirement for the relief. See sections 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The respondent further contests the fairness of the removal hearings based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. She has failed, however, substantially to comply with the procedural requirements for such a claim. See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, 320 F.3d 1061(9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). She has also failed to put forth arguments and evidence to demonstrate that she suffered prejudice as a result of the attorney’s alleged mishandling of her case. See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, supra. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the alien fails to so depart, the alien shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

IN RE: JOSE LUIS IBARRA VASQUEZ
File: A96 340 637 - Los Angeles
February 28, 2005
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated December 16, 2004.1 In our prior decision, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“the Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), based on the fact that the respondent did not have a qualifying relative for purposes of section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act. The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
In his motion, the respondent contends that he does, in fact, have a United States citizen child but did not believe that he could claim the child as a qualifying relative because the respondent’s name was not correct on the child’s birth certificate. In support of his motion, the respondent has submitted a copy of the child’s birth certificate, which lists the respondent’s name as “Luis Ibarra Vasques,” rather than “Jose Luis Ibarra Vasquez.” The respondent maintains that he has filed an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his prior attorney as a result of this error.
 
We find that the respondent has failed to establish a basis for reopening proceedings. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Specifically, the respondent has failed to establish that the evidence he seeks to offer was not available and could not have been discovered or presented during proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, we do not find the respondent’s explanation that he did not believe he could claim the child due to the discrepancy on the birth certificate to be reasonable, particularly in light of the fact that the respondent was specifically questioned by the Immigration Judge as to whether he had any United States citizen children. See Tr. at 7-8. Furthermore, as the respondent has not alleged any specific hardship to the United States citizen child, he cannot establish prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act. See generally INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
Turning to the respondent’s claim against his former counsel, we find that the respondent has not meaningfully attempted to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See generally Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000). The only evidence that the respondent has even attempted to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, is a copy of a complaint form purportedly filed with the State Bar of California. The complaint form, however, is incomplete and does not describe the nature of the respondent’s complaint against his former counsel. Furthermore, the respondent has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by the actions of his former counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent has not claimed that his prior counsel was even aware of the existence of his alleged United States citizen child, nor has he claimed that he was advised by prior counsel not to reveal the existence of the child as a result of the error on the birth certificate.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
