IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ricardo Cavallera, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Marci L. Ellsworth
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; voluntary departure; adjustment of status; remand
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s May 5, 2003, decision finding him removable as charged and ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b), and voluntary departure. The respondent also requests a remand to apply for adjustment of status. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the record contains insufficient evidence to establish that he was convicted of an aggravated felony and, therefore, the Immigration Judge erred in finding the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal. In addition, the respondent appears to assert that the Immigration Judge’s reliance on that evidence violates the respondent’s right to due process. The respondent’s arguments are without merit.
 
On his application for cancellation of removal, the respondent indicated that he had been convicted of a firearms offense for which he received 2 years of probation (Exh. 3 at 5). During the course of the proceedings before the Immigration Judge, the respondent, through counsel, informed the court that the respondent was convicted of the offense of possessing a firearm in violation of Title 18 U.S.C. section 922(g)(5), which is an aggravated felony pursuant to section 101(a)(43)(E)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(E)(ii) (Tr. at 23, 50-53, 55-60).
 
The record contains sufficient evidence to support the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent has been convicted of an aggravated felony and, as a result, is ineligible for cancellation for removal. See section 240(A)(b)(1)(C) of the Act. The Immigration Judge properly relied on the respondent’s admissions concerning his conviction and afforded the respondent every opportunity to meet his burden of proving eligibility for relief from removal. Furthermore, the respondent was represented by counsel and received a full and fair hearing on the merits of his claim before the Immigration Judge.1 Thus, we find no due process violation or prejudice. As the conviction issue is dispositive, we decline to address the issue of whether the respondent has sustained his burden of proving the requisite level of hardship.
 
In addition, the Immigration Judge properly denied voluntary departure finding that, as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony within the proscribed period, the respondent failed to establish the requisite good moral character (I.J. at 8-9). See sections 240B(b)(1)(B), 101(f)(8) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229c(b)(1)(B), 1101(f)(8). On whole, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s resolution.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent also requests a remand asserting that, as the beneficiary of an approved visa petition, he is eligible to adjust his status. Although the respondent has submitted a copy of an approved visa petition, he has not submitted a copy of a properly executed adjustment application and supporting documentation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) (2004); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992). Consequently, the respondent has failed to establish prima facie eligibility for adjustment and, therefore, we decline to remand the case. See Matter of S-V-, 20 I&N Dec. 1306, 1307 (BIA 2000); Matter of Coelho, supra. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed and the motion to remand is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Davis, Howard R.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated May 11, 2004. On June 19, 2003, the respondent submitted both an appeal and a motion to reopen. We failed to address his motion. We dismissed his appeal in an order summarily affirming the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen his removal proceedings conducted in absentia. The respondent now seeks reopening for our consideration of the motion he previously submitted, as well as a new claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. He contends that his former counsel failed to present sufficient evidence and argument which resulted in both the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen and our dismissal of his appeal. The respondent has presented evidence that he has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), but he has not clearly demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel. However, we find that reopening and remand of the record is warranted in this case so that the Immigration Judge may consider the respondent’s evidence that he gave his correct address to the Department of Homeland Security as reflected on the Notice to Appear and on the Form I-213 dated December 5, 2002, but someone who completed his bond papers listed an incorrect address on Form I-830 and caused the notice of the hearing to be misdirected. We will remand the record for the Immigration Judge to consider the respondent’s claim that, being unaware of the error, he had no reason to think that he needed to file a change of address with the court.
 
Accordingly, the motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Natalia Nekrasova, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time. The final order in these proceedings, in which we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying suspension of deportation, was entered by the Board on September 13, 2002. We granted the respondent’s motion seeking adjustment of status, based on marriage to a United States citizen, on May 7, 2003. An Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for adjustment of status on May 30, 2003. On December 16, 2003, we affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge, and determined that we had earlier erred in granting reopening, given that the respondent was ineligible for adjustment of status under Matter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996), for failing to depart under an order of voluntary departure. We denied a motion to reconsider this decision, as untimely filed, on February 25, 2004, and this motion was filed on May 28, 2004. The pending motion was filed late. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be granted.
 
In her motion to reopen, the respondent again seeks to have proceedings reopened in order to pursue an application for adjustment of status, based on marriage to a United States citizen. In Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002), the Board held that a properly filed motion to reopen for adjustment of status based on a marriage entered into after the commencement of proceedings may be granted in the exercise of discretion, notwithstanding the pendency of a visa petition filed on the alien’s behalf, where: (1) the motion to reopen is timely filed; (2) the motion is not numerically barred by the regulations; (3) the motion is not barred by Matter of Shaar, supra, or on any other procedural grounds; (4) clear and convincing evidence is presented indicating a strong likelihood that the marriage is bona fide; and (5) the DHS does not oppose the motion or bases its opposition solely on Matter of Arthur, 20 I&N Dec. 475 (BIA 1992).
 
As noted, we found in our December 16, 2003, decision that reopening is barred by Matter of Shaar, supra. Pursuant to former section 242B(e)(2) of the Act, an alien who fails to depart following a grant of voluntary departure is statutorily barred from applying for certain forms of discretionary relief, including adjustment of status. However, the respondent argues that she was unaware that she had to depart under the Board’s September 13, 2002, order, because former counsel led her to believe that filing a motion to reopen would prevent the respondent from overstaying the voluntary departure period (Respondent’s Mot., at 2-3; Exh. 3; Respondent’s Affidavit).
 
*2 Similarly, the respondent argues that the motions deadline should be tolled, based on former counsel’s assurance that our December 16, 2003, decision would be reconsidered, and counsel’s failure to inform her until March 2004, that such efforts had been unsuccessful and the respondent would have to depart the United States.
 
The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Under the circumstances, we agree that the motions deadline should be excused. See Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182 (9th Cir. 2004)(motions deadline subject to equitable tolling where lawyer’s actions caused late filing, and respondent thereafter acted with due diligence). Accordingly, the record is remanded in order to afford the respondent an opportunity to present her application for adjustment of status to the Immigration Judge.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dwelshauvers, Philippe M., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James R. Knapp,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated January 26, 2004. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not pertinent here), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before April 26, 2004. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until April 28, 2004. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time. We note that even if the motion had been timely filed, reopening would be denied because the new evidence offered by the respondent would not change the result in this case. See Matter of Coehlo, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). This is because the respondent was denied voluntary departure for lack of good moral character based on the length of his incarceration, not the fact of his conviction. See sections 240B(b)(1)(B) and 101(f)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229c(b)(1)(B) and 1101(f)(7);. Insofar as the respondent may seek reopening on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, we note that he has failed to comply in any measure with the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (compliance with Lozada generally required). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jennifer S. Goldmeier,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 4, 2003.1 The record reflects that the respondent, through counsel, conceded proper service of the Notice to Appear (NTA), admitted the allegations in the NTA, conceded removability, waived all forms of relief from removal (Tr. at 21-23) and when asked by the Immigration Judge whether he understood and agreed with the plea, the respondent answered in the affirmative (Tr. at 25). The respondent, through counsel, also waived appeal (Tr. at 28).
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that he was denied a fair hearing due to ineffective assistance of counsel. However, we note that he has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent did not present an affidavit detailing how he was aggrieved by his former counsel. The respondent did not demonstrate that is former counsel was informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond. The respondent did not establish that he filed complaints with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding his former counsel’s ethical or legal violations. Nor did the respondent explain why he has not filed such complaints. Id.; Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Moreover, the respondent has failed to establish how he has been prejudiced. Figeroa v. INS, 886 F.2d 76 (4th Cir. 1989) (“To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at a deportation proceeding, an alien must show not only ineffective representation, but also prejudice to him which occurred as a result of that ineffectiveness”). In this regard, we note that the respondent is removable as one who has been convicted of an aggravated felony (Government Exh. C) and he has failed to specify any relief for which he would be eligible.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sergei Shevchenko, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sumeet Lall
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. A final order of removal was entered against the respondent by an Immigration Judge on March 24, 2003. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal without opinion on January 13, 2004. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on June 23, 2004, claiming that an attorney provided ineffective assistance by not filing a brief with the Board prior to our final order. The pending motion to reopen was filed late. A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed not later than 90 days after the date of that decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
There is no basis for abrogating the motions deadline here. An individual seeking to rely upon “equitable tolling” of a filing deadline must show that he has acted with due diligence. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9 th Cir.2003); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1225 (9th Cir. 2002) (acknowledging that party claiming that equitable tolling applies to reopening deadline must show that he acted with reasonable diligence); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997)(Board will exercise its sua sponte authority over an untimely motion only in an “exceptional situation”). See also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373 (A.G. 2002). Such due diligence is not shown here. Although the respondent claims that he had an agreement with an attorney to file the brief, the respondent appeared pro se before the Board, and our decision was mailed directly to him. The respondent does not say when he consulted with current counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra (in that case, court found that to the extent that equitable tolling applies, based on actions of prior counsel, limitations period begins when respondent meets with new counsel and learns of fraud).
 
In any event, the respondent failed to comply with our procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Siong v. INS, 2004 WL 1637039 (9th Cir. July 23, 2004). Most critically, there is no convincing evidence that the respondent gave the attorney the opportunity to respond to the allegations of ineffectiveness. Id. The respondent claims that he “contacted his former attorney to request a statement regarding his failure to submit brief” (Respondent’s Response, at p. 3). This claim is insufficient to indicate that the attorney was informed of the claims made against him. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598-99 (9th Cir. 2004)(notification to counsel is “required” for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and complaint letter to California State Bar with notation “cc” to opposing counsel does not satisfy the requirement). Consequently, there is no statement or affidavit from counsel, giving his version of events. Id. (citing Matter of Lozada, supra, court said that notice to challenged counsel provides a mechanism by which counsel may respond, giving his version of events, and discouraging baseless allegations).
 
*2 The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Vitalia D. Shafer, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law (all respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This matter was last before the Board on October 31, 2003, at which time we dismissed the respondents’ appeal of the Immigration Judge’s July 29, 2001, decision for failing to timely file a brief or statement in support of the appeal. The respondents have filed a timely motion to reopen on January 29, 2004, alleging ineffective assistance by their former counsel and requesting that this matter be reopened. The Department of Homeland Security (the DHS, formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the motion. The Board will deny the motion.
 
The Board has found that certain criteria must be met in order to grant a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the motion must be supported by an affidavit of the respondents setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make, counsel must be informed of the allegations against him and provided an opportunity to respond, and the motion must reflect whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). The documentary evidence presented by the respondents meets the requirements set forth in Lozada.
 
While the respondents have complied with the established requirements to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this matter arose, has held that, in addition to meeting the procedural requirements, an alien must also show prejudice. Although there is a rebuttable presumption of prejudice where alien’s counsel fails to file an appeal brief, any such presumption of prejudice is rebutted where the alien fails to show that an appeal brief could have changed the outcome of the appeal proceedings before the Board. See Dakane v. United States Attorney General, 371 F.3d 771 (11th Cir. 2004).
 
The Board finds that the respondents’ allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are unpersuasive. While the respondents argue that there was ineffective assistance of counsel because their previous counsel failed to submit properly translated evidence of the risk to the medical profession in Columbia, the respondents do not suggest that the document could have affected the Immigration Judge’s decision, particularly in light of the Immigration Judge’s comprehensive analysis of the objective reports of country conditions. Moreover, the respondents have not indicated what arguments they would have presented on appeal that could have changed the outcome of the appeal proceedings before the Board. Accordingly, as the respondents were not shown to have experienced actual prejudice, either during the course of the proceeding before the Immigration Judge or by the previous counsel’s failure to file an appeal brief, there can be no ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 The respondents’ motion to reopen will be denied.

File: AXX XX4 007 - Los Angeles
August 24, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nassim Arzani, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Tracy Nguyen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
This matter was last before the Board on November 20, 2003, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our August 20, 2002, decision denying his motion to reopen. The respondent has now filed a second motion to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. The motion seeks reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent, a native and citizen of Jordan who is married to a United States citizen, wishes to apply for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255. In the alternative, the respondent requests reinstatement of the voluntary departure period granted by the Immigration Judge at the respondent’s hearing on July 11, 2001. The Department of Homeland Security (the DHS, formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, an alien may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and the motion must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The instant motion, filed on July 9, 2004, represents the respondent’s second attempt to reopen his proceedings. It was not filed within 90 days of the final administrative order. The respondent requests that the filing deadline be equitably tolled because he received ineffective assistance of counsel regarding his appeal before the Board. The respondent states in an affidavit that he never received the Board’s decision regarding his appeal, and therefore did not know that he needed to leave the United States within 30 days of the date of the order, which was issued May 6, 2002, in order to comply with the terms of his voluntary departure. See generally section 240B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c. Rather, the respondent claims that he remained in the United States on the advice of his attorney, applied for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, and was detained by the DHS at his adjustment interview on June 21, 2004.
 
The doctrine of equitable tolling may, in certain circumstances, override the rules regarding motions to reopen in cases where the respondent has been defrauded by an individual purporting to provide legal representation. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1224 (9th Cir. 2002). In order to receive the benefit of equitable tolling, a respondent who alleges ineffective assistance must first comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The motion to reopen should be supported by an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts, including a statement setting forth the details of the agreement that was entered into with former counsel. See id. at 639. The respondent should also notify former counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance so that he or she may respond, and, if the case involved a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities on the part of former counsel, the respondent should file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Id. In this case, the motion is supported by an affidavit from the respondent, a short declaration from the respondent’s former counsel stating that he never received a decision from the Board regarding the respondent’s case, and a complaint form for the State Bar of California that had not yet been submitted when the motion was filed (Respondent’s Exhs. B, C, H). We find that the respondent has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada. See Rodriguez-Lariz, supra, at 1226-27 (stating that the factors are not rigidly applied).
 
*2 We do not, however, find that the evidence of record supports the respondent’s allegation that neither he nor his former attorney received notice of the Board’s decision regarding his appeal. Our order summarily affirming the decision of the Immigration Judge was issued May 6, 2002. The respondent’s former counsel submitted the fast motion to reopen shortly thereafter, on June 3, 2002. The Board denied the motion to reopen on August 20, 2002. The respondent, through former counsel, then filed a motion to reconsider on November 20, 2003. The Board considered the merits of the motion despite its untimeliness. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Finding no factual or legal error in the prior order, the Board denied the motion to reconsider on March 24, 2004. The instant motion asserts that the respondent knew nothing of the Board’s decisions regarding his case. Given the lengthy procedural history above, this assertion simply is not credible. It stands to reason that the attorney received notice of the Board’s decision regarding the respondent’s appeal because he otherwise would not have known to file the motion to reopen. It is also reasonable to assume the attorney consulted with his client regarding the decision, as the motion would have required more work by the attorney for which he presumably would have been compensated. Moreover, the respondent has not sufficiently rebutted the presumption of effective mail service. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). Under section 239(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c), service by mail is sufficient if there is proof of attempted delivery to the last address provided by the alien. We therefore cannot give credence to the respondent’s assertion that he did not know he needed to depart the United States, and we conclude that his case does not merit equitable tolling.
 
We further note that the respondent’s request for remand to the Immigration Judge for consideration of his application for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act is not appropriate because the respondent is an arriving alien; therefore, jurisdiction over the application lies not with the Immigration Judge, but with the DHS. 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(1). We are also unable to grant the respondent’s request to reinstate the voluntary departure period. The Board does not have authority to reinstate voluntary departure in this instance. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.29(h) (requiring removal proceedings to be reopened for purpose other than solely making application for voluntary departure). Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dani Lisa Page
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondents filed a motion to reopen on June 22, 2004. We dismissed the respondents’ appeal on December 9, 2002. The motion has been filed out of time and will be denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion.
 
The respondents claim in their motion that prior counsel, who has been suspended from the Colorado bar, was incompetent, because he failed to file a brief with this Board, which caused us to dismiss the appeal for failure to file a brief. There is, however, no basis for abrogating the motions deadline here.
 
Equitable tolling of the motions deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf. See Riley v. INS, 310 F.3d 1253, 1257-58 (10th Cir. 2002). The pending motion was filed over a year late. The respondents claim that they were unaware of former counsel’s ineffective assistance until they consulted with the attorney who signed the pending motion, but failed to enter his appearance with the Board. Yet the attorney who signed the pending motion began representing the respondents on October 15, 2003, according to a letter he wrote to the Colorado Supreme Court Attorney Regulation Counsel. Even so, this motion was not submitted for 8 more months. As Riley v. INS, supra, at 1258, requires, we have considered that the respondents have complied with the procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). However, the respondents have not shown due diligence in presenting their claims in the pending motion, where the motion was not filed for many months after new counsel was consulted. Riley v. INS, supra, at 1258. The respondents state that they did not become aware of former counsel’s ineffective assistance of counsel until current counsel “received a copy of the administrative record” (Respondents’ Mot., at p. 12). However, the respondents do not state when this occurred. Exhibits submitted with the motion indicate that counsel who signed the pending motion submitted a brief to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals on February 6, 2004, after receiving the administrative record. Id.; Respondent’s Mot. at Exh. 4. The pending motion was not filed for another four months. The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James J. Orlow, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The instant motion is untimely and number-barred and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on November 26, 2002. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not pertinent here), only one motion to reopen may be filed and in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before February 24, 2003. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until April 14, 2004, more than a year late. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time.
 
Counsel for the respondent urges that we reopen proceedings in the exercise of our sua sponte reopening authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). We will not do so. New counsel for the respondent alleges ineffective assistance by prior counsel in failing to point out that the charging document (Order to Show Cause, Form I-221) contained the incorrect ground of deportability. The Form I-221 states that on November 17, 1986, the respondent entered the United States without inspection under section 241(a)(1)(B) of the INA (1995). However, new counsel has pointed out that the respondent on November 17, 1986, entered the United States with an F-1 nonimmigrant student visa, as indicated by the stamp in his passport and the confirmation by official records. Thus, it appears that the proper ground of deportability would have been as a visa overstay, under section 241(a)(1)(C) of the INA (1995). However, counsel has failed to establish that the respondent was not deportable when the Immigration Judge issued the in absentia order of deportation in this case on September 5, 1996.
 
The respondent has failed to meet the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 U&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) in order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Furthermore, he has failed to show prejudice in his case. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62 (BIA 2003). The respondent has failed to show that he was not deportable. The respondent has failed to show that reopening would be warranted in this case. See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000) (alien failed to show substantial likelihood that the result in the case would be changed if proceedings were reopened); see generally Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996). The respondent hired several attorneys over the 17 years he has been in the United States and the 8 years he has been in immigration proceedings, yet he has failed to adjust his status or depart the United States. The respondent has failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing his claims to relief.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Curley, Kathleen M.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 27, 2003. The respondent submitted a timely motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and a claim for relief from removal based on a visa petition filed by his mother and a pending visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife. The Immigration Judge did not render a decision on the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). He found that the visa petition filed by the respondent’s mother was no longer pending, and that reopening was not warranted on that basis. He determined that the respondent failed to demonstrate the bona fides of his marriage to establish that he is eligible for relief based on the pending visa petition filed by his wife. We note that the respondent’s marriage to his United States citizen wife took place 4 years before the initiation of removal proceedings. There is no requirement to demonstrate the bona fides of that marriage to support the visa petition. We will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and his claim of eligibility for relief based on the pending visa petition filed by his wife. Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.

AXX XX5 320
August 23, 2004
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ilyce Shugall, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Larry J. Gallagher
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - Entered without inspection (both respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Suspension of deportation; fair hearing
 
The respondents now appeal from an Immigration Judge’s June 6, 2003, decision denying their requests for suspension of deportation under section 244(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, & U.S.C. § 1254(a), and from the Immigration Judge’s July 2, 2003, decision denying their motion to reconsider that decision. For the reasons set forth in the Immigration Judge’s decisions, we will adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondents’ requests for suspension of deportation. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
On appeal, the respondents reiterate the arguments put forth during the deportation bearings and in the motion to reconsider. It is undisputed, however, that the respondent Serafin Campos-Soria (AXX XXX XXX) entered the United States on September 1, 1992, and was served with an Order to Show Cause on June 14, 1994. It is further undisputed that the respondent Rosa Cuamba Rodriguez (AXX XXX XXX) entered the United States on October 1, 1992, and was served with an Order to Show Cause May 14, 1994. We find, therefore, that the Immigration Judge correctly concluded that the respondents are ineligible for relief under section 244(a) of the Act because they failed to establish that they had been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 7 years immediately preceding the issuance of the Orders to Show Cause. See section 244(a)(1) of the Act. See also Matter of Nolasco, 22 I&N Dec. 632, 641 (BIA 1999) (discussing the application of the “stop-time” rule under section 309(c)(5) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, the “IIRIRA”). We emphasize that the Immigration Judge appropriately applied the law as it existed on the hearing date, and rendered the correct decision. Compare, Guadalupe-Cruz v. INS, 240 F.3d 1209, opinion corrected by 250 F.3d 1271 (9th Cir. 2001). In addition, if the respondents had succeeded in advancing this hearing to a date prior to April 1, 1997, they would not have accrued the necessary continuous physical presence by that date.
 
*2 While their appeal remained pending before the Board, the respondent filed a motion to remand based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. They specifically allege that their former attorney failed to act with due diligence to proceed with the hearings prior to the April 1, 1997, effective date for section 309 of the IIRIRA, thus precluding their eligibility for suspension of deportation. Although we find that the respondents have complied with the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), we cannot find that they suffered prejudice as a result of the attorney’s conduct. Even if the attorney had filed the applications for suspension of deportation on behalf of the respondents prior April 1, 1997, the respondents would not have accrued the requisite 7 years of continuous physical presence required under section 244(a)(1) of the Act at that time. See, generally, Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); cf. Guadalupe-Cruz v. INS, 240 F.3d 1209 (9th Cir. 2001). We will deny the motion.
 
In sum, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s findings and conclusion, and we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision. Inasmuch as the dispositive facts of this case are undisputed, and the respondents suffered no prejudice as a result of their former attorney’s handling of the case, we reject the respondent’s contentions with regard to the fairness of the proceedings. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and in accordance with our decision in Matter of Chouliaris, 16 I&N Dec. 168 (BIA 1977), the respondents are permitted to depart from the United States voluntarily within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director; and in the event of failure so to depart, the respondents shall be deported as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.

File: AXX XX3 367 - Newark
August 20, 2004
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alexander J. Segal, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals from a May 14, 2004, decision by the Immigration Judge to deny his motion to reopen his deportation proceedings. The motion was denied as untimely. The respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance from his former counsel, who failed to file an appeal with this Board after the respondent was ordered deported, and that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the motion was untimely. A motion to reopen before an Immigration Judge must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order of removal, deportation, or exclusion, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). The respondent was ordered deported on November 29, 1996, but did not file a motion to reopen until April 23, 2004, after being detained by the Department of Homeland Security (the DHS, formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service). Moreover, the respondent’s motion did not conform with the requirements under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Such motions must be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent attesting to the relevant facts, including a statement setting forth the details of the agreement that was entered into with former counsel. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. The respondent should also notify former counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance so that he or she may respond, and, if the case involved a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities on the part of former counsel, the respondent should file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, Id. In this case, the motion to reopen submitted to the Immigration Judge included only an affidavit by the respondent and correspondence from the respondent’s former attorney regarding his appeal, which is insufficient. We note that on appeal the respondent has attached new evidence that he filed a complaint with the Departmental Disciplinary Committee in New York and sent correspondence of some kind to his former attorney; however, it appears that the mailings occurred after the Immigration Judge ruled on the respondent’s motion (Respondent’s Exhs. A-C). We note that the Board does not consider new evidence on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
*2 Finally, we conclude that the respondent is not eligible for equitable tolling. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the circuit in which in this matter arises, has not addressed the issue of whether the filing deadline for a motion to reopen may be equitably tolled. The respondent correctly notes that other circuit courts of appeals have applied the doctrine of equitable tolling to the regulatory time limitation for motions to reopen and have treated actions by the agent of a party as the proper subject of equitable tolling in favor of that same party. See, e.g., Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000). In order to receive the benefit of equitable tolling, however, an alien must demonstrate not only that his constitutional right to due process was violated by the conduct of counsel, but also that he has exercised due diligence during the period he wishes to toll. See Iavorski v. INS, supra, at 135. While we understand that the respondent’s former counsel allegedly failed to file a Notice of Appeal with the Board after the respondent was ordered deported in 1996, the respondent has not adequately explained why he waited over 7 years to file his motion to reopen. Because the respondent has failed to demonstrate due diligence in pursuing his claim, we do not find that his case warrants equitable tolling. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Richard VanVeldhuisen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondents1 filed a motion to reopen on April 23, 2004. We dismissed the respondents’ appeal on March 21, 2003. The motion has been filed out of time. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondents claim in their motion that prior counsel was incompetent, because prior counsel failed to inform them of the Board’s prior decision so they could file a timely motion to reopen. There is, however, no basis for abrogating the motions deadline here. Any equitable tolling of the motions deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 127, 134-35. (2nd Cir. 2000). The pending motion was filed almost a year late. The respondents do not say when they learned of the Board’s prior order, and therefore fail to establish that the motion could not have been filed earlier.
 
In any event, for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108, 110 (2d Cir. 1993). The respondents have not satisfied these requirements. The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

The pending motion was filed by a family. We note that Nubyra Zahid Chowdhury, A 73 566 600, was included in the motion. However, she is represented by counsel and filed an earlier, separate motion to reopen, which will be addressed in a separate order. To the extent that Nubyra Zahid Chowdhury, A 73 566 600, wishes to be included in this order, this motion as to her would be numerically barred as well as untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Juan A. Laguna, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (both respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondents move the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated November 24, 2003. The respondents request that we apply the principle of equitable tolling and consider their motion despite the fact that it was filed more than 90 days after our final removal order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999) (concluding that the statute of limitations for reopening order of deportation should be tolled when alien has been the victim of fraud). Even assuming that the motion was timely under the doctrine of equitable tolling, the respondents have failed to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), wherein we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The respondent has not contacted former counsel, informed him of the allegations leveled against him, and given him an opportunity to respond. In Matter of Lozada, at 639, we stated that “before allegations of ineffectiveness are presented to the Board, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond. Any subsequent response from counsel, or report of counsel’s failure or refusal to respond should be submitted with the motion” (emphasis added). We noted that the high standard which we enunciated was necessary if the Board is to have a basis for assessing the substantial number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that come before us. Id. It is crucial that former counsel be given “the opportunity to respond to the allegation¿sº of ineffectiveness,” due to the charges made by the respondent. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598-99 (9th Cir. 2004)(notification to counsel is “required” for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and complaint letter to California State Bar with notation “cc” to opposing counsel does not satisfy the requirement). For example, in the male respondent’s affidavit he writes that he indicated to the immigration consultant that his son Omar was under medical supervision because of renal problems, but his son’s condition was never addressed during the hearing. The respondent maintains that he emphasized this fact on several occasions. However, when the male respondent testified during the removal hearing he indicated that Omar was in good health (Tr. at 15). While the respondents have raised this issue in their ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we have no statement or affidavit from counsel, giving his version of events and thus no way to assess the validity of the claim. See also Ponce-Leiva v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 3369 (3rd Cir. 2003) (A requirement of Lozada includes filing a motion and giving the allegedly ineffective counsel an opportunity to respond). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated that rigid adherence to the Lozada requirements is not always required, see Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir.2002) (Lozada “factors are not rigidly applied, especially when the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance”). However, in this case the need for notification and response from former counsel is critical to our meaningful assessment of this claim. Reyes v. Ashcroft, supra. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

File: AXX XX0 244 - San Francisco

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Martin Resendez Guajardo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Katherine Zill
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On June 9, 2004, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider the Board’s May 10, 2004, decision finding that he had waived his right to appeal. The respondent contends that this Board erroneously found that he had made no argument on appeal that his waiver of appeal was not knowing and intelligent as he raised this specific argument in his Notice of Appeal. The respondent also contends that he was deprived of the right to file a brief on appeal as he was not provided with a transcript of the proceedings. Furthermore, the respondent avers that the Immigration Judge erred in not informing him that he might be eligible for relief in the form of asylum (Motion at 4-5).
 
When deciding a motion to reconsider, the Board considers the case as though the decision in the case on the record before us had never been entered. If the applicant was eligible for relief at the time of the original decision, then in reconsidering the decision, we treat his status as that which it had been at the time of the initial decision. “The very nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard.” Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991).
 
The respondent correctly notes that the Board erred in stating that he had not contended that his waiver was not knowing and intelligent. However, the Board correctly noted that the respondent was represented by counsel when he elected to waive appeal, contrary to his contentions otherwise (Tr. at 5). We find no merit to the respondent’s argument that he had not retained the attorney and that the record does not indicate whether she had been “fully familiar” with his case (Reply to DHS Opposition). When he waived appeal, the respondent appeared with the same counsel who had represented him at the prior hearing. The fact that the respondent contracted for services with another attorney who then utilized the representative who ultimately appeared on his behalf is not relevant to our inquiry. It is the respondent’s prerogative whom he chooses to serve as his representative, if any. The representative at issue submitted a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney on behalf of the respondent, which the respondent never contested, and appeared twice on his behalf (Tr. at 1, 5). At no time during the proceedings below did the respondent indicate that this woman was not his representative. As such, the record corroborates the Board’s finding that the respondent appeared with counsel, through whom he waived appeal (Tr. at 5-6). Given these facts, the Board did not err in finding that the respondent had waived appeal. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320 (BIA 2000). Moreover, while the respondent suggests that his counsel was not adequately prepared, he has not complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637(BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 We find no merit to the respondent’s argument that he was “denied” the right to file a brief because he was not provided with a transcript of the proceedings (Motion at 3). The Board does not normally prepare a transcript when a party has waived appeal as the Immigration Judge’s decision is final. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(a)(1); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). While the respondent also asserts error in that he was not afforded an interpreter, we note that he informed the Immigration Judge that he speaks English (Tr. at 2). Moreover, the respondent’s counsel indicated that she had conferred with him before waiving appeal on his behalf (Tr. at 5). Again, if the respondent seeks to assert that his counsel took action contrary to their agreement or that she, in fact, had not adequately conferred with him, he has not met the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, supra. Finally, we find no merit to the respondent’s allegation that the Immigration Judge erred in not noting that as a particular political party was no longer in power that “there was an inference that ¿the respondentº may fear returning” to his native Pakistan (Motion at 5). This argument is highly attenuated. An Immigration Judge is under no obligation to present a respondent’s claim on his behalf, particularly where, as here, a respondent is represented. The respondent through counsel informed the Immigration Judge that he was not seeking any relief, and he wished to have an order entered for his return to Pakistan (Tr. at 5). As such, there was no “inference” that could be drawn that the respondent feared harm if removed from the United States. In sum, we find no basis upon which reopening is warranted.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM: The appeal is dismissed. The summary of the Immigration Judge’s oral decision, dated October 28, 2003, noted that the Immigration Judge granted the respondent 4 months voluntary departure. We also note that in the transcript of proceedings, the respondent, represented by counsel, agreed to 4 month period of voluntary departure. One of the regulatory conditions for being granted 120 days voluntary departure in removal proceedings is that the alien “waives appeal of all issues ….” 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D). On November 24, 2003, the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26). Upon review, we find that this case is not properly before us. The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). The respondent has argued that the decision to waive appeal was not a knowing and intelligent one, because, although his attorney discussed it with him, he did not understand it. Absent valid assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel, per Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we are forced to conclude that the respondent, having selected his attorney, is bound by his attorney’s actions, especially where he has discussed them with the respondent. Accordingly, as there is nothing now pending before the Board,
 
IT IS ORDERED that the record be returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gary Silbiger, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(l)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent is an unmarried male native and citizen of Lebanon. In a decision dated March 30, 1999, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), and granted him the privilege of voluntary departure. The respondent filed a timely appeal. The Board summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision on September 24, 2002, and granted the respondent 30 days in which to voluntarily depart. The respondent filed a petition for review of that decision with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On March 17, 2004, the Ninth Circuit dismissed his petition for review of the Board’s September 24, 2002, dismissal of his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision. A petition for rehearing was denied by the Ninth Circuit on July 12, 2004.
 
While the respondent’s petition for review was pending, he filed, on December 23, 2002, a timely motion to reopen based upon counsel’s assertion that the respondent was gathering additional evidence regarding the exceptional and extremely unusual requirement for his previously denied cancellation of removal application. The Board denied the motion on July 30, 2003, for failure to support the motion with an affidavit or other evidentiary material as required by regulation.
 
On August 29, 2003, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen and reconsider in which he alleged that he had additional new and material evidence regarding his eligibility for cancellation of removal. On October 27, 2003, the Board denied the motion to reconsider for failure to allege any factual or legal error in the Board’s prior decision as required for reconsideration and denied the motion to reopen for again failing to support the motion with evidence as required by regulation and also for exceeding the numerical limitations for motions to reopen as dictated by regulation.
 
On August 9, 2004, the respondent filed his third motion to reopen in which he seeks to have an opportunity to apply for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255, based upon an approved visa petition filed on his behalf by his United States citizen mother and to again apply for cancellation of removal based upon his claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from Barry Fagan, the attorney who represented him at his removal hearing.1 On August 11, 2004, the respondent filed a supplement to his motion to reopen in which he raised arguments regarding his voluntary departure period and the tolling of motions to reopen based upon claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. On August 12, 2004, the respondent filed, via facsimile transmission, a second supplement to his motion to reopen in which he provided his application for adjustment of status — one of the forms of relief sought in his August 9, 2004, motion — as well as an addendum and a supplement to that application. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed no response to the respondent’s three filings regarding his most recent motion to reopen. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
*2 We first address that portion of the respondent’s motion that deals with his request for reopening so that he can apply for adjustment of status. In order to have proceedings reopened so that he can apply for adjustment of status, the respondent must show that the motion is timely filed, he has a visa immediately available to him, that he is not statutorily barred for failing to voluntarily depart within 30 days of the Board’s September 24, 2002, decision, and that he is not otherwise barred or ineligible for adjustment of status. The respondent currently has a visa immediately available to him due to his mother’s naturalization on January 30, 2004, and the resulting conversion of his second preference visa to a first preference visa.2 See Dep’t. of State Visa Bulletin, Vol. VIII, No. 72 (Aug. 2004). The respondent contends that his voluntary departure period, as calculated under Ninth Circuit law, expires on August 18, 2004.3 Under Ninth Circuit law, the respondent is thus not statutorily barred by section 240(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), from having proceedings reopened where he did not depart the United States within 30 days of the Board’s September 24, 2002, order.
 
However, the respondent is barred by the time and numerical limitations in the motions regulation from having proceedings reopened because he is seeking reopening in order to apply for adjustment of status in his third motion to reopen which was filed well after the expiration of the 90-day period for the timely filing of motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s motion, as it relates to his request for adjustment of status, does not fall within any of the exceptions to the time and numerical bars for motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). The respondent states that the motion should be granted, even though it is untimely and his third motion, because he is now eligible for adjustment of status and is claiming that he received ineffective assistance from his former counsel. As the respondent did not become eligible to apply for adjustment of status until his mother became a naturalized United States citizen on January 30, 2004, he cannot claim that any alleged ineffectiveness of the attorney who represented him only at his removal hearings, which ended on March 30, 1999, affected his ability to timely file a motion to reopen for adjustment of status within 90 days of the Board’s September 24, 2002, decision. Moreover, it is present counsel’s filing of two previous, and clearly defective, motions to reopen that subjects the respondent to the numerical bars regarding the instant motion to reopen. The respondent does not cite to any exception to the time and numerical limitations on motions to reopen which are based upon eligibility for adjustment of status and we find none in the regulations. Thus, the respondent’s motion to reopen for adjustment of status must be denied.
 
*3 We next turn to that portion of the respondent’s motion that seeks reopening so that he can again apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act. The respondent contends that he has new evidence showing that he met the continuous physical presence requirement and cites to a variety of documents which he provides as exhibits D-G with his motion. The respondent, however, fails to explain how his 1983-1984 high school records, college records for 1986-1988, bank letter attesting to an account opened in October of 1987 to the October 16, 1997, date of the letter, and social security records showing employment earnings for 1985-1986 and 1989-2002, constitutes new or previously unavailable or undiscoverable evidence that could not have been presented at his March 30, 1999, hearing. Nor has the respondent demonstrated how this evidence could not have been presented with either of his first two motions to reopen. The respondent also asserts that he has new evidence that his mother would face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if he is deported. He points to the death of his father, his mother’s subsequent diagnosis of depression, and her continued health problems for which she needs assistance. Counsel’s statements that the respondent’s brother and sister cannot provide their mother with the emotional and economic assistance that is provided by the respondent is insufficient to show that proceedings should be reopened on this basis. Furthermore, the respondent does not explain why his mother, a United States citizen, cannot obtain local, state, or federal assistance for the elderly or disabled or why such aid could not be used in conjunction with any aid provided by the respondent’s brother, who lives with the respondent and their mother, and by the respondent’s sister, who lives within 1 hour of their mother.
 
The crux of the respondent’s present motion is his allegation that he received ineffective assistance from his former attorney and thus should have proceedings reopened. The respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance from his former counsel in that former counsel did not meet with him sufficiently to be aware of the relevant facts of the case, did not obtain the documentation needed to meet the eligibility requirements for cancellation of removal, did not interview and present crucial witnesses, and did not request an interpreter for the respondent’s lawful permanent resident father, who attempted to testify on his son’s behalf at the hearing. He asserts that his former counsel’s actions fell well below the standard of competency.
 
The respondent has not fully complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), as there is no copy of any agreement regarding his representation by former counsel and it is unclear from the document submitted by the respondent whether he filed a complaint with a state bar, and if so, which state bar. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The “complaint,” which he submitted as exhibit Q to his motion, consists of 1-page of an apparently multi-page document which is unaccompanied by any attachments showing to which state bar the complaint was made. Nor does the respondent provide any evidence showing that the “complaint” was filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. In addition, the letter from present counsel informing former counsel of the complaint lodged against him is dated August 4, 2004, only 4 days before the motion was sent to the Board by overnight courier. See Resp. Mot. at Exh. S. Thus, former counsel was not given a meaningful opportunity to respond to the complaint.4 Without former counsel’s statement as to how he prepared for the respondent’s hearing or how often he met with the respondent, we have an incomplete and one-sided version of the events that transpired. Moreover, the respondent fails to explain why he waited until less than 2 weeks before his voluntary departure date to file the instant motions and supplements thus depriving former counsel and the DHS from having a meaningful opportunity to respond to his numerous arguments.
 
*4 Furthermore, even if we were to find that the respondent has met this first hurdle of establishing substantial compliance with Lozada, we do not find that the respondent’s situation falls within the Ninth Circuit’s equitable tolling policy for aliens who have filed with the Board otherwise untimely motions in which they raise allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001). The Ninth Circuit has stated that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d at 897. See also Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, supra, and cases cited therein. The facts of this case show that all of the alleged ineffectiveness of former counsel could have, and should have, been known prior to the issuance of the Board’s decision on September 24, 2002. Present counsel has been representing the respondent since the filing of the Notice of Appeal on April 27, 1999. Thus, present counsel received a copy of the Immigration Judge’s decision and the transcript of proceedings. The respondent and present counsel were therefore well aware of what evidence was, and was not, submitted to the Immigration Judge as well as what witnesses were, and were not, available to testify on the respondent’s behalf. Even applying equitable tolling to his case, the clock began running at the latest on September 24, 2002, when the Board dismissed his appeal. However, the respondent did not file this motion to reopen until August 9, 2004, almost 2 years after our decision dismissing his appeal and almost 5 months after the Ninth Circuit denied his petition for review of that dismissal. Counsel chose to limit his arguments on appeal to the Board on the Immigration Judge’s alleged failure to order an interpreter and on the Immigration Judge’s alleged error in finding that the respondent’s evidence was insufficient to meet the continuous physical presence and exceptional and extremely unusual hardship requirements. This was a tactical decision by counsel who then chose to wait until the respondent’s request for rehearing on the denial of his petition for review was denied by the Ninth Circuit before filing the instant motion to reopen. The respondent could have filed a timely motion to remand during the pendency of his appeal or a timely motion to reopen setting forth the facts of his case but did not do so. We do not find that the respondent acted diligently in this case.
 
Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Footnotes

The respondent has been represented by present counsel since the filing of his Notice of Appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 30, 1999, decision.

2

The respondent’s approved visa petition, with a priority date of April 3, 1996, was filed on his behalf by his mother who was, at the time of the filing of the petition, a lawful permanent resident. The respondent’s mother became a naturalized United States citizen on January 30, 2004. Her naturalization automatically converted his approved petition from a second preference (2B) family petition to a first preference family petition. The respondent would not be eligible for a second preference (2B) visa at this time because visas are available only for petitions with priority dates of July 1, 1995, or early. See Dep’t. of State Visa Bulletin, Vol. VIII, No. 72 (Aug. 2004).

We assume for purposes of this decision that the respondent’s calculation of an August 18, 2004, departure date is correct but have not evaluated the merits of that argument.

4

We also note that the DHS has 13 days in which to respond to the respondent’s motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The respondent’s actions in filing two separate supplements to his motion on August 11th and 12th, when coupled with his request that we issue a decision prior to the August 18, 2004, expiration of his voluntary departure period, ensures that the DHS cannot have the full 13-day period to respond to the motion and its supplements.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio Z. Sandoval, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Monica M. Little
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; remand
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s June 16, 2003, decision pretermitting his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), on grounds of abandonment. During the pendency of the appeal, moreover, the respondent filed a motion to remand in which he asserts that his failure to file his cancellation of removal application was due to the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
It is not disputed that the respondent failed to file his application for cancellation of removal by the deadline set by the Immigration Judge, nor is there any doubt as to whether the respondent was given adequate notice of that deadline. The Immigration Judge has explicit regulatory authority to set a deadline for the filing of applications for relief, and an applicant’s failure to abide by that deadline constitutes an abandonment of the application. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (2003). Because the respondent received ample notice of the filing deadline and was given sufficient time to complete his application, we agree with the Immigration Judge that he did not show good cause for a continuance. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6. Therefore, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
In his motion to remand, the respondent contends that his former attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to timely file his application for cancellation of removal. However, the respondent’s motion does not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and fails to persuade us that his failure to file the application in a timely manner was due to former counsel’s ineffectiveness. Among other things, Matter of Lozada requires that an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel submit an affidavit specifying the nature and scope of former counsel’s representation and either file a complaint against the allegedly-ineffective attorney or provide an adequate explanation for failing to file such a complaint. In this instance the respondent has submitted a sworn declaration in which he states that the precise scope of former counsel’s representation was “never clear” to him and that he was not filing a bar complaint against his former attorney because “¿iºt was not clearly define ¿sicº if ¿former counselº was going to work on the merits of the Immigration matter…” (R’s Motion to Remand, Exh. C). For the reasons stated in Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996), we find the respondent’s explanation for his failure to file a bar complaint against former counsel to be inadequate. Unanswered questions remain regarding the nature of the attorney-client relationship, and the respondent’s failure to file a bar complaint both aggravates these questions and leaves open the possibility of collusion between the respondent and former counsel. Absent the respondent’s full compliance with the Lozada requirements, the degree of confidence we have in his ineffective assistance of counsel claim is lessened to the point where we decline to grant the motion.
 
*2 Furthermore, the respondent is ultimately responsible to be his own advocate in removal proceedings, and if he was in doubt as to whether former counsel’s representation extended to the handling of his immigration case (which would include the filing of his cancellation of removal application), then he was under an obligation either to obtain clarification on that matter prior to his filing deadlines or to file the application himself as an act of prudence. Instead, he simply let matters rest and allowed his deadlines to pass without action. Thus, the respondent’s failure to file the application in a timely manner was necessarily caused at least as much by his own lack of diligence as by former counsel’s ineffective assistance.
 
The following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to so depart, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on October 9, 2003, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his deportation proceedings for lack of jurisdiction. The respondent has now filed another motion to reopen and to terminate the proceedings, again contending that a new charging instrument should be issued, as well as alleging that he is eligible for adjustment of status based on an approved immediate relative visa petition filed on his behalf by his United States citizen spouse. The respondent’s motion is dismissed, as moot.
 
The record reflects the respondent departed the United States to Canada, and was detained and arrested by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) upon his attempted re-entry to the United States. By voluntarily departing the United States to Canada in June 2002, the respondent executed the Immigration Judge’s outstanding order of deportation. Further, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) specifically prohibits our consideration of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider, after the respondent departs from the United States. Consequently, in rendering our October 9, 2003, decision, the Board concluded we had no jurisdiction to consider his request and denied the respondent’s motion, as moot. See Matter of Okoh, 20 I&N Dec. 864 (BIA 1994) (the Board has no jurisdiction over an alien’s motion to reconsider an order of deportation after the order has been executed, and the alien has been deported from the United States.)
 
We decline to revisit issues that were raised, addressed, and resolved in our previous order. Furthermore, as noted by counsel, several motions alleging the ineffective assistance of counsel have been filed, considered, and denied, in this case. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 851 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (setting out the requirements that would support a motion to reopen based on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel). Moreover, as urged by the DHS in its opposition to the respondent’s motion, ineffective assistance of counsel is not the proximate cause for the respondent’s inability to have his case reopened. It is the respondent’s departure from the United States that renders the respondent ineligible for reopening. The respondent cannot excuse the execution of his order of deportation on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Pursuant to section 241(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5), an alien who attempts to illegally re-enter the United States after having voluntarily left the United States, thereby executing the Immigration Judge’s outstanding order of deportation, is subject to the reinstatement of the prior order of deportation, which is not subject to being reopened or reviewed, and may not apply for any relief under the Act, and shall be removed under the prior order.
 
*2 The United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has reached the same conclusion that executed orders of deportation underlying a reinstatement order are not subject to review. In Ojeda-Terrazas v. Ashcroft, 290 F.3d 292, 295 (5th Cir. 2002), the Court found that “section 241(a)(5) ¿of the Actº limits that review to the reinstatement order itself; ¿and that theº court cannot ‘reopen or review’ the merits of the ¿underlyingº deportation order.”
 
Therefore, we are without jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s motion. Accordingly, the record shall be returned to the Immigration Judge without further action.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Judge without further action.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kevin Armstrong,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). We find that the respondent has failed to establish his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as he has neither shown he was prejudiced by establishing that he is eligible for relief nor complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We are without authority to review the decision of the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) to institute removal proceedings and proceed with the hearing which the respondent claims resulted in a violation of his right to the equal protection under the laws. See Matter of U-M-, 20 I&N Dec. 327, 333 (BIA 1991). Finally, we will reinstate the respondent’s voluntary departure order despite the request by the DHS to vacate the order, as it appears to us that the respondent, having posted the required bond, intends to comply with the voluntary departure order. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the alien is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the alien fails to so depart, the alien shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the alien fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the alien shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN RE: NUNES, RICARDO EMANUEL
File: AXX XX0 764 - Newark
August 9, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen and reconsider our decision dated May 13, 2004. Applicable regulations provide that motions to reopen removal proceedings “shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.…” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. The respondent must make a prima facie showing that he is eligible as a matter of law for the relief sought upon reopening. Matter of Rodriguez-Vera, 17 & N Dec. 105 (BIA 1979). A motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration, be supported by pertinent case precedent and be predicated on a legal or factual defect in the most recent decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991).
 
The respondent’s instant motion is based on (1) our failure to grant his timely-filed motion for an extension in the briefing schedule on his appeal, and (2) a claim that ineffective assistance of counsel in the underlying criminal proceedings led to the imposition of a one-year sentence on a probation violation, and, hence, the respondent’s designation as an aggravated felon under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act. At bottom, we assume that the respondent claims that absent the 1-year sentence, he would not have been designated an aggravated felon, that the removal charge would not have been sustained, and that proceedings would have been terminated. As to the first basis for the motion to reopen, the respondent has not made a prima facie showing that he would likely have been granted relief if we had considered his brief on appeal. The respondent has not submitted a copy of the brief or indicated what additional information the appeal brief would have contained beyond the 6-page “Affirmation in Support of the Notice of Appeal” submitted with the appeal on February 11, 2004, which basically raised the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Notably, the respondent has not indicated that the brief would have included the necessary elements to make a cognizable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under rules previously articulated by this Board. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (requiring that the motion be supported by an affidavit by the alien setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel, including relevant representations; that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond: and that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not). The respondent failed to meet these threshold requirements both in the underlying appeal and in his instant motion. At a minimum, we note that even at this point in these proceedings, the respondent has not submitted an affidavit swearing that his counsel in the criminal proceedings failed to inform him of the immigration consequences of his plea to one of the numerous alleged probation violations. Therefore, even if we were to reopen proceedings, the ineffective assistance of counsel claim would be deficient. In this regard, we reject the respondent’s reliance, in the motion to reopen, on his pending motion in New York state court to set aside his one-year criminal sentence. A pending motion to reduce an underlying criminal sentence falls far short of showing clear evidence of prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel during the removal proceedings below. See Ponce-Leiva v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 369, 377 (3d Cir. 2003).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated May 24, 2004. This case was last before us on May 24, 2004, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s January 2, 2003, decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion is denied. The respondent’s motion is vague and lacking in detail. She asserts that her case was prejudiced by the behavior of an unnamed attorney, presumably, Terrence McGuire, who represented her before the Immigration Judge. The respondent has failed to comply with any of the requirements we set forth in See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Nor has the respondent established that her case was prejudiced by the conduct of her prior attorney. See generally Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 561 (BIA 2003). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN RE: LINDA G. MCCALL, BENEFICIARY OF A VISA PETITION FILED BY WILLIAM H. LONG, PETITIONER
File: AXX XX1 767 - California Service Center
August 6, 2004
 
IN VISA PETITION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert Raymond,
Associate Legal Advisor
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal is dismissed. The Regional Service Center (RSC) director instructed the petitioner to submit additional evidence in support of the visa petition, detailing the forms of evidence which might be acceptable. The RSC director correctly determined that the petitioner had failed to adequately respond to the request for additional evidence and had consequently failed to establish the claimed relationship between himself and the beneficiary.
 
Specifically, the petitioner failed to provide evidence that his marriage to the beneficiary was registered and/or recorded after the marriage ceremony. See 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(2).
 
On appeal, the respondent apparently alleges ineffective assistance by former counsel. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel require compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In that case, we held that such claims require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned is informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where this case arises, has found the application of the noted requirements to generally be reasonable, but has held that “they need not be rigidly enforced where their purpose is fully served by other means.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). Here, however, the respondent has failed to even minimally fulfill any of the above-noted requirements. See Rodriguez-Laris v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002)(substantial compliance with Lozada requirements found adequate). As such, the respondent has failed to show that remand on this basis is warranted.
 
The petitioner may, of course, file a new visa petition on the beneficiary’s behalf that is supported by competent evidence that the beneficiary is entitled to the status sought under the immigration laws.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Angleton, James C., Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated January 2l, 2004. The respondent’s motion is based upon a claim of ineffectiveassistanceofcounsel. We find that the respondent has largely complied with the procedural requirements for reopening set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). However, we do not find that the respondent has established that he suffered actual prejudice as a result of his attorney’s allegedly ineffective representation. Id. at 640;Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Even if the facts alleged by the respondent are accepted as true, we do not find that the respondent met his burden of establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of one of the statutorily protected grounds, or that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted or subjected to torture upon his return to Albania. See section 101(a)(42)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478 (1992); INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421 (1987); INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407 (1984); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2); Matter of Y-L-, A-G-, & R-S-R, 23 I&N Dec. 270 (A.G. 2002); Matter of S-V-, 22 I&N Dec. 1306 (BIA 2000). Therefore, we are not persuaded that the respondent would have prevailed on appeal but for former counsel’s allegedly negligent representation. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992)(the party that seeks to reopen bears the “heavy burden” of proving that the result in the case would likely change if proceedings were reopened). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on March 23, 2004, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion is denied.
 
The respondent did not show that she received ineffective assistance of counsel from either of her prior attorneys. First, the respondent did not fully comply with the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Although the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. within whose jurisdiction this matter arises, has held that the Lozada requirements are “not sacrosanct,” the Ninth Circuit has also held that “the Lozada requirements are generally reasonable, and under ordinary circumstances the BIA does not abuse its discretion when it denies a motion to remand or reopen based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel where the petitioner fails to meet the requirements of Lozada..” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
Here, the respondent submitted a complaint to the State Bar of California and an affidavit regarding each attorney from whom she claims she received ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the respondent’s affidavits do not describe “‘in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken … and what counsel did or did not represent to the respondent in this regard.” Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. Rather, the respondent describes very generally her agreement with each attorney. With regard to her first attorney, the respondent could not recall whether she hired him before or after the date that the first Notice of Hearing was mailed to the respondent. In addition, the respondent did not submit evidence that she informed either of her prior attorneys of the accusations leveled against them, much less the provision of an opportunity to respond to those accusations. See id.
 
In the absence of an explanation of the representation agreements between the respondent and her prior attorneys, we cannot determine whether the attorneys failed in their duties to the respondent. In this regard, we note that this case does not involve “a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel” so as to excuse the respondent from satisfying the formal requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. Castillo-Perez, supra, at 525-26. We therefore find that the respondent failed to show that she received ineffective assistance from either of her prior attorneys. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro Se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dani Lisa Page
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2) (1988)º - Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The case was last before the Board on January 14, 1991, when we continued the case indefinitely to allow the respondent an opportunity to pursue temporary protected status. The Department of Homeland Security (“the DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has submitted a motion requesting that the case be reinstated and the respondent’s appeal adjudicated. The DHS’ motion will be granted and the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
In our decision, dated January 14, 1991, we notified both parties that if they wished further action on the matter, they needed to submit a written request to reinstate proceedings accompanied by certification of service on the opposing party. The DHS has submitted a written request to reinstate proceedings along with certification of service on the respondent. As such, the DHS has complied with our decision dated January 14, 1991, and we will grant the DHS’ motion to reinstate proceedings. As a result, we will now adjudicate the respondent’s appeal.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that he was advised not to attend his hearing by counsel. Thus, the respondent’s argument will be construed as an ineffective assistance of counsel argument. However, the record reflects that the respondent was not represented by counsel at the time of his immigration hearing on March 18, 1988. In fact, a Form G-28 (Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative) was not filed with the Immigration Court until December 9, 1988. Moreover, the respondent has not established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Thus, the respondent’s appeal is without merit.
 
ORDER: The DHS’ motion to reinstate proceedings is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXX XX6 660 - Baltimore

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steve Kreiss, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on April 29, 2004. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on November 20, 2002. We denied a motion to reopen as untimely on May 30, 2003. We reconsidered this order on January 30, 2004, then again denied the motion to reopen on the merits. The pending motion to reopen was filed more than 90 days after our final order of November 20, 2002. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, the motion exceeds the numerical limitations for motions to reopen. Id. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied. Although the respondent makes claims against former counsel, who has been suspended from practice before the Board, he does not claim that prior counsel failed to promptly notify him as to the Board’s January 30, 2004, decision. Given that any motion filed after that point would have been late, the respondent fails to explain adequately why he was not able to submit the pending motion until April 29, 2004. This is particularly so given that the respondent has failed to comply with the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Most significantly, the respondent has not provided former counsel with a chance to respond to the charges. The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

IN RE: TCHAKOUNTE, EBENEZER
File: AXX XX9 504 - Baltimore
August 4, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patrick Tzeuton, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on June 9, 2004, when we adopted and affirmed the results of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 1, 2003. On July 7, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen for adjustment of status. The motion is denied.
 
The regulations provide that motions to reopen removal proceedings “shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing ….” 8 C.F.R. § 3.2. This Board has held that a party who seeks to reopen proceedings to pursue a discretionary grant of relief from deportation bears a “heavy burden” of demonstrating that if his motion to reopen were granted, the new evidence presented would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). We find the respondent’s motion must be denied for failure to submit evidence which is material and was not available or could not have been discovered or presented at the respondent’s former hearing. The respondent contends the documents were available to his former counsel but were inadvertently not submitted by his former counsel. However, the respondent’s contentions concerning his former counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance are not substantiated by an affidavit or other evidentiary material. Statements made in a motion are not evidence and are thus not entitled to any evidentiary weight. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980).
 
Moreover, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), which requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Accordingly, the motion is denied

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ronald Finch, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge for the reasons stated therein. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondents raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on appeal. The respondents have failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (B1A 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), which requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002)(Lozada requirements need not always be rigidly applied); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331,1335 (9th Cir. 2000), amended by 213 F.3d 1221 (9th Cir. 2000) (application of Lozada requirements generally reasonable unless facts relating to claim of ineffective assistance of counsel are apparent in the record). Finally, the respondents have not established that they were prejudiced by any ineffective assistance of counsel. See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, 320 F.3d 1061 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondents are permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondents fail to so depart, the respondents shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
*2 NOTICE: If the respondents fail to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the respondents shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief-under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nwadibia, Rochelle A. Fortier
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated June 13, 2001. Although entitled one for reconsideration, the respondent’s motion is correctly characterized as one to reopen as she seeks to introduce new, previously unavailable evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The motion is time-barred as it was filed on March 31, 2004, far more than 90 days after the Board’s June 13, 2001, decision. Id. The motion is also number-barred as it is the second such motion filed by the respondent. Id. The respondent has submitted an order from a district court in conjunction with her motion which reduces her conviction for theft from a third degree felony to a class A misdemeanor. However, this record does not identify on what basis the respondent’s conviction was reduced. As such, we are unable to ascertain whether the state court action was taken pursuant to a rehabilitative statute or to ameliorate the immigration consequences of the conviction. See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003) (holding that the vacating of an alien’s conviction for possession of a controlled substance for the sole purpose of avoiding the bar to his acquisition of permanent residence did not eliminate the conviction for immigration purposes). As the respondent’s conviction remains final for immigration purposes, the respondent has not shown that she is prima facie eligible for the relief she seeks and we do not find that an exercise of our sua sponte authority to reopen is warranted. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I&N Dec. 1378 (BIA 2000). Finally, the respondent vaguely asserts that she has an unidentified “claim for ineffective assistance of counsel,” but has not complied with any of the requirements for such a claim as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Therefore, reopening on that basis is not warranted. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge finding the respondent had not established good cause to have his hearing continued on March 20, 2003. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
McHaffey, David K., ESQUIRE
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 15, 2003. The respondent’s first motion to reopen was filed by his former counsel. The respondent has now raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against him that is compliant with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The number limitations for motions to reopen, found in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii), is waived, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the merits of the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hamud, Randall B., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael P. Rummel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent accepted a grant of voluntary departure. He later married a United States citizen. He submitted a motion to reopen, claiming ineffective assistance because his counsel failed to withdraw his request for voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding that the respondent failed to satisfy the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). On appeal, the respondent offers for the first time evidence that he has filed a complaint against his former counsel for a failure to file a visa petition upon which a motion to reopen could have been based. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal, and notes that the respondent’s complaint against his former counsel was investigated and closed without action.
 
The Ninth Circuit has stated that strict compliance with the Lozada requirements is not necessary where the goals of that decision have been met. See Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934 (9th Cir. 2003). However, we find that in this case, these goals have not been met. The respondent’s complaint against his former attorney filed with the disciplinary committee is inconsistent with his motion to reopen and affidavit. The respondent originally claimed ineffective assistance during the hearing regarding a failure to withdraw a request for voluntary departure, and on appeal now claims ineffective assistance in post-hearing relief. We find that, in both cases, the respondent has not demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not presented clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood that the marriage is bona fide under the standard set forthat 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(B). See Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec.253 (2002). The respondent has not demonstrated his prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. We conclude that the Immigration Judge appropriately denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Waiver of inadmissibility
 
We adopt and affirm the May 19, 2003, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility and all other forms of relief from removal. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). During the hearing on September 11, 2002, the respondent was ordered to file with the Immigration Judge an application for relief from removal by November 12, 2002 (Tr. at 5). However, he failed to do so. Accordingly, we agree that the respondent has abandoned his application for relief from removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c).
 
The respondent has raised on appeal a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, resulting in his failure to submit a completed application for relief from removal by the court-imposed deadline of November 12, 2002. He submitted a copy of a complaint which he filed against his former attorney with the New York State Bar, as well as the attorney’s response. Overall, the evidence does not support the respondent’s contention that his failure to file a timely application for relief from removal was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bassey Akpaffiong, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John Donovan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. Based on a claim of ineffective assistance of prior counsel, the Nigerian respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision dated June 17, 2004, in which we denied his prior motion to reopen our June 30, 2003, decision. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion, in which the respondent seeks a further opportunity to pursue applications for cancellation of removal and voluntary departure.
 
With his current motion, the respondent has submitted a June 18, 2004, letter in support of his statement that the State Bar of Texas has notified his former counsel of his bar complaint. He asserts that he has complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for further consideration based on his reiterated claim of ineffective assistance of prior counsel.
 
Regarding our denial of the respondent’s prior motion to reopen for cancellation of removal, we find no basis for granting his motion to reconsider. On December 14, 2001, the Immigration Judge, whose decision we summarily affirmed on June 30, 2003, found in part that the respondent had not met the physical presence, good moral character, or exceptional and extremely unusual hardship requirements for cancellation of removal. When we denied the motion to reopen in June 2004, we noted: “Even if the respondent could have produced additional evidence as to his physical presence and good moral character, he did not explain how the Immigration Judge’s finding as to exceptional and extremely unusual hardship would have been different had the respondent not had ineffective assistance of counsel.” Thus, even assuming arguendo that the respondent complied with the Lozada requirements, we find no basis for granting his motion to reconsider this aspect of the prior decision, because he did not show any resulting prejudice from any ineffective assistance of prior counsel.
 
With respect to voluntary departure, however, we find that we previously overlooked an aspect of the respondent’s case. During the proceedings below, the Immigration Judge incorrectly stated that the respondent was ineligible for voluntary departure as an arriving alien (Tr. at 10). If, as in this case, an alien has been physically present in the United States for 1 year immediately preceding the date the Notice to Appear was served, voluntary departure is available to an arriving alien at the conclusion of the proceedings. See section 240B(b)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(1)(A). Compare section 240B(a)(4) of the Act (providing that an arriving alien is not eligible for voluntary departure before the conclusion of removal proceedings). Moreover, the good moral character requirements for cancellation purposes are not identical to those for voluntary departure. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c); see Matter of Arguelles, 22 I&N Dec. 811 (BIA 1999) (regarding voluntary departure at the conclusion of removal proceedings). Our decision summarily affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision was erroneous regarding voluntary departure, and our denial of his motion to reopen did not address whether the respondent was prejudiced by his former counsel’s erroneous concession that as an arriving alien the respondent was ineligible for voluntary departure at the conclusion of removal proceedings (Tr. at 10-11). Under these circumstances, we shall grant the motion to reconsider for the limited purpose of affording the respondent an opportunity to apply for voluntary departure.
 
*2 Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider the Board’s June 17, 2004, decision is denied to the extent that it denied his motion to reopen for cancellation of removal.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider the Board’s June 17, 2004, decision is granted to the extent that it pertains to his potential eligibility for voluntary departure; the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision on his application for voluntary departure.

File: AXX XX8 270 - New York

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Karen Jaffe, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on August 27, 2002. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before November 25, 2002. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until June 10, 2004. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time.
 
The respondent has made several vague statements concerning the level of representation he has received both from a travel agency posing as a law firm, as well as from other attorneys, and asserts that he has been a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Despite these assertions, we note the respondent has not complied with the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). For an untimely motion to receive the benefit of equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance, the alien must exercise due diligence in pursuing the case during the period to be tolled. The final administrative order was issued by the Board in 2002. Inasmuch as the respondent has waited almost 2 years before filing the instant motion, he has not exercised due diligence in pursuing remedies available to him with regards to the alleged ineffective assistance violations.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Phillip F. Fishman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julia A. Cline
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)º - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; change of venue
 
This case was last before us on March 7, 2003, at which time we granted the respondent’s motion to remand to allow her to pursue an application for adjustment of status before the Immigration Judge. Following the Immigration Court’s April 22, 2003, issuance of an in absentia order of removal in the respondent’s case, the respondent filed a motion to reopen which was denied on July 16, 2003. The respondent now appeals that decision, as well as the Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to change venue. The appeal will be sustained.
 
The respondent contends that her prior attorney was ineffective. Our review of allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are governed by our analysis in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Matter of Lozada, we stated that a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the applicant setting forth in detail the agreement between the applicant and her legal representative and what actions were to be taken on her behalf, (2) that the counsel whose reputation is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) an indication of whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not.
 
Our review of the record reveals that the respondent has met the Lozada standards. The respondent submitted an affidavit setting forth the understanding between her and her attorney and summarizing the facts that led her to elect not to appear for her hearing. See Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider, Reopen, and Rescind In Absentia Order and Motion to Change Venue (“Respondent’s Motion”) at Exh. C. Additionally, not only has the respondent’s former attorney been informed of the charges against her, the attorney has taken it upon herself to report her own ineffective assistance to her state bar association’s office of professional responsibility. See Respondent’s Motion at Exh. D. This satisfies the final two prongs of the Lozada test. We have also previously found that where an alien’s failure to appear for a hearing is due to the ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has demonstrated “exceptional circumstances” for her failure to appear. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). We therefore find that the respondent’s motion to reopen was meritorious and deserving of a favorable exercise of discretion.
 
*2 We turn next to the respondent’s motion to change venue. An Immigration Judge’s discretion to change venue is subject to the existence of good cause for such a change. See Matter of Rahman, 20 I&N Dec. 480, 482 (BIA 1992). Good cause is determined by balancing the factors we have found relevant to the venue issue. See id. at 482-83 (holding that relevant factors include administrative convenience, expeditious treatment of the case, location of witnesses, and cost of transporting witnesses or evidence to a new location). The party moving for a change of venue must show that he would be materially prejudiced if the hearing were conducted in the venue from which he is requesting a change. See id. at 484. The respondent stated the following facts in support of her motion: she has resided in Minnesota since September 1999; the respondent married in January 2001; her husband, now a naturalized United States citizen, filed a visa petition on her behalf; the visa petition has been approved; the expense of travel from Minnesota to San Diego by the respondent and the witnesses in support of her adjustment application would be prohibitive. See Respondent’s Motion. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not opposed the change of venue on appeal. Inasmuch as it appears that the DHS would not be prejudiced by a change in venue, but that the respondent may indeed be prejudiced by a denial of the request, we find that a change of venue would be appropriate. See Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688, 690 (BIA 1988).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to change venue is granted, and venue is changed from the Immigration Court in San Diego, California, to the Immigration Court in Bloomington, Minnesota.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court in Bloomington for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN RE: FELIPE CHIMIL BULMARO
File: AXX XX7 157 - Los Angeles
July 29, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
D. Jade Mundel, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Tracy Nguyen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on January 8, 2004, when this Board summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of former counsel. He contends that his former counsel did not properly advise the respondent on the submission of evidence to sufficiently establish extreme hardship to his United States citizen daughter, and further contends that his daughter suffers from severe nosebleeds which require frequent treatment and cauterization. He notes that his former counsel failed to submit medical records, letters from doctors as to the cause, frequency or seriousness of his daughter’s condition, and any other evidence such as letters from school personnel. The respondent contends that these errors and omissions on the part of the former counsel constituted ineffective assistance which contributed to the negative decision in his case.
 
In support of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has submitted an affidavit, and it appears that a complaint was filed with the California State Bar, although the form is not dated and there is no indication when it was filed. There also is no indication that the respondent’s former attorney has been informed of the allegations leveled against her and that she has been given an opportunity to respond. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Consequently, we do not find that the respondent has established ineffective assistance of counsel. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004) (alien did not substantially satisfy Lozada because he failed to submit an affidavit and could not prove that he gave former attorney notice of the ineffective assistance allegations or an adequate opportunity to respond). Furthermore, the respondent has failed to submit any medical or other documentation with his motion to support his claim that his daughter would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship due to her medical condition, if she were to accompany the respondent to Mexico. Therefore, the respondent has failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel or to show prejudice due to his former attorney’s failure to submit additional documentation regarding the respondent’s daughter and the hardship she would suffer.
 
*2 Moreover, pursuant to section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), an alien who fails to depart following a grant of voluntary departure, and who has been provided written and oral notice of the consequences of remaining in the United States, is statutorily barred from applying for certain forms of discretionary relief absent a showing of exceptional circumstances for failing to depart. See Matter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996). As the respondent was given written and oral notice of the consequences of failing to depart and failed to comply with the order granting such relief, the respondent is ineligible for the relief sought. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: SHURLAND OVID SINGH
File: A36 498 686 - Napanoch
July 29, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Winston D. Tucker, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Waiver of inadmissibility; motion to remand
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 5, 2004, decision finding that he abandoned his application for relief under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), for failure to timely file and ordering him removed from the United States. During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and/or reconsider.1 The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed, and the motion will be denied.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in not extending the March 1, 2004, deadline set for the submission of the respondent’s application for a waiver under former section 212(c) of the Act because the respondent is eligible to apply for said relief. See Respondent’s Notice of Appeal attachment. In this regard, we note that all documents and applications that are to be considered in a proceeding before an Immigration Judge must be filed with the Immigration Court having administrative control over the record of proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(a) (2004). In addition, the Immigration Judge may set and extend time limits for the filing of applications and related documents and responses thereto, if any. If an application is not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application shall be deemed waived. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c); Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547 (BIA 1992). As a result, we find that the record supports the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent abandoned his application for a section 212(c) waiver by failing to file it in a timely manner. Matter of R-R-, supra.
 
Through his motion to remand, the respondent, through new counsel, claims that he has been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel because his former attorney failed to timely file his application for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 1-2. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. Importantly, it also requires that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Aassad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 In the instant case, the respondent has failed to meet these requirements. In particular, the respondent’s motion does not include either an affidavit setting forth the details of the agreement, if any, that was entered into between the respondent and former counsel nor does it include any evidence indicating that former counsel has been given any notice of the respondent’s grievances or the opportunity to respond.2 See Matter of Lozada, supra. In addition, there is no evidence that a complaint has been filed with any appropriate disciplinary authority with respect to any of former counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities toward the respondent. Id. The respondent has, thus, failed to comply with the technical obligations of Lozada.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and the motion is denied.

IN THE MATTER OF: SHURLAND OVID SINGH
Case No.: A36-498-686
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
ORDER
On January 30, 2004, the above entitled matter was heard at the Ulster Correctional Facility Master Calendar session. The respondent was represented by counsel, Brian Figeroux. The Immigration Judge then took pleadings and found that alienage and removability were established by clear and convincing evidence. The respondent was then found to be eligible to file for relief under both cancellation of removal, or under Section 212(c) of the Act. Respondent, through counsel elected to file for the 212(c) relief and to forego any relief under Cancellation of Removal. He was then instructed to file his Form I-191 with the Court. The Immigration Judge instructed the respondent and counsel that his completed Form I-191 was to be returned to the Court not later than March 1, 2004, or he would be deported for failure to file his application. He was given an adjournment in which he was to complete and return the necessary documents. As of today’s date, March 5, 2004, the documents have still not been filed with the Immigration Court as instructed. There is no relief available to this respondent other than under 212(c).
 
*3 The necessary documents were not received by the filing deadline. Therefore, it is deemed that the respondent in this case has abandoned his opportunity to file for the requested relief.
 
Wherefore, the issue of removability having been resolved against the respondent, and since he has abandoned all possible relief by failing to file in a timely manner, the following order is entered:
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT THE RESPONDENT BE REMOVED FROM THE UNITED STATES, AND DEPORTED TO GUYANA FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH IN THE NOTICE TO APPEAR.

The record reflects that the respondent, through his prior attorney, timely filed his Notice of Appeal (Form EO1R-26) on March 26, 2004. On or about April 5, 2004, new counsel for the respondent filed a Notice of Appearance (Form EOIR-27). Along with the Notice of Appearance, new counsel filed a motion to reopen and reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in regard to the respondent’s prior attorney. The respondent’s motion will be treated as a motion to remand as it was filed during the pendency of his appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2.

The respondent’s motion includes an unsworn “affidavit” from the respondent’s mother. In this document, the respondent’s mother claims that she paid former counsel for his services in filing the application for a section 212(c) waiver, but that former counsel failed to do so.

IN RE: FELIPE ARRONA-ORTEGA MARTINA LOPEZ DE ARRONA
File: A90 560 516 - San Diego
A90 560 517
July 29, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carlos A. Batara, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael P. Rummel
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondents timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 12, 2003, denying the respondents’ motion to reopen the removal proceedings. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondents’ removal from the United States, following the respondents’ failure to appear for a hearing on May 14, 2002. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that in a decision dated November 13, 1998, an Immigration Judge denied the respondents’ applications for cancellation of removal and voluntary departure. The respondents timely appealed, and on March 20, 2002, the Board remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.1 The San Diego Immigration Court sent the hearing notice to Kevin Tracy, Esquire, who had represented the respondents before the Immigration Judge and on appeal. Neither the respondents nor Mr. Tracy appeared for the hearing on May 14, 2002, and the respondents were ordered removed in absentia.
 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has submitted a brief on appeal, and indicates that the lead respondent, Felipe Arrona-Ortega (A90 560 516), was removed from the United States to Mexico on June 6, 2003. DHS submitted a copy of the executed Warrant of Removal/Deportation, Form I-205, dated June 5, 2003. See DHS Appeal Brief, Attachment A. Therefore, the record reflects that the respondent was removed from the United States subsequent to the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen.2 Consequently, the Board lacks jurisdiction to reopen the lead respondent’s proceedings. See Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, 330 F.3d 672 (5th Cir. 2003).
 
We will now consider respondent Martina Lopez de Arrona’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. The respondents actually filed a memorandum in support of appeal and motion to reopen under Matter of Lozada. This is the respondents’ first attempt to comply with Lozada, as their motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge only argued lack of proper notice. The respondents did submit an affidavit with their motion to reopen. However, it only pertained to the issue of notice and not any alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. On appeal the respondents have submitted a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. They have submitted an affidavit; respondents’ current counsel avers that their former counsel, Kevin Tracy, Esquire, has been notified of the allegations against him; and they indicate that the incident has been reported to the California State Bar. The respondents contend that the in absentia hearing on May 14, 2002, was fundamentally unfair and greatly prejudiced them, and that their chance to present any type of claim in Immigration Court after the Board remand was destroyed.
 
*2 In a decision dated November 13, 1998, the Immigration Judge determined that the lead respondent, Felipe Arrona-Onega, was not statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal for certain non-permanent residents due to his conviction for an aggravated felony. Subsequently, the Board remanded the record for a determination of the effect of the Court’s Trinidad-Aquino decision on the issue of the lead respondent’s removability. See U.S. v. Trinidad-Aquino, 259 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir. 2001) (the offense of driving under the influence is not a crime of violence as that term is defined in the Act, and therefore cannot support a finding of removability). As respondent Martina Lopez de Arrona was charged as an alien present without being admitted, the Immigration Judge considered her application for cancellation of removal, but ultimately determined that the respondents had failed to establish that any of their children would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if they were returned to Mexico.
 
Based on the actions of the respondents’ former counsel and the respondents’ substantial compliance with Lozada, we find that they established ineffective assistance of counsel. However, we do not find that respondent Martina Lopez de Arrona has suffered any prejudice, particularly in light of the Immigration Judge’s prior denial of her application for cancellation of removal due to lack of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to any of her children and the absence of any current allegation that respondent’s removal would cause her children to now meet the level of hardship required. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

We note that the Board’s remand was based on the Ninth Circuit Court’s decision in U.S. v. Trinidad-Aquino, 259 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir. 2001) (the offense of driving under the influence is not a crime of violence as that term is defined in the Act, and therefore cannot support a finding of removability).

We note that the respondent signed the Notice of Appeal on June 5, 2003, but it was not filed with the Immigration Court until June 9, 2003. The Warrant of Removal/Deportation is dated June 5, 2003. As the respondent was removed following the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen, the removal was lawful. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); see also Wiedersperg v. INS, 896 F.2d 1179 (9th Cir. 1990).

IN RE: AI HAO JIANG
File: A73 561 616 - New York

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Yong Men, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
On appeal the respondent raises the issue of ineffective assistance of former counsel for the first time. With his appeal he has submitted a copy of a complaint and his statement filed with the Departmental Disciplinary Committee, Supreme Court, Appellate Division. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, supra. However, the respondent has not submitted any evidence that his former counsel has been informed of the allegations against him, as required by Matter of Lozada, supra. Furthermore, the Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995).
 
The respondent also sought reopening to apply for adjustment of status. However, he did not submit any documents in support of his motion to reopen regarding adjustment of status. On appeal the respondent has submitted an approval notice and an application for adjustment of status.1 An alien is not required to rescind his or her deportation order under section 242B of the Act if he or she is pursuing an application for new relief, and provided there is no evidence that the respondent received the required warnings under section 242B(e) of the Act. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). Rather, the motion to reopen is only subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3).2 Under these standards, the respondent is precluded from having his motion considered. The record reflects that the respondent received oral warnings in his native language of the consequences of failing to appear at a scheduled hearing.3 Thus he is not eligible to reopen proceedings on this basis. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Priscilla Wong, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Arrived at a time or place not designated by the Attorney General (both respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Continuance; cancellation of removal
 
The respondents appeal from an Immigration Judge decision denying them a continuance and denying their application for cancellation of removal. They also argue that they were ineffectively served by previous counsel. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondents appeared before an Immigration Judge, with counsel, on September 25, 2001, at which time a hearing was scheduled to consider their application for cancellation of removal and an application for relief was submitted. When they returned for the individual hearing, 18 months later, they were represented by new counsel who had been retained a week previously and had inadequate time to prepare to argue the case. New counsel requested a continuance to better prepare, but this was denied. The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; see Gonzalez v. INS, 82 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 1996); Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996). Here, the respondents had 18 months in which to prepare their case and did not file their motion for a continuance until a few days before the scheduled merits hearing (Tr. at 8-9; Exh 5). We find no reason to question the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that good cause has not been shown for the granting of a continuance.
 
A continuance, however, would have been appropriate, and our remanding of the record would now be proper, if the respondents had been ineffectively served by their previous counsel such that they were denied a fair hearing. We cannot find this to be the case. We first note that we agree with the respondents that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit requires substantial, but not complete, compliance with the requirements for proving ineffective assistance we laid out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Lin v. Ashcroft, 356 F.3d 1027 (9th Cir. 2004).
 
Here, not only have the respondents failed to comply with Lozada, but, more importantly, the record does not support a conclusion that they were ineffectively served by previous counsel. It appears rather that the respondents, themselves, ineffectively pursued their avenues of relief. There is no indication in the record that the respondents had any agreement, before the one with the newest attorney, with anyone to represent them beyond the master calender hearing in September of 2001. Further, although the lead respondent has submitted an affidavit, it does not claim that he attempted to contact his previous attorney in the 18 months between the master hearing and the Immigration Judge’s order, nor does he claim to have had any agreement for representation. The affidavit simply states that there was no further communication with the attorney, that someone informed him of the needed documents 6 months before the hearing, that he was told how to arrange them 2 weeks before the hearing, and, finally, that he contacted the newer attorney who requested the continuance shortly before the individual hearing. For his part, the attorney who appeared in court for the respondents at the master hearing has submitted an affidavit indicating that it was his understanding that he was only to represent the respondents at that hearing.
 
*2 Although the respondent argues that the situation on its face shows ineffective assistance of counsel, this is simply not the case. The evidence presented and the arguments made fall well short of this goal. The respondents’ application was not presented in an effective manner, but it does not appear that the fault lies with previous counsel. First, there is no evidence in the record of any agreement between the respondents and any previous counsel and the lead respondent makes no claim that any such agreement existed. Further, he makes no claim to have attempted to contact previous counsel during the 18 months between the master and individual hearings. Also, it is not made clear why, if he believed he was already being represented by previous counsel, he sought out new representation so close to the date of his hearing. As we find insufficient evidence of any ineffective assistance of counsel, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to so depart, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John Donovan
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, was ordered removed by an Immigration Judge in an order dated August 9, 2002. This Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from such decision on December 16, 2003. The respondent has filed a motion to “reopen and reconsider,” arguing that her prior counsel was ineffective in that he failed to file a timely appeal brief on her behalf. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion.
 
We find that the respondent has failed to comply with the procedural requirements we set forth in our decision Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), which governs our review of allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
In Matter of Lozada, we stated that a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement between the respondent and his legal representative and what actions were to be taken on his behalf, (2) that the counsel whose reputation is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) an indication of whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not.
 
The respondent has submitted a copy of a “Grievance Form” that she allegedly filed with the State Bar of Texas, in which she complains of her representation by her former counsel, Mr. Robert E. Kahn, Esquire. The respondent has informed the State Bar that Mr. Kahn “failed to appeal on time” which has “created a problem” for her “legal status.” See Grievance Form.
 
The respondent has complied with the Lozada requirements only insofar as she may have informed the appropriate disciplinary authorities of her grievance against her former counsel. Importantly, there is no evidence that the respondent has actually informed Mr. Kahn of the allegation she has made against him. Indeed, in her motion, the respondent asserts only that a copy of the complaint “will be served” on Mr. Kahn, not that it has been served on him so that he may have an opportunity to respond to the allegations.
 
*2 In addition, the respondent has failed to set forth, in detail, the agreement she had with Mr. Kahn. Notably, the minimal information the respondent allegedly provided to the State Bar appears to be incorrect. The respondent alleges in her complaint that Mr. Kahn did not file a timely appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision. However, a timely appeal was, in fact, filed on the respondent’s behalf. Instead, it was simply the appeal brief which counsel did not timely file, although he did subsequently attempt to file a “motion to remand” which essentially set forth the reasons why he believed the Immigration Judge’s decision was incorrect.
 
Accordingly, we find that the respondent has failed to comply with the Lozada procedural requirements. Moreover, even if the respondent had complied with the procedural requirements in support of her allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel, we find that the respondent has not adequately demonstrated that Mr. Kahn’s representation caused her any prejudice. It does not appear that the respondent has any relief available to her from removal in these proceedings. During the August 9, 2002, hearing, the respondent’s counsel informed the Immigration Judge that the respondent had an “E visa” application pending before the DHS, and that she should know within 3 or 4 months if such visa was approved (Tr. at 10-11). We note that neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board has any authority over the approval of such visas. In addition, even though almost 2 years have passed since such hearing, the respondent has never informed the Board of the status of her petition before the DHS.
 
In light of the foregoing, the respondent’s motion is denied.

IN RE: SEBASTIANA GONCALVES-LOPES DE SILVA
File: AXX XX5 810 - Las Vegas
July 8, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ligia M. Madeira, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 29, 2002, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings and to change venue. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States, following the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing on May 23, 2002. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
On appeal and in her motion to reopen, the respondent contends that she demonstrated exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear, based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the respondent contends that she did not receive notice from her former attorney, Paul Glickman. The respondent indicated that she only communicated with a Brazilian paralegal, Mr. Alves, who acted as an interpreter for the respondent at a meeting with Mr. Glickman. Apparently all parties agreed that Mr. Alves would act as a liaison for the respondent since she was unable to communicate with Mr. Glickman in English. The respondent gave $500 to Mr. Alves, who failed to pay Mr. Glickman for further representation of the respondent before the Immigration Court. Consequently, since Mr. Glickman had not yet received his retainer, he was no longer working on her case. The respondent contends that neither Mr. Alves nor Mr. Glickman provided her with notice of her hearing scheduled for May 23, 2002. With her motion to reopen, the respondent submitted numerous documents, including her affidavit and Paul Glickman’s affidavit.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, supra.
 
Precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this case arises, provides that while the requirements of Lozada are generally reasonable, they need not be rigidly enforced where their purpose is fully served by other means. Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237, 1240 n.6 (9th Cir. 2000). The Ninth Circuit determined that “Lozada is intended to ensure both that an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra. Furthermore, where the face of the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel, there has been substantial compliance with the rule. Id.
 
*2 The record in the instant case supports the conclusion that based on the totality of circumstances, the respondent has established exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear. It appears that due to the actions of Mr. Alves, Mr. Glickman did not receive his retainer, and he subsequently ceased representing the respondent. Due to her inability to communicate with Mr. Glickman, and the actions of Mr. Alves, the respondent did not receive notice of her hearing. We find that the respondent has presented a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The record will be remanded for further proceedings, and the motion to change venue will be granted.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to change venue is granted, and venue is changed from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Boston, Massachusetts.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Jessica Dominguez, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (both respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before the Board on December 24, 2003, when we summarily dismissed the appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4). The respondents have timely filed a motion to reopen. They argue that ineffective assistance of counsel caused their application for cancellation of removal to be denied. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen may not be granted unless the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). A motion to reopen may not be granted if the respondent fails to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought. Matter of Coelho, supra; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
A motion to reopen based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representation counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and, (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Furthermore, the respondent must show that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance. Id. (citations omitted).
 
Although the respondents provided an affidavit setting forth their complaints (Motion to Reopen, Exh. 2) and attached a copy of a complaint form (Motion to Reopen, Exh. 3), there is no evidence that the respondents’ former attorney was informed of the allegations leveled against him or that he was given an opportunity to respond. As such, the respondents have failed to meet the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 Assuming that the Matter of Lozada, supra, requirements were met, the respondents have failed to show that they were prejudiced by their former representative’s performance. The respondents allege that their former attorney failed to highlight the scholastic success of their son. The basis for the motion, aside from the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, is a letter dated January 5, 2004, indicating that the respondents’ son has now been placed in a “high achiever classroom” (Motion to Reopen, Exh. 4). However, the fact that their son is a sixth grade student who has been placed in a high achiever classroom is insufficient to satisfy the exceptional and extremely unusual hardship standard imposed by Congress. Furthermore, the respondents’ former attorney submitted the scholastic records of their son (AXX-XXX-XXX, Exh. 2 at 13, 34, 37; AXX-XXX-XXX, Exh. 2a at 124), but in prior grades he did not do as well as he is now doing. Since the respondents failed to show that they were prejudiced by their former counsel’s performance, they failed to meet the requirements necessary to reopen a case based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The following order will issue.

File: A71 558 095 - San Antonio

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Linda Irene Perez, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal is untimely. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was rendered orally on October 21, 2003.1 The appeal was accordingly due on or before November 20, 2003. The record reflects, however, that the Notice of Appeal was filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on May 26, 2004. We accordingly find that the appeal is untimely. In conjunction with the appeal, the respondent filed a Respondent’s Motion to Reopen Proceedings in which the respondent is raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as the reason for the untimeliness of the appeal. A State Bar of Texas Grievance Form that was filed with the State Bar of Texas on April 15, 2004 was provided as evidence to support this claim. However, we find that this evidence alone is not enough, and, therefore, we need not address the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel considering the respondent has not fully complied with the requirements as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Thus, the Immigration Judge’s decision is therefore now final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.3(a), 3.38, 3.39, 240.14 and 240.15.
 
We note that because we have dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, Interim Decision 3343 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § § 3.2(c)(2), 3.23(b)(1); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).

We note that the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent the relief of cancellation of removal under section 240A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b, and granting voluntary departure upon posting a $500.00 bond erroneously indicates that this decision was rendered on September 5, 2003 instead of October 21, 2003.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lawrence E. Rushton, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on February 25, 2004, when we summarily affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal for failure to timely file the application. On May 5, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen.
 
A motion to reopen before the Board seeks a second review of a case by the Board based on new or previously unavailable evidence. The motion must state the new facts to be proved and must be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). A motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. Id. The decision whether to grant a motion to reopen is within the discretion of the Board. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
In her motion to reopen, the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of former counsel, Robert E. Kahn. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Specifically, the respondent contends that Mr. Kahn failed to pursue all forms of relief available to the respondent by not submitting an application on her behalf as a derivative beneficiary pursuant to the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), although she is the spouse of a NACARA applicant who obtained his lawful permanent residency. She also contends that Mr. Kahn advised her to pursue the relief of cancellation of removal for a non-lawful permanent resident, but he failed to timely file her application by the deadline set by the Immigration Judge, resulting in the Immigration Judge’s finding that her application for cancellation of removal had been abandoned. The respondent states that Mr. Kahn has been contacted regarding the allegations and has submitted a response from him. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Exh. E. Furthermore, the respondent has submitted evidence that she has filed a grievance against Mr. Kahn with the State Bar of Texas. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Exh. F.
 
In the case at bar, the respondent’s former attorney has admitted that the application for cancellation was not timely filed, and he regrets that the respondent’s case was pretermitted due to his error. We find that the respondent has presented a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and the proceedings will be reopened and remanded for further proceedings.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John Ayala, Esquire
*1 An Immigration Judge issued an order of removal against the respondent on March 22, 2000. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on September 18, 2002. The respondent thereafter sought to have proceedings reopened in order to pursue an application for adjustment of status, based on marriage to a United States citizen. We denied the motion to reopen on August 25, 2003, finding that relief was barred because the respondent failed to voluntarily depart the United States as ordered on September 18, 2002. See section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d)(alien who fails to depart following a grant of voluntary departure is statutorily barred from applying for certain forms of discretionary relief, including adjustment of status). The respondent has filed another motion to reopen on January 23, 2004, blaming former counsel for the earlier motion being denied.
 
We will grant the pending motion, and remand the case to the Immigration Judge for additional proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion.
 
Although the motion to reopen was filed late, and was the second motion to reopen filed, we have determined that it is appropriate to reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The respondent asserts that he was told that an attorney would enter an appearance with this Board prior to our September 18, 2002, decision. The respondent then moved and was promised that counsel would notify the Board of his new address. The respondent asserts that the attorney did not inform the Board of his address change, and failed to enter an appearance prior to our September 18, 2002, decision. The respondent asserts that the attorney then filed the first motion to reopen without his knowledge. The respondent states that he was unaware of either of our prior decisions until December, 2003, and the pending motion was filed the next month. The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The immediate relative visa petition was approved on October 23, 2001. On remand to the Immigration Judge the respondent will have an opportunity to present his application for relief. The DHS shall have the opportunity to examine and verify the validity of the respondent’s submissions and present evidence.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s pending motion is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s order of August 25, 2003, is rescinded.
 
*2 FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Neil H. Afran, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law (all respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
On October 8, 2002, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondents removed in absentia. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). On April 8, 2003, the respondents filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge alleging they had failed to appear due to the advice of a non-attorney who had fraudulently claimed to be an attorney (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen on April 25, 2003, and the respondents have now appealed from that decision. We will dismiss the appeal.
 
The Immigration Judge held that the respondents failed to meet the documentary requirements for a motion to reopen based on the ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 3).1 See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). The respondents have documented their claim against Karen Fotiou, who fraudulently claimed to be an attorney and incorrectly advised the respondents they did not need to appear for their October 8, 2002, hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to withdraw of the attorney the respondents had retained before hiring Fotiou, however, and an attorney named David Hawkins attempted to enter an appearance on behalf of the respondents at their October 8 hearing for Fotiou. Under these circumstances, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s holding that the respondents need to satisfy the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance against these attorneys as well, and not just Fotiou (I.J. at 3). The respondents have not addressed their failure to do so in their appeal.
 
We note that the respondents’ first attorney’s motion to withdraw appears to have met the requirements for such a motion. See Matter of Rosales, 19 I&N Dec. 655 (BIA 1988). Nevertheless, the attorney remained the respondents’ attorney of record after the denial of her motion to withdraw and, consequently, is also implicated in the respondents’ claim of exceptional circumstances for having failed to appear at their October 8, 2002, hearing. We disagree with the respondents’ assertion that a transcript is required for adequate review of the respondents’ appeal. Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal for the respondents’ failure to satisfy the requirements of Matter of Lozada for both their attorney of record at the time of their October 8 hearing and the attorney that attempted to enter an appearance on their behalf at that hearing.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The Immigration Judge also noted that the respondent’s motion was filed more than 180 days after the date of the removal order, but did not rely on this untimeliness in denying their motion (I.J. at 2-3). See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondents’ motion had to have been filed on or before Monday, April 7, 2003, since the 180 day deadline expired on Sunday, April 6. The motion was actually filed on April 8, 2003, with a letter from the respondents’ attorney explaining that he had attempted to file the motion on April 7, but the clerk’s office had closed early due to snow.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; remand.
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent is a native and citizen of Tunisia. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s December 5, 2002, decision finding the respondent removable as charged and denying his motion for a continuance in order to file an I-140 petition. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and his motion to remand will be denied. The request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e).
 
On appeal, the respondent avers that he did not have the opportunity to explain his case to the Immigration Judge. However, the record reflects that the respondent did explain his case to the Immigration Judge, during four separate hearings, over a period of 15 months. The record also reflects that the Immigration Judge granted the respondent three continuances, during that period, in order to allow the respondent to pursue a diversity visa, an I-130 visa petition, and an I-140 visa petition. The respondent and the counsel from the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) realized that there had been multiple problems with the respondent’s pursuit of his diversity visa, thus, both parties agreed to adjudicate the respondent’s adjustment application in court. See Tr. at 13. The Immigration Judge informed the respondent that he would need to retrieve his documents, relating to his adjustment application, from DHS and have them ready for his next hearing. See Tr. at 14. The counsel for DHS informed the respondent’s counsel that it would not agree to a motion to terminate in order for the respondent to pursue the diversity visa. Id. However, 9 months later the respondent came to court without the requested documents and indicated that he had failed to file his I-140, although he knew that his diversity visa was not approved by the September, 2002 deadline. See Tr. at 17. As the respondent had already been granted prior continuances, over a period of 15 months, we do not find that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion by failing to grant the respondent an additional continuance. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.6.
 
In addition, we note that the respondent’s counsel was told, by the Immigration Judge, that the respondent’s motion for a further continuance was denied and that he needed to qualify the respondent for voluntary departure. See Tr. at 18. However, the respondent’s counsel continued to contest the denial of his motion for a continuance. Id. The Immigration Judge asked the respondent’s counsel if he understood the Court’s order, which was that the motion for a continuance was denied and that he must qualify the respondent for voluntary departure. Id. The respondent’s counsel replied in the affirmative and then continued to contest the denial of his motion for a continuance. Id. The Immigration Judge again indicated that the respondent’s motion was denied and instructed the respondent’s counsel to qualify the respondent for voluntary departure. See Tr. at 19. The respondent’s counsel failed to do so and the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed as charged. Id. We do not find that the Immigration Judge erred in ordering the respondent removed after the respondent’s counsel failed to qualify the respondent for voluntary departure. We note that the respondent has not claimed that he received ineffective assistance of counsel according to the requirements delineated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed and his motion to remand is denied.

IN RE: LI, MEI YING

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Cox, Theodore N., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Susan Egan,
Assistant District Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated January 3, 2003. The respondent asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and also requests reopening pursuant to the Board’s sua sponte authority. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the respondent’s motion.
 
At the outset, we note that the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel appears to be based on allegations against both Mr. Andrew J. Wilson, her former attorney of record before the Immigration Court, and Mr. Xiong He of AmeProfessional Group. However, the record does not indicate that Mr. He or the AmeProfessional Group had at any time acted as the respondent’s legal representative, nor has the respondent offered any evidence to establish that they are in any way affiliated with her former counsel. As such, with respect to the respondent’s Lozada claim, we find it appropriate to limit our consideration to solely the respondent’s allegations against Mr. Wilson, her former attorney of record.
 
We find that the respondent has failed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. Specifically, since the record indicates that notice to Mr. Wilson was mailed on the same day that the respondent’s motion was submitted to the Board (see Exh. A of Motion), we cannot reasonably conclude that the respondent has complied with the requirement that “before allegations of ineffective assistance of former counsel are presented to the Board, former counsel must be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond.” Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639 (emphasis added). Moreover, we are not convinced that the respondent’s former counsel was sufficiently informed of the allegations against him, based on the brief description of the respondent’s allegations in the letter to former counsel (see Exh. A of Motion. There is no indication that the respondent attached to the letter to Mr. Wilson any additional information relating to her allegations). We further note that in her affidavit, the respondent has asserted only general allegations that her former counsel “did not review or prepare the case” with her (see Respondent’s Affidavit in Exh. A to Motion). The respondent has submitted no additional evidence to support these allegations, or to demonstrate how counsel’s conduct may have affected the outcome of her case. Furthermore, in our review of the record, we find that the respondent received a fair and complete hearing before the Immigration Judge, and was provided ample opportunity to present her claim for relief. In all, we cannot conclude that respondent has established that she has suffered prejudice as a result of former counsel’s conduct, such that it is likely that she would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Matter of Aassad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640.
 
*2 In light of the foregoing, we find that the respondent has failed to satisfy the requirements for proving that she was ineffectively represented or was prejudiced by her former counsel in these proceedings. We further find that the respondent has failed to state any “exceptional circumstances” that would warrant our granting her motion to reopen sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Cox, Theodore N., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Susan Egan,
Assistant District Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated January 3, 2003. The respondent asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and also requests reopening pursuant to the Board’s sua sponte authority. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the respondent’s motion.
 
At the outset, we note that the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel appears to be based on allegations against both Mr. Andrew J.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: IGNACIO MARTINEZ GARCIA
File: AXX XX3 887 - Los Angeles
June 23, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raul Gomez, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge dated May 12, 2003. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent failed to establish the requisite continuous physical presence for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). See section 240A(b)(1)(A) of the Act. Moreover, the respondent failed to show that his two United States citizen children would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if he is returned to Mexico (Tr. at 10-12, 18-19). See section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act.
 
On appeal, the respondent apparently alleges ineffective assistance by former counsel. In Lozada, we laid out the requirements that the respondent must meet in order to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. First, the motion should be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent attesting to the relevant facts. Second, before the allegation is presented to the Board, the former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond. Any subsequent response from counsel, or report of counsel’s failure or refusal to respond should be submitted with the motion. Finally, if it is asserted that prior counsel’s handling of the case involved a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, the motion should reflect “whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not.” Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where this case arises, has found the application of the noted requirements to generally be reasonable, but has held that “they need not be rigidly enforced where their purpose is fully served by other means.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). Here, however, the respondent has failed to even minimally fulfill any of the above-noted requirements. As such, reopening on this basis is not warranted.
 
Additionally, the respondent has failed to show prejudice. “Due process challenges to deportation proceedings require a showing of prejudice to succeed.” Castillo-Perez v. I.N.S., 212 F.3d 518, 527 (9th Cir. 2000). “Prejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999) (quoting Barraza Rivera v. INS, 913 F.2d 1443, 1448 (9th Cir. 1990)). The respondent here has not met this requirement. Specifically, the respondent has failed to proffer what evidence his former counsel failed to submit regarding the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal. Consequently, we find that the respondent has failed to establish that his former counsel’s performance was so inadequate that it may have changed the outcome of the proceedings.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to so depart, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: ABDALLAH JAMIL KOURANI
File: AXX XX5 979 - New York
June 18, 2004
 
IN EXCLUSION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT:
 
Neil Richardson Datta, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mary Cheng
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The case was last before the Board on March 8, 1996, when we dismissed the applicant’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision finding the applicant excludable and ordering him deported. The applicant has filed a motion to reopen exclusion proceedings. The motion will be denied.
 
The applicant’s motion asserts that he had reasonable cause for failing to appear at his exclusion hearing because he did not receive notice. He also claims that due to ineffective assistance of counsel prior counsel failed to properly pursue his appeal with the Board.
 
The applicant’s argument that he had a reasonable excuse for failing to appear due to a lack of notice will be construed as a motion to reconsider since we previously addressed the argument in our decision dated March 8, 1996. A motion to reconsider a decision must be filed with the Board within 30 days after the mailing of the Board decision or on or before July 31, 1996, whichever is later. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). In this case, the motion was filed on May 12, 2004, more than 8 years after the Board’s decision. As such, the applicant’s motion is untimely.
 
Even if the argument had been timely raised, it is without merit. A motion to reconsider requests that the original decision be reexamined in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Upon review of the motion to reconsider and record of proceedings, we find no new legal argument or particular aspect of the case which was overlooked and no ground upon which to reconsider our previous decision. In fact, the applicant’s argument completely fails to address the evidence of record reflecting that the applicant was personally served with a written hearing notice advising him of his next hearing. Accordingly, the applicant’s argument construed as a motion to reconsider, is denied.
 
The applicant’s motion also asserts that his case should be reopened due to ineffective assistance of counsel. A motion to reopen based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representation counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and, (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003); cf. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Furthermore, the respondent must show that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance. See Matter of Assaad, supra.
 
*2 While the applicant has submitted an affidavit, the affidavit is contradicted by evidence contained in the record of proceedings. Specifically, the applicant’s affidavit asserts that he retained the law firm of Liz & Botshon in August of 1993. However, a letter from the applicant’s counsel, dated November 9, 1993, requested an extension to file the applicant’s appeal brief because the firm had “just been retained.” Furthermore, the affidavit does not identify the name of the counsel who allegedly provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, the affidavit is insufficient.
 
Lozada also requires that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations and given an opportunity to respond. However, the motion reflects that counsel was informed of the allegations on the same day as the motion was filed with the Board. Thus, counsel was not afforded an opportunity to respond. Furthermore, the complaint filed with the state disciplinary authorities failed to identify a specific attorney that rendered inadequate representation. Moreover, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s performance. While he claims that his appeal would not have been denied if his counsel had filed an affidavit, the Board’s prior decision did not rely solely on the lack of an affidavit as a basis for dismissing the appeal. The Board clearly stated that the record revealed that the applicant had in fact been advised in writing of his hearing and the consequences of failing to appear. Thus, the applicant has failed to establish that his motion should be granted pursuant to Lozada.
 
In addition, the applicant has failed to establish that his motion is subject to equitable tolling because he has not demonstrated due diligence. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000) (filing deadline of motion to reopen may be equitably tolled where alien demonstrated due diligence). Specifically, the applicant failed to file his motion to reopen until more than 10 years after he encountered problems with his prior counsel. Thus, the applicant’s motion to reopen is untimely filed, See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
ORDER: The applicant’s motion is denied.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: VICTOR MENDEZ CHAVEZ
File: AXX XX0 680 - Los Angeles
June 17, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael S. Cabrera, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. An Immigration Judge issued a final order of removal against the respondent on March 21, 2003. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of the Immigration Judge’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38. The appeal was filed late, on April 23, 2003. The respondent filed with his appeal a “Motion For Late Acceptance of Untimely Filed Notice of Appeal.” The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the respondent’s filings.
 
The respondent urges the Board to accept the appeal out of time. The respondent claims that he thought former counsel would file the appeal for him, but the attorney failed to do so. However, the respondent has failed to meet any of the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Most critically, the respondent must show prejudice resulting from his attorney’s actions. Matter of Assaad, supra, at 556, 561-62; Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638; Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226 (9th Cir. 2002); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
The Immigration Judge found the respondent to be ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229b(b)(1). The Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal, as he was convicted of an offense under section 212(a)(2) of the Act. See section 240A(b)(1)(C) of the Act. Specifically, the respondent was convicted on April 27, 2001, of possession for sale of marijuana, with the sentence suspended. See section 101(a)(48)(B) of the Act (term of imprisonment refers to the period of incarceration imposed by court regardless of a partial or total suspension thereof).
 
The respondent admitted to his crime at the removal hearing, and admitted that it made him ineligible for relief (Tr. at 17). The respondent states that he is seeking to have his conviction vacated. However, we have found that the filing of a post-conviction motion or other form of collateral attack does not affect the finality of convictions for immigration purposes, unless and until the conviction has been overturned pursuant to such a motion. See Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750, 752 (BIA 1993).
 
*2 The respondent is therefore ineligible for relief. We therefore find that the appeal is untimely. The Immigration Judge’s decision is now final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.52, 1240.53, and 1241.31 (1999).

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: ATANAS APOSTOLOV GENOV
File: AXX XX2 516 - Chicago
June 15, 2004
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mary L. Sfasciotti, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joseph M. Yeung
Assistant District Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case is presently before us pursuant to the April 8, 2004, order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit granting the government’s motion to remand. The government requested a remand solely with regard to this Board’s August 29, 2003, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The government motion noted that in denying reconsideration, we stated that the respondent had not supported his previously filed motion to reopen to seek suspension of deportation with the required application for relief. However, the respondent had in fact filed a suspension application before the Immigration Judge, on November 13, 1997. The government’s motion also states that on remand, the Board can decide as well whether or not to rule on the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent’s motion to reconsider will now be granted and the deportation proceedings will be reopened.
 
As indicated above, the respondent had previously filed the required application for suspension of deportation. The Immigration Judge denied that application on February 27, 1998. He found that the respondent satisfied the continuous physical presence requirement under the special suspension provisions of the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2193, 2196 (NACARA). He further found that the respondent was of good moral character, but he concluded that the respondent, who had then been in the United States for less than 8 years and had no qualifying relatives here, had not established the requisite extreme hardship for suspension.
 
Since the time of the 1998 hearing, the respondent has married his long-time girlfriend, a lawful permanent resident of the United States. She filed a visa petition on the respondent’s behalf on April 30, 2001. The respondent also has now lived here for over 14 years, more than twice the 7 years required for suspension of deportation. He has accumulated significant assets here, and apparently has been employed and a productive, hard-working member of society. Under these circumstances, we find that the respondent should have his proceedings reopened for further consideration of his application for suspension.
 
We further find that the respondent’s second motion to reopen is not number barred because he has shown ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see generally Chowdhury v. Ashcroft, 241 F.3d 848 (7th Cir. 2001). We note that the respondent and his present counsel have presented detailed affidavits regarding their unsuccessful efforts to contact the respondent’s prior counsel, and have otherwise complied with the Lozada requirements. Further, prior counsel’s advice that the respondent not marry his permanent resident girlfriend, and his failure to support the respondent’s first motion to reopen with the required documents, or to timely inform the respondent of the Board’s November 7, 2002, decision denying reopening, constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Under all these circumstances, we find that respondent’s deportation proceedings should be reopened. Accordingly, the decisions of the Board dated August 29, 2003, and May 16, 2003, are vacated, and the motion to reconsider is granted. Upon reconsideration, the deportation proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for a further hearing.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eduardo Soto, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent is appealing the Immigration Judge’s written decision dated March 19, 2003, in which he denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his deportation proceedings. The respondent had previously been ordered deported to Guatemala in absentia on February 1, 1995. The respondent has not filed a brief in support of his appeal even though he indicated on his Notice of Appeal, Form EOIR-26, that a brief would be forthcoming. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not filed an appeal brief.
 
We affirm and adopt the Immigration Judge’s decision and with the following comments we will dismiss the respondent’s appeal. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
The respondent asserts that he complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his former attorney, Mr. Carlos Alberto Rodriguez. The respondent further argues that the fact he waited approximately 7 years to advance an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in conjunction with a motion to reopen should not cause doubt to be cast upon his allegation. See Notice of Appeal, Form EOIR-26.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly implied that merely complying with the procedural requirements set forth in Lozada does not establish that an alien’s prior counsel was ineffective. It does not appear that the procedural requirements of Lozada have even been met in this case as there is little information from the respondent himself in his motion which can be fairly read to set forth “in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel.” Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. The respondent has alleged only that his prior counsel informed him of an incorrect time to appear before the Immigration Court. See The Florida Bar Inquiry/Complaint Form.
 
In any event, even if the respondent were deemed to have complied with the Lozada procedural requirements, he still must establish that his prior counsel’s representation was, in fact, ineffective, and that such ineffectiveness caused him prejudice. Id. at 640. There is no explanation as to how the respondent recalls why exactly he failed to appear for his hearing so many years after such events transpired. Nor is there any reasonable explanation provided why the respondent waited so long to file his motion as he has been aware of his in absentia deportation order for several years. We agree with the Immigration Judge that this diminishes the reasonableness of his assertion.
 
*2 Indeed, the respondent previously filed a motion to reopen with the assistance of his prior counsel, and the respondent claimed at that time that he failed to appear for the hearing because he was “confused” as to the location of his hearing. See Motion to Reopen (received February 2, 1995).1 Thus, the respondent’s assertion why he failed to appear has shifted over the years and his belated claim of ineffective of assistance of counsel is unconvincing. Moreover, it does not appear that Mr. Rodriguez, his prior counsel, was necessarily ineffective as he had successfully obtained a motion for a continuance on the respondent’s behalf, appeared at the hearing for which the respondent failed to appear, and then filed a motion to reopen on his behalf.
 
Accordingly, in light of the foregoing discussion, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: AI ZHENG CHEN A.K.A. OY KOON CHAN
File: AXX XX4 595 - New York City
June 3, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael A.O. Brown, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s February 3, 2003, decision denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be sustained. The record will be remanded.
 
On October 8, 1999, the respondent failed to appear for his removal hearing, and was ordered removed in absentia. A motion to reopen was filed on February 11, 2000, asserting that he was late for his hearing because he was waiting for his attorney, who was engaged in a telephonic master calendar. He and his attorney eventually appeared for the hearing 90 minutes late, and after an in absentia order of removal had been entered by the Immigration Judge. On June 8, 2000, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s February 11, 2000, motion to reopen, concluding that no exceptional circumstances were present. The respondent appealed, and this Board dismissed the appeal on February 11, 2002.
 
On January 22, 2003, the respondent made a new motion to reopen, asserting that he had recently discovered that his former attorney had ineffectively represented him, and requesting that proceedings be reopened. He argued that not only was he victimized by his attorney’s negligence on his hearing day, but that his counsel committed additional negligence in the manner in which he pursued reopening the respondent’s case. He further noted in that motion that his former attorney had lost his license to practice law. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding that it was untimely.
 
Upon our review of the record, we find that the respondent’s motion is both time and numerically barred from consideration. See Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998); Matter of A-A, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998) (holding that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day statutory limit for the filing of a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia order of deportation under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act on the basis of exceptional circumstances). Although the Second Circuit, in which this case arises, has recognized the doctrine of “equitable tolling” in cases involving ineffective assistance of counsel, it has done so only when an alien has demonstrated that his or her constitutional right to due process was violated by the conduct of counsel, and when the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000) (concluding that the alien failed to demonstrate due diligence and thus, the doctrine of equitable tolling did not apply).
 
In the instant case, we have reviewed the documents submitted with the instant motion and find that the respondent may have been the victim of negligence. We further note that the respondent has attempted to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988, aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). However, the respondent must also demonstrate that he has suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Furthermore, he must demonstrate that he exercised due diligence in accordance with Iavorski v. INS, supra, before he can establish that equitable tolling of the statute of limitations is appropriate. Accordingly, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge to permit the Immigration Judge to determine whether the respondent has demonstrated that he exercised due diligence in accordance with Second Circuit law, and whether his constitutional right to due process was violated by the conduct of his counsel. Only then does the determination of compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, and Matter of Assaad, supra, become necessary.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained and his motion to reopen is granted. The record is remanded for proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anne D. Monahan, Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Allen Reid Tilson
Assistant District Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. These proceedings were last before us on February 18, 2004, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent now moves to reopen and reconsider these proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion is denied.
 
At the respondent’s hearing, the Immigration Judge pretermitted the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal when the respondent failed to file his fingerprints as required. The respondent has claimed that his representative failed to inform him in a timely manner of his obligation to file fingerprints for his application for cancellation. The respondent’s second attorney appealed the decision but did not address the ineffective assistance of counsel issues. The respondent’s third attorney has addressed ineffectiveness of counsel, but has failed to file sufficient documentation to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). For example, the respondent, now represented by his third attorney, has not stated whether a complaint was filed with the disciplinary authorities. Second, we see no evidence beyond statements of the third attorney,1 that the respondent informed the first attorney of his complaint. Also, the respondent has submitted a statement which contradicts in part his testimony about whether or not he was told to get his fingerprints taken; it also does not indicate how he was prejudiced. The respondent has not claimed that he was told a falsehood. Cf. Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996).
 
We further find that the respondent did not establish that he is prima facie eligible for the relief he seeks. His conviction for committing domestic violence and several convictions for driving while intoxicated may support a finding that the respondent is not eligible in the exercise of discretion. Finally, we note that the respondent was informed of the necessity of departing the United States under the Immigration Judge’s order granting voluntary departure, since failing to leave would result in the denial of a number of kinds of relief. The respondent did not leave. The filing of a motion does not toll the voluntary departure period. Matter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Pro se1
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal will be dismissed.2 The record reflects that the respondents waived appeal. The summary of the Immigration Judge’s oral decision for each respondent dated January 31, 2000, reflects that they waived appeal. The transcript page 56, line 20, also reflects that the respondents’ waived appeal. However, on August 25, 2000, the respondents attempted to file a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26), which was rejected for lack of proof of service. The respondents each resubmitted the Notice of Appeal and argued that their prior counsel did not advise them of the consequences of accepting a grant of voluntary departure in lieu of removal.
 
Upon review, the Board concludes that the respondents’ decision to waive appeal was knowingly and intelligently made. The record reveals that Immigration Judge discussed the requirements and consequences of voluntary departure prior to the completion of proceedings pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a) (Tr. at 50-54). The Immigration Judge briefly continued proceedings while the respondents’ counsel discussed the issue of voluntary departure prior to their waiver of appeal (Tr. at 53). The Board is satisfied that the waiver of appeal was expressly made by the respondents. Thus, the Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondents’ waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993).
 
In addition, the Board notes that the respondents attempted to make a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the respondents have not complied with any of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada,19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Moreover, as noted above, review of the record reveals that counsel discussed voluntary departure with his clients. The record before the Board simply does not support a finding that the respondents received ineffective assistance of counsel before the Immigration Judge.
 
Accordingly, for these reasons, the appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicolas A. Olano, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s May 5, 2003, decision denying her motion to reopen removal proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on November 26, 2002. The request for oral argument is denied. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent failed to establish “exceptional circumstances” for her failure to appear at her scheduled removal hearing on November 26, 2002, such that rescission of the in absentia order was warranted. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act. This Board has held that an order of deportation may be rescinded where the alien properly establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel which amounts to “exceptional circumstances” within the meaning of the Act. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (B1A 1996); see also Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The respondent in this case failed to appear at her hearing because she sought advice from an immigration consultant, Mr. James Cook, upon receiving the notice of hearing. Mr. Cook apparently had been assisting her with the visa petition her United States citizen husband wished to file on her behalf, and she contends that he advised her to write a letter to the Immigration Court instead of appearing for the hearing. Unlike the cases cited by the respondent in support of her motion, where courts have found that the time limits for filing a motion to reopen may be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance of counsel when aliens are defrauded by persons claiming to be attorneys, the respondent has never claimed that Mr. Cook represented himself to be an attorney. Under these circumstances, it was unreasonable for her to disregard the hearing notice, relying instead on the advice of a person who was not, and did not represent himself to be, an attorney. Compare Singh-Bhathal v. INS, 170 F.3d 943, 946-47 (9th Cir. 1999), with Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000), and Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). For this reason, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear at the scheduled hearing. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and Citizen of Egypt, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s March 28, 2003, denial of his motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the appeal and the motion to reopen. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded.
 
The respondent claims that he failed to appear at his master calendar hearing on March 14, 2003, because his attorney’s office called him on March 13, 2003, and told him that the hearing had been cancelled due to a scheduling conflict. Respondent’s letter to the Immigration Judge, 3/26/03 (“First Letter”); Respondent’s Affidavit. When the respondent received the in absentia order, he called the court and was told by the clerk to write a letter to the judge with an explanation. The respondent did so, and the Immigration Judge treated the letter as a motion to reopen. On March 28, 2003, the motion was denied. On April 4, 2003, the respondent timely appealed.
 
In addition to his appeal, the respondent filed a second letter with the Immigration Court, explaining that his first letter was not meant to be a motion to reopen and that he had not otherwise filed a motion to reopen. The letter states that “¿the first letterº was not by any means a motion to reopen my proceeding, especially that I know that there are some rules that must be followed before I can file a motion to reopen my case.” Respondent’s letter to the Immigration Judge, April 7, 2003 (“Second Letter”). The Immigration Judge did not respond to the respondent’s second letter.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should not have considered his first letter to be a motion to reopen, especially in light of his second letter which explicitly stated that his first letter was not a motion to reopen. We agree.
 
While it was reasonable for the Immigration Judge to the treat the respondent’s first letter as a motion to reopen, his second letter should have been treated as a motion to reconsider due to the alleged error of fact that his first letter was not a motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2) (2003) (stating that “¿aº motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s prior decision ….”). Upon reconsideration, the Immigration Judge should have vacated the motion denial since the respondent had not intended the first letter to be a motion. Absent such action, the respondent was barred from filing a proper motion to rescind. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(4)(ii) (allowing an alien ordered removed in absentia in removal proceedings to file only one motion to reopen).
 
*2 Based on the foregoing, we find it appropriate to remand this case to the Immigration Judge to consider the respondent’s appeal papers as his motion to rescind pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(4)(ii). On remand, the Immigration Judge should consider the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which is supported by the appropriate documentation,1 as an exceptional circumstance for his failure to appeal. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinon.

A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In addition, an alien is not required to show prejudice in order to rescind an order of deportation entered following a hearing conducted in absentia under section 242B(c)(3) of the Act.

*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (both respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
In a decision dated April 3, 2003, an Immigration Judge denied the respondents’ motion to reopen alleging that their application for cancellation of removal, previously deemed abandoned by the Immigration Judge on March 5, 2003, had not been timely filed due to a calendaring error by the respondents’ former counsel. The Immigration Judge found that the respondents had failed to meet the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988),1 and, therefore, denied the motion.
 
Pursuant to precedent established by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the procedural requirements established under Matter of Lozada need not be met where “counsel’s ineffective assistance was obvious and undisputed on the face of the record.” Reyes v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1126, 1130 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000)). In the respondents’ motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, which includes a declaration from one of the attorneys handling the respondents’ case, it is clear that the failure to file a timely application for relief was the fault of counsel. The declaration states that the attorney had taken over calendaring for the law firm but due to unfamiliarity with the system, missed the deadline for filing the application for cancellation of removal. As the respondents appear prima facie eligible for the relief they seek, we find their attorney’s failure to file a timely application caused clear prejudice to the respondents and, therefore, will reverse the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003) (“¿p ºrejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” (quoting Castillo-Perez, supra at 527 n.12 (quoting Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999)))).
 
*2 ORDER: The respondents’ appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondents’ motion to reopen is vacated and the record of proceedings is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Claude H. Kleefield, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
On appeal the respondent contends that the Immigration Court failed to take judicial notice of her name change to “Alvarez” based on her marriage to Jose Alavarez, and therefore neither she nor her attorney appeared because they did not receive a notice of hearing under the respondent’s correct name of “Fatima Alvarez.”
 
The Order to Show Cause was personally served on the respondent under her former married name of Fatima Matos. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent deported in absentia on June 1, 1993, and on September 13, 1993, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the proceedings. The respondent did not appeal that decision. On June 3, 2002, the respondent filed a motion to reopen seeking to apply for adjustment of status based on her marriage to a United States citizen. The record reflects that the notice of hearing regarding the motion to reopen was sent by certified mail to the respondent’s attorney, Claude H. Kleefield, Esquire, on August 13, 2002, and was received by her attorney on August 15, 2002. As the respondent’s attorney received notice of the hearing, proper notice was provided to the respondent. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). Neither the respondent nor her attorney appeared for the hearing on August 23, 2002, and the respondent was ordered deported in absentia.
 
The respondent’s argument on appeal that she and her attorney failed to appear for the hearing because the notice of hearing was not under the respondent’s newly married name of “Fatima Alvarez” is without merit. Both the certified mail notice and the hearing notice sent to the respondent’s attorney clearly set forth the respondent’s alien registration number. Furthermore, on appeal the respondent states that “the previous motion to re-open which was granted referred to ALVAREZ in all the documents.” However, the previous motion to reopen was not granted by the Immigration Judge. Rather, the Immigration Judge scheduled a hearing on the motion to reopen only. See I.J. Dec. dated August 23, 2002 (stating that the “respondent and her attorney failed to appear at the motion hearing on August 23, 2002”).
 
*2 Finally, we note that the respondent has not made a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Laurence B. Donoghue, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julie C. Chimarusti,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on January 14, 2004, when we affirmed, without opinion, the results of an Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable as charged, ineligible for relief, and ordering him removed from the United States to Belize. In a motion filed on February 25, 2004, the respondent requests that we reopen proceedings to permit him to apply for relief under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the respondent’s motion. The respondent’s motion is denied, and his request for a stay of removal pending adjudication of this motion is denied as moot.
 
In his motion, the respondent contends that his prior counsel incorrectly advised him that he was ineligible for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act. To the extent the respondent is raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his prior attorney, he has not even attempted to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). See also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9 th Cir. 2000); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000). Moreover, the respondent in his motion has not established that he is in fact eligible for section 212(c) relief. In INS v. St. Cyr, 121 S.Ct 2271 (2001), the Supreme Court held that the restrictions on section 212(c) relief do not apply retroactively to an alien who pled guilty prior to April 24, 1996. The record in this case establishes that the respondent pled guilty on July 29, 1996, for the offense of possession for sale of cocaine base. In addition, the record reflects that the respondent was convicted for the offense of possession of a narcotic controlled substance on April 6, 1998. As these convictions were post-AEDPA, the respondent is ineligible for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act under INS v. St. Cyr, supra.
 
In his motion, the respondent also contends that if he had received a speedy criminal trial with respect to his 1996 conviction and been given the opportunity to enter a plea in a timely manner, he would now be eligible for section 212(c) relief. The record establishes that the respondent pled guilty on July 29, 1996, for the offense of possession for sale of cocaine base, and that the offense was committed in March of 1994. However, this Board does not have jurisdiction in these proceedings to consider the respondent’s constitutional or due process challenges to his criminal proceedings. The respondent was convicted for immigration purposes on July 29, 1996, when he entered his guilty plea. Moreover, even if the respondent’s guilty plea had been entered prior to AEDPA, as set forth above, the respondent is ineligible for section 212(c) relief due to his 1998 possession conviction.
 
*2 Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen to apply for relief under section 212(c) of the Act will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mariela Caravetta, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. On November 16, 2001, following the respondent’s failure to appear, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed to Mexico. On June 20, 2002, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on August 14, 2002. On August 26, 2002, the respondent appealed from that decision, and on August 14, 2003, the Board affirmed the decision of the of the Immigration Judge. On September 3, 2003, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and reconsider with the Board. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not opposed the motion. The motion will be granted.
 
With her motion, the respondent has provided evidence that the Notice to Appear was mailed to a slightly incorrect address, and evidence that DHS had mailed other correspondence to the respondent’s correct address. In the motion, the respondent again argues that exceptional circumstances exist due to a medical disability. In addition, the respondent argues that she did not timely file her motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge because of the ineffective assistance of counsel, and that she is entitled to the tolling of the time limit to file a motion to reopen and a waiver of the numerical limitation for a motion to reopen because she was the victim of fraud and the ineffective assistance of counsel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent also argues that she is eligible for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c).
 
Upon consideration, we find it appropriate to waive the numerical limitations on motions to reopen. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000). Furthermore, we find that the respondent has substantially complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st. Cir. 1988), and has shown prejudice. See Rodrigues-Lariz, supra; Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). Therefore, in light of the evidence that the Notice to Appear was mailed to a slightly incorrect address and the holdings of the Ninth Circuit listed in this decision, we find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for consideration of relief under section 212(c) of the Act and any other form of relief form removal for which she is currently eligible.
 
*2 Accordingly, the unopposed motion is granted and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

March 16, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Jasmine C. Coca, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 19, 2002. On appeal, the respondents allege they have received ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
However, the respondents have failed to fulfil the prerequisites for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondents have failed to attach to the appeal a sworn affidavit, signed by the respondents, setting out the alleged facts necessary to show a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
This affidavit should have included the factual allegations underlying the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.1 The sworn affidavit should have also included the contractual agreement with the former counsel. The sworn affidavit should have also indicated that the respondents have notified the former counsel of the allegation of ineffective assistance, enabling the former counsel to respond to the allegations. In addition, the sworn affidavit should have indicated that a complaint has been filed against the former counsel with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. See Matter of Grijalva, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
We also note that the respondents have failed to identify how counsel’s action or inaction negatively affected the outcome of the respondents’ case. The respondents have failed to show that they would not be removable or would be eligible for relief but for the attorney’s action or inaction. See Matter of Assaad, supra. Consequently, the respondent has failed to show a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondents are permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the aliens fail to so depart, the aliens shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondents fail to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the respondents shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

Because the factual statements in the brief are not sworn to be true, they are not evidence. Motions or briefs, containing legal argument, must be accompanied by a sworn statement of a person having personal knowledge of the facts alleged.

IN RE: RACHAEL EFURU ONUMONU
File: AXX XX5 742 - Philadelphia
March 15, 2004
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has requested reopening of proceedings before the Board of Immigration Appeals. We have jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. The motion is denied.
 
We note that section 1003.2(c)(2) of 8 Code of Federal Regulations provides that
except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings (whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge) and that motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later.
 
 
The record reflects that the instant motion to reopen was filed with the Board on July 31, 2003. Because the respondent’s motion was filed more than 90 days after the date in which the final administrative decision by the Board was rendered, it is untimely and is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). We have also determined that the exceptions to these filing requirements set forth in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3) are inapplicable.
 
In her motion, the respondent also claims ineffective assistance of counsel. In the immigration area, there is a three-step procedure for filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The respondent is required to: (1) set forth the relevant facts in an affidavit; (2) demonstrate that she has informed counsel of her allegations and provided such counsel with an opportunity to respond; and (3) show that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, in cases where counsel allegedly violated his ethical or legal responsibilities. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). In addition to complying with the procedural requirements, a respondent must also show that, “he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance.” Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638.
 
We find that the respondent here has not complied with the mandates of Lozada and its progeny. The record reflects that she has not complied with the second and third procedural requirements as set out above. In addition, the respondent has failed to show that she was prejudiced by her representative’s performance. As the respondent has failed to satisfy all of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim set out in Matter of Lozada, supra, she has not made out a case for reopening. We further find that as the “new evidence” which the respondent seeks to have considered would not change the result, reopening is not warranted. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on October 30, 2003, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s application for relief under the Convention Against Torture and finding the respondent ineligible for other relief from deportation for having been convicted of an aggravated felony considered to be a particularly serious crime. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen which will be denied.
 
Pursuant to regulation, a motion to reopen “shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.…” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (2003). In his motion to reopen, the respondent asserts that he has new and material evidence regarding his mental illness (bipolar disorder) which will result in torture if he is returned to Iran, as well as additional evidence supporting his previously made arguments that he will be tortured because he has renounced the Muslim faith, his length of stay in the United States, and his criminal history. The respondent argues that while all of this evidence was previously available, his former counsel failed to present it and, therefore, his case should be reopened due to ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, the respondent asserts that he has met the procedural requirements for reopening under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).1 See also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
Although the respondent has met the general requirements for reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel, we do not find that he has established that he was prejudiced by his previous counsel. It is clear from the record that the respondent’s counsel asked to withdraw his representation and that the Department of Homeland Security opposed that motion (Tr. at 4-6). The Immigration Judge, however, granted the motion to withdraw because the respondent himself requested that his attorney be dismissed and that he be allowed to represent himself, despite knowing that the Immigration Judge intended to go forward with the hearing (Tr. at 9). Therefore, he can not now claim that his own failure to raise the issue of mental health as a possible basis to find that he will be tortured constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Moreover, the respondent’s former attorney has responded to the respondent’s bar complaint and indicated that he felt the documentary evidence submitted was sufficient, that the respondent’s mental health claim was novel but not necessarily one which would prevail, and that he felt that the key with regard to the respondent’s other claims lay in testimony. The fact that the respondent is now dissatisfied with his former counsel’s strategy in pursuing relief, when the respondent ultimately represented himself, is not grounds for reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

A motion to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not.

File: AXX XX2 240 - Los Angeles
March 12, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alma Rosa Nieto, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal under 240A(b)
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 19, 2002. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had failed to submit her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act within the time prescribed by the Immigration Judge and granted the respondent voluntary departure. On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in pretermitting her application for cancellation of removal and requests a remand to the Immigration Judge to properly consider her application for cancellation of removal. The respondent also asserts that her former attorney provided ineffective assistance in failing to file her application for cancellation of removal in a timely manner. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
During the respondent’s May 11, 2001, hearing, the Immigration Judge instructed the respondent that her application for cancellation of removal must be filed by September 30, 2002, in order to be considered by the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 3). However, the respondent failed to submit her application prior to the deadline established by the Immigration Judge. As a result of the respondent’s failure to timely file her application for cancellation of removal, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent waived her right to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act. See I.J. at 2.
 
All documents and applications that are to be considered in a proceeding before an Immigration Judge must be filed with the Immigration Court having administrative control over the record of proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(a). The Immigration Judge has the authority to set deadlines for the submission of applications. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). If an application is not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application shall be deemed waived. See id; Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547 (BIA 1992). We find that the Immigration Judge properly pretermitted the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal, as the respondent failed to comply with the deadline set by the Immigration Judge to submit her application to the Immigration Court.
 
The respondent maintains that her failure to timely file her application for cancellation of removal is a result of the ineffective assistance of her former counsel. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Matter of Lozada, supra, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. However, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that an alien need not fulfill all the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, to assert claim of ineffective assistance of counsel when the record reflects a clear and obvious case of such. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that attorney’s failure to timely file a suspension of deportation application was negligence); see also Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 In addition to the three procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, it is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair: See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
In this matter, while the respondent has submitted an affidavit and provided evidence that her former attorney has been suspended by the California State Bar, the respondent has failed to establish that she was prejudiced as a result of her former attorney’s ineffectiveness. The respondent seeks cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act. However, we find that the respondent has failed to establish prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal. The respondent has failed to submit a completed application for cancellation of removal or the necessary documentation to establish the requisite continuous physical presence, good moral character, or exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to so depart, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Friedman, John D., Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeffery Finegan,
Assistant District Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated November 10, 2003. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998). See also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that attorney’s failure to timely file a suspension of deportation application was negligence). See also Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
In the instant case, the respondent has not satisfied the procedural requirements above. He has also not shown that prior counsel neglected to present any evidence or argument to the Immigration Judge or the Board which may have changed the earlier decisions rendered in this case. Furthermore, the fact that prior counsel may have neglected to inform the respondent of his right to seek review of the Board’s earlier decision with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is not a reason for the Board to reopen. The respondent needs to raise the issue of the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit with the Ninth Circuit and not the Board. Finally, the respondent’s motion is barred by section 240B(d) of the Act even with the 30-day extension received from the DHS.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rosalba Pina, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(5)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(5)(A)(i)º - No valid labor certification
Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This record was last before us on August 8, 2002, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s May 25, 2000, decision to deny the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen his proceedings.
 
The respondent asserts in his motion that his proceedings should be reopened because he was denied ineffective assistance of counsel during his proceedings before the Immigration Court and on appeal. Our review of allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are governed by our analysis in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Matter of Lozada, we stated that a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement between the respondent and his legal representative and what actions were to be taken on his behalf, (2) that the counsel whose reputation is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) an indication of whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not.
 
We find that the respondent has complied with the above-described requirements. In addition, we acknowledge that his prior counsel, Mr. Gary Matthew Spraker, has been suspended from the practice of law before the Department of Homeland Security, the Immigration Courts, and this Board. We further find that the respondent has adequately established that he was not represented effectively by his prior counsel. Thus, we find that the respondent’s proceedings should be reopened so that he may have a further opportunity to pursue his application for relief from removal before the Immigration Court.1
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kenneth Panzer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anthony E. Maingot
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The record is remanded.
 
The record reflects that on August 25, 2003, the respondent appeared before an Immigration Judge, conceded removability, and requested an opportunity for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The respondent was then instructed to file his application (Form I-191) with the Immigration Court no later than September 8, 2003. The application was not filed by the deadline, and on September 26, 2003, the Immigration Judge determined that the request for section 212(c) relief was abandoned. Specifically, the Immigration Judge noted that “the respondent failed to timely submit his application for relief and failed to request an extension” (I.J. at 1-2). The Immigration Judge further noted that the respondent requested that the court accept his untimely application after the deadline for submission had already passed (I.J. at 2). Finally, the Immigration Judge observed that the court “admonished the respondent and his ¿ formerº attorney of the consequences of not timely filing his application” (I.J. at 2).
 
On October 29, 2003, the respondent appealed the Immigration Judge’s above-referenced decision. On January 4, 2004, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a motion to remand asserting ineffective assistance of counsel. Subsequently, the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration of Naturalization Service) filed an opposition to the respondent’s motion. On February 9, 2004, the respondent filed a response to the DHS’ opposition.
 
We will first address whether the respondent’s application for a section 212(c) waiver of inadmissibility was properly found to have been abandoned on September 8, 2003. We note that documents and applications that are to be considered in a proceeding before an Immigration Judge must be filed with the Immigration Court having administrative control over the record of proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(a). In addition, the Immigration Judge may set and extend time limits for the filing of applications and related documents and responses thereto, if any. If an application is not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application shall be deemed waived. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c); Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547 (BIA 1992). Based on the foregoing, we find that the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent abandoned his application for a section 212(c) waiver of inadmissibility by not filing it in a timely manner. Matter of R-R-, supra.
 
*2 We will now address whether the failure of the respondent to timely file his section 212(c) application was on account of attorney negligence. We note that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640; see also Matter of Aassad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 561 (BIA 2003).
 
We have reviewed the record and note that the respondent has satisfied the requirements set forth above. We further note that the record reflects the following. The respondent was a lawful permanent resident of the United States since 1988, and had no other relief from removal available. The respondent’s former attorney was given 2 weeks to file the section 212(c) application with the Immigration Court, but neglected to do so. Nowhere in the respondent’s former attorney’s correspondence is there any suitable explanation for why the application was not timely filed. As noted by the respondent, his former attorney vaguely explained that exceptional circumstances prevented him from timely filing the respondent’s 212(c) application (Respondent’s Affidavit at 4; Respondent’s Motion for Leave of Court at 1). We further note that the respondent’s former attorney indicated that his untimely filing of the respondent’s 212(c) application was “through no fault of the respondent” (Respondent’s Motion for Leave of Court at 1; Respondent’s Affidavit at 4). As a result of the respondent’s former attorney’s negligence, the respondent’s only opportunity to obtain a waiver of his inadmissibility was lost.
 
We find that the respondent has established that his failure to file his section 212(c) application by the date required was as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Lozada, supra; Matter of Aassad, supra. Accordingly, the record is remanded to allow the respondent an opportunity for section 212(c) consideration.

MOTION

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Monica M. Little
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, moves the Board to reopen proceedings so that he may apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”). The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia on October 15, 1998, and denied the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen on August 25, 2000. We affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen on June 19, 2001. The respondent filed the instant motion to reopen with the Board on September 22, 2003, in which he argues that his in absentia order of removal should be rescinded and the untimely motion should be granted because of exceptional circumstances and equitable tolling due to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 3-5. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the respondent’s motion to reopen. See DHS Opposition to Motion to Reopen. The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent failed to file his current motion to reopen within 180 days of the Board’s June 19, 2001, decision as required by section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3) and 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Furthermore, we also find that the 180-day statute of limitation in the respondent’s case is not equitably tolled, under Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999), because he failed to demonstrate that this motion was untimely as a result of deceptive actions by a notary posing as an attorney. See Lopez v. INS, supra. Additionally, we note that although the respondent claims that he failed to appear before the Immigration Judge because of a notary’s ineffective assistance of counsel, he failed to meet the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) and failed to include an application for cancellation of removal or any other relief with any of his motions to reopen. See Lopez v. INS, supra, at 1099-1101.
 
Accordingly, in light of the foregoing discussion, the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Natalie S. Tynan, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on December 24, 2003. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on June 20, 2002. The motion has been filed out of time and will be denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion.
 
The respondent claims in her motion that prior counsel was incompetent, because prior counsel failed to file a brief with this Board, which caused us to dismiss her appeal without opinion. There is, however, no basis for abrogating the motions deadline here. Any equitable tolling of the motions deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence on her own behalf. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 127, 134-35. (2nd Cir. 2000). The pending motion was filed over a year late. The respondent has been represented by current counsel by no later than April, 2003 - when counsel filed a motion to withdraw a previous motion to reopen filed by the respondent. Current counsel received a copy of the respondent’s file in July, 2003 (Respondent’s Mot., at p. 5). Nevertheless, the respondent did not submit a complaint against former counsel with New York authorities until September, 2003, and did not file the pending motion until December 24, 2003. Id.
 
For claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108, 110 (2d Cir. 1993). The respondent claims that we should excuse the lateness of the motion, because she was awaiting a response from former counsel to her complaints (Respondent’s Mot., at p. 7). Yet Matter of Lozada does not require that a respondent delay filing a motion for that reason. Moreover, as noted, the respondent delayed filing her complaint against former counsel until months after engaging current counsel. Moreover, she waited over a month after filing her “rebuttal response” with the New York authorities to file the pending motion. Id. There is no basis for abrogating the motions deadline here. The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Monica M. Little
Assistant District Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 This matter was last before this Board on July 31, 1998, when we denied as untimely the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The respondent1 now files a motion to reopen and remand asserting ineffective assistance of counsel and changed country conditions. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) filed an opposition to the respondent’s motion. The respondent’s motion will be granted.
 
The respondent is a male native and citizen of Pakistan. In his motion to reopen, the respondent alleges that his former attorney prejudiced him, thus warranting the reopening of his case. Amongst other things, the respondent charges that his former attorney sent an ill prepared attorney who the respondent never met before to represent the respondent at his merits hearing. Additionally, the respondent asserts that his former attorney abandoned him and failed to timely file the respondent’s appeal. The respondent submitted an article indicating that the California Bar Association suspended the respondent’s former attorney from the practice of law for, inter alia, “engag ¿ ingº in a course of practicing law that was reckless and involved gross negligence” (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen and Remand; Tab B). The respondent argues that he was further prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of a paralegal.
 
While we offer no opinion as to the merits of the respondent’s applications for relief, we recognize that the respondent’s appeal proffers a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (noting several required steps which should be taken to successfully prove a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel). See Respondent’s Motion and Respondent’s Motion to Accept Supplemental Filing. Furthermore, regardless of the specific Lozada requirements, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this matter arises, has held that where the record shows a “clear and obvious” case of ineffective assistance of counsel, the requirements of Lozada need not be “rigidly enforced.” See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F. 3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (stating that “Lozada is intended to ensure both that an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one”). See also Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000) (noting that the Lozada requirements are reasonable but “not dispositive,” depending on the circumstances of each case).
 
*2 The record supports the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, we find it appropriate to reopen these proceedings and remand this matter to afford the respondent a full and fair hearing on the merits.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before the Board on August 26, 2003, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal as untimely and returned the record to the Immigration Court without further action. The respondent subsequently filed a motion to reopen proceedings with this Board on October 6, 2003. The Department of Homeland Security (“the DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent’s attorney, who is the same attorney who failed to file a timely appeal, argues that a member of his staff mailed the Notice of Appeal to the incorrect address and, thus, the motion to reopen should be granted due to ineffective assistance of counsel. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel require that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. See Matter of Assad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), cf. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10(1st. Cir. 1988).
 
The respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Id. The respondent has failed to submit an affidavit and has offered no reason why he could not have filed an appropriate affidavit. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 2004 WL 253539 (9th Cir. 2004) (ineffective assistance of counsel claim denied where alien: failed to file affidavit; failed to offer any reason why he could not have filed an appropriate affidavit; and, he failed to provide notice of the claim to counsel); see also Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 938 (9th Cir. 2003)(court found ineffective assistance of counsel where both aliens and counsel filed affidavits). While respondent’s counsel appears to be on notice of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim since he conceded in the motion that the appeal was not timely filed, counsel has not submitted an affidavit attesting to the mistake. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 825 (9 th Cir. 2003)(court found alien complied with second prong of Lozada where counsel conceded his mistake in the motion and his accompanying declaration). Furthermore, the respondent has not provided any evidence that he has filed a State Bar complaint against counsel or provided any explanation as to why he has not filed a complaint. Accordingly, the respondent has failed to substantially comply with the requirements set forth in Lozada. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, supra at 824 (court has permitted ineffective assistance of counsel claims to go forward when there is substantial compliance with Lozada).
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record of proceeding is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.

IN RE: SASHI LATA SHARMA
File: A70 544 970 - San Francisco
March 5, 2004
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ashwani K. Bhakhri, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Grace H. Cheung
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board when in a decision dated January 8, 2004, we denied the respondent’s1 motion to reopen as numerically barred and untimely filed and rejected the respondent’s argument that we should accept her motion sua sponte, noting that the respondent had not shown exceptional circumstances sufficient to cause the Board to exercise the limited discretionary authority to overlook the time and number bar and reopen. See Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002) (citing Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997)). This case is now before the Board again based on a motion to reconsider our denial of her last motion to reopen. The motion is denied.
 
When deciding a motion to reconsider, the Board considers the case as though the decision in the case on the record before us had never been entered. If the respondent was eligible for relief at the time of the original decision, then in reconsidering the decision, we treat her status as that which it had been at the time of the initial decision. “The very nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard.” Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991). We have reviewed the record, as well as both the Immigration Judge’s and this Board’s prior decisions. We are not persuaded by the respondent’s contentions that our prior decision was either legally, or factually, erroneous. The respondent has failed to demonstrate that reconsideration is warranted on that basis.
 
Moreover, to the extent the respondent alleges ineffective assistance by former counsel, we are unpersuaded. We note that in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), we laid out the requirements that a respondent must meet in order to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See also Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997). Here, the respondent has failed to comply with any of the established requirements to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Moreover, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that she suffered prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra. We recognize that the present case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has held that rigid adherence to the procedural requirements established in Lozada is not always necessary. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir 2000). However, where the respondent has failed to comply with any of the Lozada requirements and where the respondent has also failed to show any prejudice, we are compelled to deny the motion to reopen. See Matter of Assaad, supra.
 
*2 Moreover, even if the respondent had persuaded us that she was unaware of the filing of the March 6, 1998, motion to reopen, she has not indicated how she pursued her rights diligently, or how she was prevented from filing her own motion to reopen after she received the November 23, 1998, “bag and baggage” letter, so as to allow for any consideration of “equitable tolling” of the statute. See Ituribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (in order for equitable tolling to apply, the invoking party must show that she was prevented from properly filing a motion to reopen because of fraud, deception, or error); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001) (in order for equitable tolling to apply, respondent needs to show that her ignorance was caused by circumstances beyond her control, and which go beyond a claim of excusable neglect.). The arguments contained in the respondent’s motion were previously considered, and rejected.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jason R. Grimm
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reconsider has been filed out of time and will be denied. The Board’s last order in these proceedings was entered on December 10, 2003. A motion to reconsider a decision of the Board must be filed within 30 days after the date of that decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). In the instant case, a motion to reconsider would have been due on or before January 9, 2004. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until January 15, 2004. The motion to reconsider was therefore filed out of time.
 
Respondent asserts that the Board’s order essentially summarily affirms the Immigration Judge’s opinion, and violates her due process rights because the Board has not explained its rationale for its ruling. A motion of this nature, however, is statutorily barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(b)(3). A summary affirmance without opinion concludes that any error in the immigration judge’s decision was harmless or immaterial; the immigration judge’s order provides the rationale, and thus the legitimacy, for the Board’s summary affirmance.
 
In her motion, the respondent has raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. In addition, the motion must establish prejudice arising from the alleged failings of prior counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent here has failed to meet these requirements.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David E. Piver, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent moves this Board to reopen our February 12, 2003, decision in which we summarily dismissed his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s October 2, 2002, decision. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”) (I.J. at 3-4). Furthermore, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act and adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act because the respondent did not possess an approved visa petition (I.J. at 3-4). In his motion to reopen, the respondent argues that his previous attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel because the attorney failed to notify him that his visa petition interview was scheduled for April 16, 2002, and failed to notify him of the Board’s February 12, 2003 decision. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 11-21. The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
We have held that in order to reopen proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel, a respondent must demonstrate that he or she was prejudiced by prior counsel’s conduct. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 640 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). In the instant case, the respondent has never possessed an approved visa petition and, therefore, remains ineligible for a section 212(h) waiver and adjustment of status. See Matter of Michel, 21 I&N Dec. 1101, 1103 (BIA 1998) (discussing the need for an approved visa petition when applying for a section 212(h) waiver and adjustment of status). Moreover, the respondent has failed to demonstrate in his motion to reopen that he is currently eligible for any relief from removal or that there was an error in the Immigration Judge’s decision. See Matter of Assaad, supra, at 562. We also note that the respondent had an opportunity on appeal to claim ineffective assistance of counsel relating to his visa petition and argue eligibility for a section 212(h) waiver, but failed to do so. See Respondent’s Notice of Appeal. For the aforementioned reasons, we find that the respondent failed to demonstrate prejudice stemming from his prior counsel’s conduct.
 
*2 Accordingly, in light of the foregoing discussion, the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

File: A31 171 726 - San Diego

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brian Figeroux, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alan S. Rabinowitz
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on March 26, 2001, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) had been abandoned and ordering him deported to Trinidad. On February 12, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and reconsider and a motion to stay his removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a response in opposition to the motion. The motion to reopen and reconsider is denied. The motion for a stay of removal is denied.
 
In his motions, the respondent seeks reopening of proceedings to apply for three forms of relief which he contends became available after the Immigration Judge ordered him deported on June 25, 1996: a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act, cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), and derivative United States citizenship.1 Specifically, he argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because former counsel failed to submit an application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act by the deadline set by the Immigration Judge. The respondent contends that under Ninth Circuit case law, he does not have to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel where the record clearly demonstrates that an attorney failed to meet the standard of competent representation. He additionally asserts that he can file a motion to reopen based upon new law or intervening circumstances that might change the result in a case, as in his case where there have been significant changes regarding section 212(c) waivers, including the statutory elimination of such relief for certain criminal aliens and the Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St. Cyr, 533, U.S. 289 (2001) (holding that section 212(c) waivers remain available to aliens who pled guilty prior to April 24, 1996) since the Board dismissed his appeal. He further claims to be eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, which form of relief did not come into existence until April 1, 1997.
 
*2 The respondent’s motion is untimely. Motions to reconsider must be filed within 30 days of the Board’s March 26, 2001, decision while motions to reopen must be filed within 90 days of that decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. The respondent’s motions were filed on February 12, 2004, a date well after the regulatory required deadlines. The respondent argues, however, that the intervening changes in law allow him to file motions outside of these deadlines. However, the most recent of the alleged intervening changes relied upon by the respondent took place on June 12, 2001, a date less than 90 days after our decision, and therefore within the time period for the filing of a motion to reopen, and over 2 1/2 years before the filing of the present motions.2 We are aware that the United States Court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in which jurisdiction the present case arises, has held that the time restrictions for the filing of motions before the Board are subject to equitable tolling where aliens act diligently. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001). Equitable tolling applies where aliens have acted diligently. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d at 897. We have addressed the issue of significant changes in law affecting relief for aliens. See Matter of X-G-W-, 22 I&N Dec. 71 (BIA 1998). However, as we observed in Matter of G-C-L-, the purpose of removing the time and number restrictions on motions filed due to intervening changes in law was to “afford individuals both a means to promptly respond to the change in law and a reasonable period of time in which to do so.” See Matter of G-C-L-, 23 I&N Dec. 359, 362 (BIA 2002). The respondent has not acted diligently in filing a motion to reopen on February 12, 2004, based upon intervening changes in law, the most recent of which occurred on June 12, 2001. We therefore find his motions to be untimely.
 
The respondent also contends, however, that his motions should be equitably tolled because he received ineffective assistance from his former counsel. He contends that he would have applied for a section 212(c) waiver by the deadline set by the Immigration Judge but for the ineffectiveness of his former counsel. The Ninth Circuit has held that the Lozada requirements should not be applied rigidly, particularly where the record establishes a clear and obvious ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 82 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002), and cases cited therein. The Ninth Circuit also has stated that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevent from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d at 897. See also Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, supra, and cases cited therein. We find that this record, however, does not shows clear and obvious ineffective assistance of counsel which resulted in prejudice to the respondent. The Board’s March 26, 2001, decision clearly indicated that we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the respondent had abandoned his section 212(c) application because he had not filed it by the deadline set by the Immigration Judge. Thus, the respondent knew upon receipt of our decision that his former attorney had not filed his application. The ineffectiveness of counsel was therefore apparent to the respondent at that time. Moreover, the Supreme Court issued its decision in INS v. St. Cyr, supra, only 2 1/2 months after we issued our decision. The respondent therefore could have filed a motion to reopen based upon former counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness within a reasonable period of time from the Supreme Court’s decision, if not within 90 days of either that decision or our decision. The respondent has not acted diligently by filing his motions over 2 1/2 years after the Supreme Court’s decision. For all of the above reasons, the respondent’s motions are denied as untimely.
 
*3 The respondent also argues that he has derived United States citizenship from his naturalized parents under section 320 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1431, as amended by the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-395, 114 Stat. 1631 (enacted Oct. 30, 2000, effective Feb. 27, 2001). We find that the respondent has not met his burden of establishing that he derived United States citizenship from his parents. First, he has not shown how any of the facts involved regarding his purported United States citizenship are new or previously unavailable or undiscoverable. Second, he provides no documentation to support his claim, such as his birth certificate, his parents’ marriage certificate, his parents’ naturalization certificates, his parents’ divorce decree, and any legal documentation regarding their separation and his custody. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) (motions to reopen must be accompanied by new or previously unavailable or undiscoverable evidence to support the relief requested). Third, the provisions of the Child Citizenship Act are not retroactive. See Hughes v. Ashcroft, 255 F.3d 752, 760 (9th Cir. 2001). As the respondent was over the age of 18 years upon the effective date of the Child Citizenship Act (February 27, 2001), its provisions are inapplicable to him and he must satisfy the citizenship requirements as in existence prior that amendment. The respondent does not contend that he has derived United States citizenship based upon the provisions former section 321 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1432, which provision applies to him. Nor do we find that he has provided evidence showing that either both of his parents naturalized prior to his attaining 18 years of age or that his parents were legally separated and that his mother had legal custody of him. See Barthelemy v. Ashcroft, 329 F.3d 1062, 1065 (9th Cir. 2003) (legal separation means a judicial decree affecting the marital relationship). Therefore, his motion to reopen based upon a claim of derivative United States citizenship must be denied.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motions are denied.

The respondent admits in his motions that he has been convicted of additional criminal offenses. See Resp. Mem. of Law is Support of Reopening at 2. He states that he was convicted on June 17, 1998, of sale of crack cocaine for which he was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment. Id. He also says that he was convicted on November 20, 2001, of resisting arrest, for which he was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment as a persistent felony offender. Id. The respondent states that he pled guilty to both of these offenses. Id.

The enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (enacted April 24, 1996) (“AEDPA”), which eliminated section 212(c) waivers of inadmissibility, is not an intervening change in law because it occurred prior to the respondent’s deadline for filing an application for section 212(c) relief and the Immigration Judge’s decision. There are only two relevant intervening changes in law occurring after the issuance of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The first is the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (enacted Sept. 30, 1996) (“IIRIRA”), which abolished exclusion and deportation proceedings and replaced them with the newly created removal proceedings. IIRIRA also created the relief of section 240A(a) cancellation of removal for criminal aliens in removal proceedings. The second is the Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St. Cyr, supra, which was rendered on June 12, 2001.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
VILLASUSO JR., RAUL
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated December 16, 2003. The respondent, by and through new counsel, has filed a motion to reopen to present previously unavailable evidence which supports his claim for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. A motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent has failed to demonstrate that the proffered evidence was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. For example, the motion is supported by the respondent’s daughter’s medical records dated 1996 through1998, long before the respondent’s January 6, 2003, removal hearing. The respondent admits that the evidence was previously available, but he claims that he only recently realized its significance. The respondent’s claim does not excuse his failure to present the evidence at his removal hearing. Furthermore, he was represented by counsel at the hearing and on appeal. He has not raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim either explicitly or implicitly. See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Inasmuch as the respondent’s motion is supported by new evidence, he has failed to establish that the such evidence is material. The respondent states that he had surgery on July 4, 2003. He submits two medical records dated July 4, 2003. See Respondent’s Motion at 2, Exhibits 2 through 5. It is impossible to discern from these documents the nature and extent of the respondent’s July 4, 2003, procedure. In any event, for purposes of section 240A(b) relief, the respondent must show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his qualifying family members, not himself. In short, the respondent’s motion does not meet the regulatory requirements for reopening. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rodriguez, Marco Antonio, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kathryn E. Stuever,
Assistant District Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 10, 2003. Following review of the arguments advanced on appeal, we are unpersuaded to disturb the Immigration Judge’s January 10, 2003, decision. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (regarding clear and obvious cases of ineffective assistance of counsel). Although the respondent raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he failed comply with all of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, and we do not find this a case in which the requirements should be overlooked. The record reflects that the respondent was present when the Immigration Judge announced the additional documents that were needed to support his adjustment application that needed to be filed within 90 days (Tr. at 16-18). The documents were not filed in a timely manner. Regarding the late submission, respondent’s then counsel stated: “There really is no excuse. I got documents late, but it’s my fault that it’s that late (Tr. at 26).” The record also indicates that the attorney had not received various documents (including the respondent’s pay stub and high school diploma) until the day of the hearing (Tr. at 27). Thus, there are indications in the record that the respondent did not provide documents to counsel in a manner which would have allowed their timely filing. The burden of clarifying such matters is on the respondent, who is now represented by new counsel. Yet the present motion neither clearly sets forth the claimed circumstances resulting in the late filing of the application and supporting documents nor provides prior counsel the opportunity to respond to any claim that such delay was attributable to his inadequate representation. We are not persuaded that failure to comply with the not burdensome procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada should excused or ignored on the record before us. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the alien is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the alien fails to so depart, the alien shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
*2 NOTICE: If the alien fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the alien shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - Nonimmigrant - remained longer than permitted
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration and reopening
 
In a decision dated April 17, 2003, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The respondent has appealed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
A brief procedural chronology follows. On February 3, 1998, an Immigration Judge issued an in absentia order of removal against the respondent when he failed to appear for the scheduled hearing. On May 21, 1998, the respondent, through former counsel, moved to reconsider the decision. On June 10, 1998, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion finding that the respondent had failed to establish exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. On January 24, 2003, the respondent, through present counsel, filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of his former counsel. On March 10, 2003, the Immigration Judge denied the motion for two reasons. First, the motion was found to be untimely. Second, the Immigration Judge held that the respondent had failed to comply with the procedural requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). On April 2, 2003, the respondent moved to reconsider the Immigration Judge’s decision, and on April 17, 2003, the motion was denied because it was untimely filed, and because of the Lozada defect.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen due to non-compliance with Matter of Lozada. An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), maybe rescinded only upon a motion to reopen, filed within 180 days, which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act; Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999). The Immigration Judge correctly determined in denying the motion to reopen that the motion was untimely filed, and that in absentia proceedings were properly conducted.
 
On appeal, the respondent claims that an individual in his former counsel’s office told him that he did not have to appear for the removal hearing. The respondent thus claims that there were exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. However, the motion to reopen proceedings was untimely. The respondent’s motion was submitted by present counsel on January 24, 2003, far more than 180 days after the Immigration Judge’s February 3, 1998, in absentia decision.
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent claims that his former counsel’s ineffectiveness constitutes an exception to the time and numerical bars on motions to reopen, the Board has held that an ineffective assistance claim does not qualify as an exception to the 180-day statutory limit for the filing of a motion to reopen or rescind an in absentia order of deportation. Matter of A-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998); Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec 113 (BIA 1998). The respondent in his affidavit admits that he was informed of the scheduled hearing date, but he failed to attend due to incorrect statements by an individual in former counsel’s office. The respondent, however, had the obligation to attend the scheduled hearing. See also Bejar v. Ashcroft, 324 F.3d 127 (3d Cir. 2003) (no exceptional circumstances shown where alien’s former counsel was notified of the hearing). The respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely and the Immigration Judge properly denied the motion to reopen and the subsequent motion to reconsider.
 
We also agree that the respondent’s motion to reopen based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was not properly made since the respondent failed to comply with the procedural requirements set out in Matter of Lozada. The fact that the respondent subsequently complied with those procedural requirements cannot remedy this fundamental defect. Finally, we have considered the respondent’s affidavit and the allegations he made against his former counsel. We have also considered the affidavit of the respondent’s former counsel, which was filed in response to the respondent’s bar complaint wherein he vigorously disputes the respondent’s allegations against him. See Ponce-Levia v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 369, 377 (3d Cir. 2003) (to advance a successful claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate prejudice--he “must show that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.”). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). In the case at hand former counsel’s affidavit has the ring of truth. Former counsel disputes the essential allegations made by the respondent. Former counsel writes that he never told his employee to tell the respondent that he should not appear in court for the scheduled hearing. Former counsel makes a convincing presentation at 4 of his affidavit that it would not have been logical for either himself or his employee who has since retired to negligently tell the respondent not to appear for the scheduled hearing. Former counsel also points out that the respondent received the notice of hearing from the Immigration Court which warned the respondent of the penalties for his failure to appear. In fact a copy of that hearing notice appears in the record of proceeding and is dated January 27, 1998. We find, therefore, that the respondent has not established the element of prejudice in his attempt to establish ineffective assistance of his former counsel. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lawrence Sizemore, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
June Y.I. Ito
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; remand; waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h); voluntary departure
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of South Korea, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s September 10, 2002, denial of her applications for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h) and adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) should have been equitably estopped from placing her into removal proceedings; that she did not receive a full and fair hearing because her motion to change venue was denied and because she received ineffective assistance of counsel and an incompetent interpreter; that section 212(h) of the Act is unconstitutional; and that the Immigration Judge erred in not granting her voluntary departure.
 
The first issue we consider is whether the DHS should have been equitably estopped from placing the respondent into removal proceedings. This Board is without authority to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel against the DHS so as to preclude it from undertaking a lawful course of action that it is empowered to pursue by statute and regulation. Matter of Hernandez-Puente, 20 I&N Dec. 335 (BIA 1991). The respondent does not allege that the DHS acted beyond its authority. Moreover, it is well within the DHS’s authority and prosecutorial discretion to initiate removal proceedings. Matter of Ramirez-Somera, 20 I&N Dec. 564 (BIA 1992); see also Matter of U-M-, 20 I&N Dec. 327 (BIA 1991); Matter of Torres, 19 I&N Dec. 371 (BIA 1986); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980); Matter of Geronimo, 13 I&N Dec. 680 (BIA 1971).
 
The second issue we consider is whether the respondent received a full and fair hearing. The respondent claims that the denial of her motion to change venue, the ineffective assistance of her attorneys,1 and an incompetent interpreter deprived her of a full and fundamentally fair hearing in violation of her right to due process.
 
*2 With respect to the motion to change venue, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that motions to change venue are left to the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, but an arbitrary refusal to change venue can be a violation of the statutory right to a reasonable opportunity to attend and present evidence at the deportation hearing. Campos v. Nail, 43 F.3d 1285 (9th Cir. 1994), citing Baires v. INS, 856 F.2d 89, 92 (9th Cir. 1988). In this case, the Immigration Judge did not make an arbitrary decision. The Immigration Judge considered the respondent’s circumstances that her residence and business were in Maryland as was her disabled husband who was supposed to testify on her behalf. Tr. at 11-24. However, on the day the Immigration Judge considered the motion, the respondent and her attorneys were already present in court and were scheduled to proceed with a merits hearing. Also, the Immigration Judge was willing to allow the respondent’s husband to testify via telephone. Thus, the respondent was not deprived of a full and fair hearing due to the Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to change venue. We also find that the respondent was not deprived a full and fair hearing due to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In addition, the Ninth Circuit has held that to show a deprivation of due process caused by ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien must show that counsel’s ineffective performance prejudiced her. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2002). Prejudice results when the “performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Id., citing Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999).
 
Although the respondent has complied with the Lozada requirements, she cannot show that the performance of her attorneys was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.2 Id. The respondent claims that instead of raising the substantive issue of whether her crimes arose out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct for purposes of removability, her attorneys conceded removability without advising her of the consequences and without her consent. The respondent also claims that she was not advised of the option to seek voluntary departure in lieu of a removal proceeding in order to avoid having to establish good moral character. Finally, the respondent claims that because her attorneys transferred her file to her new attorney in Maryland before the Immigration Judge decided the motion to change venue, they were completely unprepared for the merits hearing and were unable to submit any evidence or documents in support of her claim. Respondent’s Brief at 32-36.
 
*3 We first consider the issue of removability. We find that the failure of the respondent’s attorneys to contest removability at the hearing would not have affected the outcome of the case because the respondent is removable for having committed two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct. Section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act. The Ninth Circuit has held that completed crimes committed on different dates or in different places are presumed to be separate and different crimes not arising out of a single scheme. See Leon-Hernandez v. INS, 926 F.2d 902 (9th Cir. 1991), citing Chanan Din Khan v. Barber, 253 F.2d 547, 548 (9th Cir. 1958). To rebut this presumption an alien must do more than simply present “any evidence” of a common scheme. Id. There must be evidence of a conscious, coherent plan or program of future action. Id. A vague, indeterminate expectation to repeat a prior criminal modus operandi is not enough to establish a single scheme. Id., adopting Nason v. INS, 394 F.2d 223 (2d Cir. 1968).
 
In this case, the respondent was convicted of two counts of prostitution in violation of Hawaii Revised Statute § 712-1200. According to the police report included with the respondent’s brief, the Honolulu Police Department had an ongoing undercover investigation of prostitution and other Morals related offenses at the respondent’s place of employment, Rainbow Toning & Oriental Relaxation Therapy. After offering two different undercover police officers sex for money on two separate days, the respondent was arrested and subsequently convicted. These facts raise the presumption that the crimes did not arise out of a single scheme and this presumption has not been rebutted. There is no evidence that the respondent’s offer of sex for money to two different individuals on two different days was part of a conscious, coherent plan or program of future action. Leon-Hernandez v. INS, supra. While the respondent’s convictions arose out of the single scheme of an ongoing undercover police investigation, her criminal misconduct leading to those convictions was no more than an indeterminate expectation that her customers would be willing to pay her for sex. Leon-Hernandez v. INS, supra. The respondent also argues that her criminal misconduct arose out of a single scheme because she was not given the mandatory sentence of 30 days imprisonment under Hawaii law for subsequent offenses. Respondent’s Brief at 20. We decline to accept this argument. The State’s decision on how to treat the respondent’s crimes for sentencing purposes does not affect the “single scheme” analysis established by the Ninth Circuit for immigration purposes. Accordingly, we find that the respondent is removable for having committed two crimes involving moral turpitude, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct and that the failure of her attorneys to contest removability did not affect the outcome of her case.
 
*4 We now consider the other bases for the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim. Failure to advise the respondent of the option to seek voluntary departure in lieu of a removal proceeding did not affect the outcome of the proceeding. The respondent does not allege that she would have opted for voluntary departure in lieu of a proceeding if it had been offered. Moreover, all of the evidence in the record shows that the respondent wanted to stay in the United States with her husband. This desire by the respondent suggests that her attorneys made a tactical decision to go forward with the proceeding in order to obtain a waiver of inadmissibility so that the respondent could remain in the United States. Tactical decisions, even if in hindsight unwise, do not constitute ineffective assistance. Thorsteinsson v. INS, 724 F.2d 1365, 1367-68 (9th Cir. 1984). Likewise, the premature decision to transfer the respondent’s file to her new attorney in Maryland does not constitute ineffective assistance. Although the respondent’s attorneys did not have the file for her merits hearing, they had already submitted many documents in support of her claim; both the Immigration Judge and the DHS attorney had these documents in their files. In addition, the Immigration Judge continued the hearing to give her attorneys a chance to retrieve the file. Tr. at 57-58. Finally, all of the documents submitted to support the respondent’s application for a discretionary 212(h) waiver were ultimately moot because she was statutorily ineligible for the waiver. See section 212(h) (stating that a lawful permanent resident cannot be granted a waiver if she has not lawfully resided in the United States for 7 years immediately preceding the initiation of removal proceedings).3 Accordingly, the foregoing actions by the respondent’s attorneys did not affect the outcome of the proceeding. We also find that the respondent was not deprived of a full and fair hearing due to an incompetent interpreter.
 
The interpreter’s errors cited on appeal are not significant. The respondent has not identified any examples of material testimony which was not translated, or explained how the Immigration Judge relied on incorrectly translated testimony in reaching her decision, or demonstrated how a better translation would have made a difference in the outcome of the hearing. Perez-Lastor v. INS, 208 F.3d 773 (9th Cir. 2000); Hartooni v. INS, 21 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir. 1994); Matter of G-, 20 I&N Dec. 764 (BIA 1993); Matter of K-L-, 20 I&N Dec. 654 (BIA 1993); Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105, 107-08 (BIA 1984)
 
The third issue we consider is whether section 212(h) violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. We have repeatedly held that we are not empowered to rule on the constitutionality of the statutes and regulations that we administer. See Matter of C-, 20 I&N Dec. 529, 532 (BIA 1992); Matter of Hernandez-Puente, 20 I&N Dec. 335, 339 (BIA 1991); Matter of Fede, 20 I&N Dec. 35, 36 (BIA 1989); Matter of Valdovinos, 18 I&N Dec. 343, 345 (BIA 1982); Matter of Cenatice, 16 I&N Dec. 162, 166 (BIA 1977); Matter of L-, 4 I&N Dec. 556, 557 (BIA 1951).
 
*5 The final issue we consider is whether the Immigration Judge erred in denying the respondent voluntary departure. In order to be eligible for voluntary departure at the conclusion of proceedings the alien must show, inter alia, that she is, and has been, a person of good moral character for at least 5 years immediately preceding the alien’s application for voluntary departure. Section 240B(b)(1)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(1)(B). However, as defined, an alien cannot establish good moral character if she is a member of one of the classes of persons described in, inter alia, section 212(a)(2)(D) of the Act, Prostitution and Commercialized Vice. Section 101(f)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)(3). The respondent certainly fits within the description of section 212(a)(2)(D) of the Act as a person who has engaged in prostitution within 10 years of the date of application for a visa, admission, or adjustment of status.4 Therefore, by definition, the respondent is statutorily ineligible for voluntary departure and the Immigration Judge did not err in making this finding.
 
Based on the foregoing, we find that the DHS was not equitably estopped from initiating proceedings, the respondent received a full and fundamentally fair hearing, the respondent is removable for having committed two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct, the respondent is statutorily ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, we do not have the power to consider the constitutionality of section 212(h) of the Act, and the Immigration Judge did not err in denying her voluntary departure.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on December 9, 2003, when we summarily affirmed without opinion an Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 2, 2002, finding her removable, as charged, but granting her the privilege of voluntary departure. On January 12, 2003, the respondent moved this Board to reconsider its decision alleging a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion is denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration, be supported by pertinent case precedent and be predicated on a legal or factual defect in the most recent decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). In her motion, the respondent does not specify the legal or factual defect in our previous decision, and we find no error in our decision that would warrant reconsideration. Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is more properly characterized as a motion to reopen, because the respondent asserts new facts and makes new allegations. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). To the extent the respondent alleges ineffective assistance by former counsel, we note that in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), we laid out the requirements that the respondent must meet in order to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. First, the motion should be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent attesting to the relevant facts. Second, before the allegation is presented to the Board, the former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond. Any subsequent response from counsel, or report of counsel’s failure or refusal to respond should be submitted with the motion. Finally, if it is asserted that prior counsel’s handling of the case involved a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, the motion should reflect “whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not.” Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997). Here, the respondent has failed to comply with any of the established requirements to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Moreover, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that she suffered prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra. We recognize that the present case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has held that rigid adherence to the procedural requirements established in Lozada is not always necessary. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir 2000). However, where the respondent has failed to comply with any of the Lozada requirements and where the respondent has also failed to show any prejudice, we are compelled to deny the motion to reopen. See Matter of Assaad, supra.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN RE: ELIZABETH BIRU
File: AXX XX5 092 - Arlington

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jim Tom Haynes, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
On August 5, 2003, the respondent filed with this Board a motion to reopen and remand, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the motion. The unopposed motion will granted.
 
In Matter of Lozada, supra, this Board discussed the criteria which must be present for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel arising in immigration proceedings: (1) the alien must provide an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement entered into with counsel regarding the actions to be taken, and what representations counsel did or did not make in this regard; (2) counsel whose integrity or competence has been impugned must be informed of the allegations leveled against him or her, and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) the evidence of record must reflect whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not.
 
In this case, the respondent has complied with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent’s alleges that although she was eligible to adjust her status based on an approved I-130 visa petition, her prior counsel failed to file a motion to remand with the Board during the pendency of her appeal. Furthermore, the respondent’s former counsel did not inform her that her appeal was dismissed and that she had been granted voluntary departure by the Board on November 4, 2002. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board in order to pursue her claim for adjustment of status but the motion was denied by the Board on April 12, 2003 because of the respondent’s failure to comply with the Board’s prior order of voluntary departure. The respondent supports her motion with an affidavit from one former counsel admitting that mistakes were made in the respondent’s case and that Counsel’s failure to act caused the respondent’s grant of voluntary departure to expire, causing substantial prejudice to the respondent. The DHS has raised no objection to respondent’s motion and arguments.
 
Accordingly, we find that the respondent has demonstrated that her failure to depart pursuant to the terms of our November 4, 2002, order was due to exceptional circumstances beyond her control. See generally Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996) (stating that ineffective assistance of counsel could constitute an exceptional circumstance for an alien’s failure to appear for his hearing). We further find that the respondent has submitted sufficient evidence with her motion to establish prima facie eligibility for the relief she seeks in reopened proceedings, and to demonstrate that the previous procedural defects resulted from the ineffective assistance of prior counsel.
 
*2 In light of the foregoing, the respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frederick P. Korkosz, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
On December 29, 2003, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. We have jurisdiction over this timely motion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. The motion will be denied.
 
The Board originally dismissed the respondent’s appeal on February 9, 2001, for not filing the appeal brief by the April 8, 1998, deadline. The Board reissued its decision on November 20, 2003, as the original order was not properly served. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, argues in his motion that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel when his former counsel neglected to file his appeal brief timely. He also requests reopening so that he may present new and previously unavailable evidence in support of his application for suspension of deportation under section 244(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254(a).
 
We first address the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In his motion to reopen, the respondent neither met the procedural requirements of a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, nor showed that he was prejudiced by his attorney’s failure to file the appeal brief. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); see also, Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108 (2d Cir. 1993). We find no merit in the respondent’s bare assertion, through current counsel, that his former counsel’s failure to file an appeal brief “clearly constitutes ineffective assistance.…” Motion at 2-3, para. 5. In Matter of Assaad, supra, the Board held that an attorney’s failure to file an appeal on behalf of an alien is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel. Instead, in addition to fulfilling the procedural requirements identified in Matter of Lozada, supra, the respondent is required to establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his former attorney’s ineffectiveness. Matter of Assaad, supra, at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Id. This means that the claimant must show thal he likely would have prevailed on appeal had the negligence not occurred. Id. The respondent, through current counsel, has not even attempted to show prejudice. Further, we find no merit in the respondent’s assertion, through current counsel, that he has been unable to “raise¿º” a “proper claim of ineffective assistance of counsel” because he has been unable to determine which of the two former attorneys was responsible for having failed to file the appeal brief. Motion at 2-3, para. 5. The respondent and his current counsel have had since at least August 4, 2003, the date of the filing of current counsel’s Notice of Entry of Appearance before the Board, to arrange with the Board’s Clerk’s Office opportunity to review the record. Board of Immigration Appeals Practice Manual, 1.5(c).
 
*2 Moreover, having reviewed the entire record, we find no prejudice. The record shows that the respondent received a fair and complete hearing before the Immigration Judge, and was provided every opportunity to present his application for suspension of deportation during the proceedings below. At the hearing, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had not demonstrated that his return to Mexico would result in extreme hardship within the meaning of the immigration law (I.J. at 6-9). Nothing in the respondent’s motion convinces us that the respondent likely would have prevailed on appeal of the extreme hardship determination. See Tr. at 13, et. seq.; Exh. 3, Group Exh. 4 (evidence presented below in support of suspension application demonstrating only economic, social, and emotional hardships ordinarily faced by similarly situated deportees, and not other substantial equities such as advanced age or severe illness). Matter of Anderson, 16 I&N Dec. 596 (BIA 1978); Matter of Chumpitazi, 16 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 1978); see also, INS v. Wang, 450 US 139 (1981).
 
Next, we address the respondent’s motion to reopen to present new evidence in support of his application for suspension of deportation. With his motion, the respondent attached evidence of the hardship he and his 8-year-old United States citizen son would likely face upon the respondent’s deportation. In particular, the respondent provided evidence of community ties that he has developed since he came to the United States. He also provided evidence indicating that, were his son to accompany him to Mexico, his son would suffer both economic and social detriment, and, were his son to remain in the United States, his son would likely suffer profound loss. Considering this evidence, both individually and cumulatively, we find that the respondent has not demonstrated that, if his motion to reopen were granted, the new evidence presented would likely change the result of the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
In his motion, the respondent failed to show factors that demonstrate extreme hardship over and above the normal economic and social disruptions involved in deportation. Matter of Kao and Lin, 23 I&N Dec. 45 (BIA 2001); Matter of Pilch, 21 I&N Dec. 627 (BIA 1996); Matter of Anderson, supra. Economic detriment and the loss of social and educational opportunities does not amount to extreme hardship because these hardships are likely to occur in most cases involving the deportation of aliens to comparatively economically depressed countries. We note that there is no evidence demonstrating whether it is the respondent’s intention for his United States citizen son to move to Mexico, or for the child to remain in this country. Matter of Ige, 20 I & N Dec. 880, 885 (1994). We also note that, were the child to go to Mexico, the evidence offered would not change the result of the case. The respondent’s young son would not suffer extreme hardship within the meaning of the immigration law, as the child has some Spanish language skills; he is young and only in elementary school; and there is no evidence offered to indicate physical or mental infirmities that would be of particular disadvantage to the family in Mexico. Matter of Kao and Lin, supra.; Matter of Pilch, supra. For these reasons, we conclude that the respondent did not show that he likely would prevail were the case reopened. Matter of Coelho, supra.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se1
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on July 29, 1998. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not relevant here), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before October 27, 1998. The record reflects, however, that the respondent’s motion was not filed with the Board until November 7, 2003. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time.
 
The respondent states he never received a copy of the Board’s July 29, 1998 order. A review of the record indicates it was mailed to respondent’s former attorney of record on that date, and that it was not returned as undeliverable by the postal service. To the extent the respondent appears to be making a claim of ineffective assistance, we note that a motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. In addition, the motion must establish prejudice arising from the alleged failings of prior counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10. (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent here has failed to meet these requirements.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied. As the motion to reopen is denied, the motion for a stay of deportation is also denied.

IN RE: MAURICIO JIMENEZ A.K.A. MAURICIO JIMENEZ-ACEVADO
File: A29 647 227 - Denver
February 20, 2004
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raul Villasuso, Jr., Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
Sec. 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening or reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent’s October 16, 2003, motion to reopen/reconsider is denied. The respondent contends that the failure of his former counsel to notify him of this Board’s December 27, 2000, summary dismissal of the original appeal amounted to ineffective representation. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Otherwise, the respondent apparently contends, be could have timely filed a motion to reopen to pursue relief under former section 212(c) of Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), in light of the United States Supreme Court decision, INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2.
 
Aside from the question of whether the filing period for motions should be equitably tolled in light of the respondent’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, or in light of the new in interpretation of the law per INS v. St. Cyr, supra, we find that the respondent has failed to show that he has been prejudiced or that he is entitled to any relief. We observe that the respondent does not contend in his motion that his former attorney should have filed the appellate brief that was promised in the Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26), nor does the respondent assert that the appeal form contained or should have contained any meaningful argument, even though these were the reasons we previously dismissed the appeal. Notably, the respondent has failed to assert that his prior attorney should have requested any particular relief before the Immigration Judge.
 
The record reflects thin in 1989, the respondent was admitted for permanent residence on a conditional basis. This status was terminated 2 years later, however, for the failure of both the respondent and his spouse to attend an interview in connection with the joint petition to remove the conditional status. The respondent was convicted on June 1, 1994, in Wisconsin for delivery of cocaine. He asserts that he pled guilty to this offense in 1993.
 
The respondent is not a lawful permanent resident, and he has not presented evidence of lawful unrelinquished domicile of 7 years or more. The respondent, therefore, was ineligible for section 212(c) relief at the time of his guilty plea and conviction, and at the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision, regardless of later changes in the law that affected other applicants for this waiver. Clearly the Immigration Judge did not apply the AEDPA1 in pretermitting the respondent’s 212(c) application since that 1996 enactment did not exist at the time of the Immigration Judge’s 1995 decision. The respondent was simply held to be ineligible for any relief at the time. Thus, any purported ineffective assistance of counsel would have been harmless in light of the respondent’s continued ineligibility for relief.
 
*2 In his motion the respondent may be attempting to blame his former attorney for a bond forfeiture which allegedly resulted from the respondent’s failure to appear for deportation. The respondent did not state that the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) failed to notify him of a time and place of departure, i.e. with a so-called “bag and baggage” letter. More importantly, while this Board has appellate jurisdiction over the setting of conditions and the amount of a bond, the question of a forfeited payment to a presumably private bondsman is not an issue over which we have jurisdiction, nor could it properly be part of these deportation proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(b)(7), 1003.19, 1236.1(d)(1)-(4).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Jose W. Vega, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Charlotte K. Lang
Assistant District Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM: This case was last before us on August 22, 2003, when we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondents’ applications for relief. The respondents have now filed a motion to reopen their removal proceedings, arguing that they were the victims of ineffective assistance of counsel when their former counsel failed to properly put forward their claim for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has filed an opposition to the respondents’ motion. The motion is denied.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondents have satisfied in their motion the procedural requirements set forth in Lozada, supra. However, this Board has held that satisfying the above procedural requirements is in and of itself an insufficient reason to reopen. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). It is also required that the claimants establish that they suffered prejudice as a result of the attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id.
 
In the instant case, the respondents received a fair and complete hearing before the Immigration Judge. They were adequately represented by counsel throughout their proceedings, and were provided every opportunity to present their claim for cancellation of removal. At the hearing, the Immigration Judge determined that the adult respondents had not met their burden of proof with respect to demonstrating that their removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to their United States citizen child or to the female respondent’s lawful permanent resident mother. The Immigration Judge also noted that the minor respondent was not eligible for this form of relief from removal. In addition, the Immigration Judge properly found that all respondents were statutorily ineligible for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b).
 
*2 The respondents’ motion does not present the contents of the evidence or testimony they allege was not presented due to their counsel’s ineffective assistance. Therefore, the respondents cannot establish that this evidence would have met their burden of proof for cancellation of removal, and that they were prejudiced by its absence. Consequently, we cannot reopen these proceedings. Matter of Assaad, supra. The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Richard Fraade, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. An Immigration Judge denied the respondents cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), as being unable to show that removal would cause “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” to the United States citizen children of the adult respondents. We dismissed the respondents’ appeal on June 12, 2002, and denied a motion to reconsider this decision on December 9, 2002. On November 21, 2003, the respondents filed a “Motion to Vacate And Reinstate Previous Order Dated June 12, 2002”, which we will construe as a motion to reopen. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondents allege that their former representatives failed to file a petition for review with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but instead submitted the unsuccessful motion to reconsider. They therefore seek to have the Board reinstate its June 12, 2002, decision. The respondents have not met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Specifically, they fail to show prejudice resulting from their representatives’ actions, as the Ninth Circuit lacked jurisdiction to review a discretionary determination to deny cancellation of removal. Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, 327 F.3d 887 (9th Cir. 2003). As the court stated, supra, at 888, “… we conclude that an “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” determination is a subjective, discretionary judgment that has been carved out of our appellate jurisdiction.” Their representatives’ alleged failure to pursue a petition for review in the Ninth Circuit therefore caused the respondents no prejudice. The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert Gibbs, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Eric Bakken
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The record is remanded. This case was last before us on December 14, 2001, when we remanded the record to permit the respondent FN;B1[FN1]co_anchor_FN_F1_94 to apply for an adjustment of status based upon his approved labor certification (Form I-140). We remanded at that time to permit the respondent to file his application for adjustment (Form I-485).
 
On remand, the respondent failed to meet the Immigration Judge’s filing deadline of March 18, 2002, for the adjustment application, and the respondent was ordered removed on May 16, 2002. The respondent did not file an appeal of that decision because he was apparently unaware of it.
 
In May 2003, the respondent moved to reopen proceedings before the Immigration Judge, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel; it was asserted that a California law firm, which the respondent had retained, failed to timely file the adjustment application.2 See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (regarding the requirements to properly set forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); see also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000) (Lozada requirements are “generally reasonable” but not “sacrosanct”); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 559, n.6 (BIA 2003) (reaffirming the standards set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, and noting that the Ninth Circuit has adopted a flexible approach to the Lozada requirements). In a May 28, 2003, decision denying the motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge found, inter alia, that the respondent had failed to meet the Lozada requirements because he did not provide the accused counsel in question with any opportunity to respond to the allegations, nor had the respondent filed a complaint with the state bar concerning this allegedly inadequate representation. The motion was also denied as being untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). The respondent appealed.
 
In analyzing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Ninth Circuit has recognized that “equitable tolling” of deadlines may occur where an alien is prevented from filing a claim for relief because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the alien acts with “due diligence” in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003); see also Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
*2 The record reflects that the respondent worked actively in March 2002 to present his application for adjustment with all the necessary paperwork. We find that this reflects due diligence. The law firm in question that was supposed to file the application was repeatedly notified by the respondent’s counsel of record, Kaaren Barr, about the urgent need to meet the filing deadline set by the Immigration Judge. While we are concerned that the respondent perhaps did not maintain enough contact with his counsel of record or the Immigration Court, he did appear to be working quite diligently with the law firm which was to file his paperwork. He had every reason to believe that he was appropriately and timely filing his adjustment of status application. He was also apparently advised by that firm that it would handle his application and that he need not work with Ms. Barr toward that end.
 
The respondent is correct in his assertion that the California law firm’s failure to timely file such an application for relief—particularly given the respondent’s cooperation with the firm and its apparent knowledge of the deadline—is ineffective assistance of counsel. The purported failure of the respondent to provide an exact amount for a filing fee—he provided $70 in excess—is insufficient reason for the application not to have been timely filed and does not explain the long delay even after this problem was apparently cured. Pursuant to the previously cited Ninth Circuit case law, the respondent is correct that these circumstances adequately set forth a claim of ineffective assistance without the necessity of a bar complaint or a complaint to the counsel of record. The respondent was highly prejudiced by the California law firm’s failure to file, and there is no evidence of record that would excuse the firm’s failure to do so. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra; Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, supra; Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, supra; Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra.
 
In light of the foregoing, the deadline to file the adjustment application was tolled. But for the California firm’s ineffective assistance, the respondent should not have been in a position where he would need to file a motion to reopen. Moreover, that firm had an additional obligation, whether it was counsel of record or not, to advise him that it filed the application late. Its failure to do so further prejudiced the respondent’s interests. Accordingly, the deadline to file the motion to reopen was also tolled.
 
We also do not uphold the Immigration Judge’s application of the “fugitive disentitlement doctrine,” which does not appear to be applicable to this case. Cf. Antonio-Martinez v. INS, 317 F.3d 1089 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
As it now appears that the respondent is prima facie eligible to adjust his status, we will reopen proceedings, and remand the record for consideration of his adjustment application. The respondent is not precluded from seeking any other relief for which he may be entitled.
 
*3 FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings in accordance with the foregoing opinion and for the entrY of a new decision.

The respondent’s spouse, Silvia Jimenez (A95-591-903) and son Juan Carlos Jimenez Ramos (A95-591-904) were separately placed in proceedings but their only claim for relief derives solely from the respondent’s claim. We find it unnecessary at this stage of the proceedings to formally consolidate the appeals. The respondent’s spouse and son are the subject of a separate decision.

Specifically, the respondent’s current attorney, Robert Gibbs, filed the motion on the respondent’s behalf with the cooperation of the respondent’s former attorney of record, Kaaren Barr, against the California law firm of James Roche.

U.S. Department of Justice

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: SONIA S. MAKILING
File: AXX XX6 226 - Baltimore
February 18, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mariana Vazquez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Linda A. Dominguez
Assistant District Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen before the Board. We last addressed this case on April 10, 2003, when we summarily affirmed an earlier order of an Immigration Judge. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent seeks reopening to pursue adjustment of status. See section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255. To support her motion, the respondent initially provided proof that an employer filed an application for a labor certification on her behalf which was dated April 9, 2001. On August 11, 2003, the respondent provided evidence that the labor certification was approved on August 3, 2003.
 
The respondent’s motion is deficient as it does not include a completed Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status (Form I-485), or any other documentation outside of the labor certification which indicates that she is otherwise eligible for adjustment of status. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1)(“a motion to reopen for the purpose of submitting an application must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.”); see also Matter of Yewondwosen, 21 I&N Dec. 1025 (BIA 1997). We point out that on July 28, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security (formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) filed a response to the motion which specifically objected to the motion on this basis. The respondent did submit the approved labor certification after this date, but failed to remedy the other defects in her motion. Therefore, she has not met the requirements for filing a motion to reopen. The respondent’s motion also fails to include an approved visa petition, or any evidence that a petition is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(g). The respondent’s motion to reopen to pursue adjustment of status will therefore be denied.
 
In her motion, the respondent asserts that her appellate counsel was ineffective. However, she only supports this by attaching a copy of the appeal brief. We have no statement from the respondent herself, or a clear indication of how she was ultimately prejudiced by the conduct of her counsel, or how this claim should impact the adjudication of her motion to roepen. The respondent has therefore not met her burden of proving that any reopening is warranted based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d 879 (2 nd Cir. 1994); cf. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (discussing requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 We conclude that the motion to reopen should be denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David Paz Soldan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julia C. Chimarusti
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on November 17, 2003, when this Board dismissed as untimely the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reconsider. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider asserts that at the time of the Board’s previous decision an error was made. It “questions the Board’s decision for alleged errors in appraising the facts and the law.” Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). We note that the respondent in this case has presented no error of law or fact in the Board’s prior decision. Instead the respondent makes a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,1 explaining that the notice of appeal was sent Federal Express mail to the Board on September 25, 2003, one day before it was due at the Board. Due to a typographical error in the zip code, respondent’s appeal was not delivered to the Board the next day.
 
A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. In addition, the motion must establish prejudice arising from the alleged failings of prior counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). While counsel for respondent has filed an affidavit acknowledging fault on his part, the respondent has not filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary committee for the state of California. We also note, that despite this claim of ineffective assistance, the respondent has continued to utilize the services of the attorney in question.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

File: A77 618 752 - Atlanta
February 18, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
CERTIFICATION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marco Pignone III, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The Board will return the record to the Immigration Judge for preparation of a complete record.
 
On February 24, 2000, at a scheduled hearing conducted in absentia, the Immigration Judge found the respondent to be removable from the United States. The respondent filed a motion to reopen claiming that he did not receive notice of the hearing, and a supplemental motion to reopen claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. On November 9, 2000, the Immigration Judge denied reopening, and the respondent filed an appeal from that decision.
 
Upon consideration of the appeal, we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. We found that the notice of the February 24, 2000, hearing was sent to an attorney who formerly represented the respondent. The record, however, did not contain a Notice of Entry of Appearance before the Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28) from that attorney. In our decision, we stressed that whenever a person is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to the attorney or representative of record, or to the person himself if unrepresented. See sections 239(a)(1) and 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229(a)(1) and 1229a(b)(5); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). Inasmuch as notice should have been provided to the respondent himself as an unrepresented alien, we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge on October 28, 2002, for further proceedings.
 
On March 21, 2003, the Immigration Judge certified this case back to the Board. The Immigration Judge stated that “the entire record of proceedings was not located before the record was submitted to the Board … (and) did not include the Form EOIR-28 from the respondent’s (former) counsel” (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge further states that “¿tºo supplement the now complete record, a copy of the Form EOIR-28 submitted by the initial attorney is attached to (the March 21, 2003) Order” (I.J. at 2). In the record now before us, however, the Form EOIR-28 at issue is not attached to the Immigration Judge’s decision. As we consider the Form EOIR-28 from respondent’s former counsel to be necessary for our review of this matter, we will return the record to the Immigration Court for further action. Upon receipt of the record, the Immigration Court shall take such steps as are necessary and appropriate to enable preparation of a complete record, beginning with the Notice to Appear, and to ensure that the record is complete before certifying the case to the Board. Accordingly, the record is returned to the Immigration Judge for further action as deemed appropriate.1

Following the Immigration Judge’s March 21, 2003, decision certifying the appeal to this Board, the respondent filed a motion to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for reconsideration of his ineffective assistant of counsel claim. We note, however, that the respondent failed to comply with the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Specifically, the respondent failed to explain the absence of evidence that a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of the ethical or legal responsibilities of the respondent’s former attorney. Id. at 639. We will not consider the respondent’s motion further at this time.

IN RE: GORDON, ONIEL
File: AXX-XX3-407 - OAKDALE
February 12, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro Se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision dated December 15, 2003. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2), a motion to reconsider a decision must be filed with the Board within 30 days after the mailing of the Board decision or on or before July 31, 1996, whichever is later. The record reflects that on December 15, 2003, this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the decision of an Immigration Judge. Because the respondent’s motion to reconsider was filed more than 30 days after the mailing of the Board’s prior decision, it is untimely. We have considered the respondent’s argument that the Board should accept his motion to reconsider based upon his contention that his former attorney was negligent. According to the respondent, his former attorney fold him only a week before his motion to reconsider was due that his appeal was dismissed. The respondent claimed that his attorney’s dereliction of duty caused him to be unable to file his motion on time.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The Board has also held that satisfying the above procedural requirements is in and of itself an insufficient reason to reopen, and that an attorney’s failure to file an appeal on behalf of an alien is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Id. This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. In Matter of Assaad, supra, the Board indicated that an attorney’s failure to file an appeal brief on behalf of an alien is not per se negligence.
 
*2 In the instant case, the respondent has not complied with the above requirements. His complaint filed against his attorney does not address the failure to file the motion to reconsider. Rather, it addresses the failure to file a brief in support of the appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision. We further find no error in the Board’s prior order in this matter even had the motion been timely filed. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

File: A77 843 699 - Council Bluffs
February 11, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James A. Benzoni, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening and remand
 
In a decision dated February 19, 2001, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia after she failed to appear for a removal hearing. On November 13, 2002, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. In a decision dated December 11, 2002, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen. The respondent timely filed an appeal, as well as a motion to remand or reopen, alleging that she had received ineffective assistance of counsel from her prior attorney. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, entered the United States without inspection on October 21, 1988. On July 19, 2000, the DHS served the respondent with a Notice to Appear. In a letter dated September 18, 2001, mailed to the respondent’s attorney at the time, she was notified of the hearing scheduled on February 19, 2002. The respondent has acknowledged that she received notice of this hearing but claims that she was unable to attend the hearing because her vehicle broke down while she was on her way to the hearing. However, the Immigration Judge, having been provided with no reasonable cause for why the respondent was absent from the hearing, conducted it in absentia and found the respondent removable as charged. She was ordered removed to Mexico.
 
With the assistance of her former counsel, Rufino Villarreal, a motion to reopen was filed on November 13, 2002, alleging that the respondent had had transportation problems on her way to Court and that was the reason why she missed the February 19, 2002 hearing. A car repair bill was submitted with the motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposed the motion, arguing that it had not been filed in a timely manner within the 180-day period following the Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
On December 11, 2002, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, finding that the respondent had failed to meet her burden of establishing that exceptional circumstances had prevented her from attending the hearing. The Immigration Judge noted that the evidence submitted, a mechanics bill, was dated March 16, 2002, nearly a month after the hearing date and did not demonstrate the alleged vehicle problems on the date of the hearing. The respondent secured the assistance of another attorney, who filed an appeal on January 3, 2003, alleging that the respondent had received ineffective assistance from her former counsel. Additional evidence with regard to the respondent’s vehicle breakdown on February 19, 2002, was submitted. In addition, evidence was submitted as to the ineffective assistance of the respondent’s former counsel. The respondent’s attorney also submitted a motion to remand on January 21, 2003.
 
*2 The respondent argues ineffective assistance of counsel for several reasons, including that the prior attorney failed to file the respondent’s initial motion to reopen in a timely manner. The evidence shows that the respondent’s initial motion to reopen was not filed within the 180-day limit provided for under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Immigration Judge’s decision was dated February 19, 2002, and the motion was not filed until November 13, 2002. Accordingly, the issue is whether a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes an exception to, or results in equitable tolling of, this 180-day time limit.
 
Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act expressly requires that a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia deportation order based on exceptional circumstances be filed within 180 days of the order. Because the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed well beyond the 180 days allotted by the statute, we find that she is statutorily barred from rescinding the removal order.
 
The respondent basically argues that there should be an exception to this 180-day rule where the failure to timely file a motion to reopen is due to the ineffective assistance of counsel. Initially, we note that there appears to be no question that the respondent has properly set forth her claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). As the respondent has noted, the Executive Office for Immigration Review and the Board have issued disciplinary actions against the respondent’s former attorney. However, as egregious as the prior attorney’s conduct in this case, the Board has held that such a claim does not constitute an exception to the 180-day statutory limit for the filing of a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia order of deportation, which is now referred to as removal. See Matter of A-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998); Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998). The language of section 240(b)(5)(c) of the Act regarding the time limit within which a motion to reopen must be filed is clear on its face and unambiguous, and the statute contains no exceptions to this time bar. See Matter of A-A-, supra; Matter of Lei, supra.1 Had Congress intended to provide for an exception to the 180-day time limit based on the ineffective assistance of counsel, it could have done so. The Board has found that the legislative history demonstrates that the 180-day limit reflects congressional intent to bring finality to in absentia deportation (or removal) proceedings. See id.
 
Therefore, given that the statute is explicit in its requirement that a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days of the in absentia removal order, and considering the legislative history of the language now found at 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, we continue to hold that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not an exception to the 180-day time limit imposed by that section of the Act. Accordingly, we find that the respondent is statutorily barred from rescinding the order of removal based on “exceptional circumstances” pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, regardless of whether she has demonstrated that the failure to timely file the motion to reopen is attributable to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*3 We note that the hearing in this case was held in Omaha, Nebraska, and the precedent of the United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit, applies in this case. It does not appear that the Eighth Circuit has previously addressed the issue of whether the 180-day period for filing a motion to reopen should be equitably tolled where the petitioner alleges that ineffective assistance of counsel caused the delay in filing such a motion. Other circuit courts that have addressed the issue are split. See Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding that INA § 242B(c)(3)(A) sets forth a “mandatory and jurisdictional” time bar); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that INA § 242B(c)(3)(A)’s time bar is not jurisdictional and thus subject to equitable tolling); Lavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding that the equitable tolling doctrine applies to the 90-day period provided in 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(1)(2000) for filing motions to reopen based on “new facts”). The Ninth Circuit has held that the limitation period on a motion to reopen an in absentia deportation order based on exceptional circumstances was equitably tolled until the alien was aware of the harm resulting from the misconduct of her representative. Fajardo v. INS, 300 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
In the present case, we have no binding precedent from the Eighth Circuit or the Board that “equitable tolling” applies to the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, because the respondent’s initial motion to reopen was filed in an untimely manner and she has not shown “exceptional circumstances,” the appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated December 11, 2002, denying that motion to reopen, is dismissed.
 
As for the motion to remand, the requirements for such a motion are, for all practical purposes, the same as those for a motion to reopen. See Matter of Ige, 20 I&N Dec. 880, 884 (BIA 1994). The respondent has submitted additional evidence but it pertains to the underlying motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia deportation order. Based on the analysis above, remanding this case for the Immigration Judge to review the additional evidence would be a futile exercise because even if the additional evidence supports a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel, the initial motion to reopen was not timely filed and ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute “exceptional circumstances” on which to grant a motion on reopen. Therefore, the motion to remand is denied.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

Although the Board in Matter of A-A- and in Matter of Lei was construing the language of section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act, this section was repealed by Section 308(b)(6) of the Illegal Immigration Reform & Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, enacted as Division C of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, and the Judiciary Appropriations Act for 1997, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996). The same provisions, with reference to an in absentia removal order instead of an in absentia deportation order, are now found in section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: MOHAMENUL HOQE
File: AXX XX7 421 - Chicago
February 10, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael J. Hernandez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Karl V. Cozad
Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal will be dismissed. The record reflects that the respondent waived appeal. The summary of the Immigration Judge’s oral decision, as well as the transcribed order, dated August 29, 2002, noted that the respondent had waived appeal. We also note that the transcript of proceedings, page 8, lines 9-10, reflects that then counsel for the respondent waived appeal. On September 27, 2002, the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26). Upon review, we find that this case is not properly before us as the respondent has failed to establish that the decision to waive appeal was not a knowing and intelligent one.
 
Counsel for the respondent asserts that the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) did not object to prior counsel’s motion for a continuance or administrative closure of the proceedings held August 29, 2002. However, the DHS did oppose the motion, both in writing and on the record (Tr. at 5-6). See Matter of Gutierrez, 21 I&N Dec. 479, 480 (BIA 1996) (proceedings may not be administratively closed if such closure is opposed by either party), and cases cited therein. Further, counsel argues that the respondent’s prior counsel waived appeal without first consulting the respondent. However, the record reveals that counsel went off the record to discuss the respondent’s options with him (Tr. at 7-8), and indeed the respondent states as much in the affidavit accompanying his appeal brief. The respondent claims that he received ineffective assistance from prior counsel, but he has failed to meet any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel), or otherwise to establish such a claim. Here, counsel for the respondent agreed to waive appeal in order to receive a grant of 120 days voluntary departure, pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b), (e). The respondent has not shown that his waiver was not knowing and intelligent.
 
Thus, the Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s request for stay of removal pending adjudication of his appeal is denied as moot in light of the above decision.
