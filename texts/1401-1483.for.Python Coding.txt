IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Camille O. Bowman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Scott D. Gordon
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider our earlier denial of a motion to reopen on October 20, 2003. The motion, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service)1, will be denied.
 
In our October 20, 2003, decision we considered a motion claiming ineffective assistance of the respondent’s former attorney. We determined that the motion to reopen, having been filed almost 10 months after our final order of August 28, 2002, had been filed out of time. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
Despite the respondent’s arguments in the motion to reconsider, we still find no adequate excuse for the lateness of the respondent’s motion to reopen. As we stated in our earlier decision, our August 28, 2002, decision was promptly received by the respondent (Respondent’s Affidavit to Motion to Reopen). When the respondent consulted an individual he considered to be his attorney about the Board’s decision, the attorney said he was unable to assist him. Id. The respondent then waited to hire new counsel for 9 months. Id. Certain courts have determined that time and numerical limitations on motions to reopen may be equitably tolled. See Scorteanu v. INS, 339 F.3d 407, 413 (6th Cir.2003). However, equitable tolling is unavailable when, as here, a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf. Id.; Dunlap v. United States, 250 F.3d 1001, 1008 (6th Cir. 2001)(“statute of limitations may only be tolled where the circumstances are both beyond the petitioner’s control and unavoidable even with due diligence”).
 
We also stated in our decision that the DHS opposed reopening. The respondent argues in his motion to reconsider that the DHS opposition was filed untimely, and the motion should have been deemed unopposed. Even were we to determine that the DHS opposition should not have been considered, we would have reached the same result. An exception to an untimely motion is made when a motion is “agreed upon by all parties and jointly filed.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(iii). This exception was clearly inapplicable in this case.
 
We also stated in our October 20, 2003, decision that the respondent had failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Specifically, we noted that the motion did not demonstrate that the respondent had filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority, or adequately explained why no filing was made. The respondent argues that he had, in fact, filed a disciplinary complaint, but was prohibited from divulging this to the Board. As the motion to reopen was filed late, we would have dismissed the motion to reopen as untimely even had the respondent complied with the Lozada requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We note, in any event, that the Board of Professional Responsibility of the Supreme Court of Tennessee determined that the respondent’s complaint was “unfounded”, and the complaint was “dismissed” (Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider, at Exh. 6).
 
*2 The motion to reconsider is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Emmanuel Enyinwa, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James S. Stolley, Jr.
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (all respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This matter was last before the Board on April 29, 2002, at which time the Immigration Judge’s March 23, 2000, decision was summarily affirmed without opinion. On August 13, 2002, the respondents filed a motion to reopen. The respondents acknowledge that the motion was not filed in a timely fashion, but they urge that the time period for filing the motion should be equitably tolled because they received ineffective assistance of counsel who represented them before the Board.2 The Immigration and Naturalization Service (the “Service,” now the Department of Homeland Security) has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied as untimely.
 
A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed not later than 90 days after the date that decision was rendered, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2)(2002). In the instant case, the Board issued a decision in each of the respondents’ cases on April 29, 2002. A motion to reopen would therefore have been due on or before Monday July 29, 2002. As the respondents acknowledge, their motion was untimely where it was filed on August 13, 2002, approximately 2 weeks after it was due. The respondents, however, claim that the time period for the filing of their motion should be equitably tolled based on the reasoning of the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001). Specifically, they allege that they were unable to file a motion to reopen in a timely fashion due to the ineffective assistance of attorney David Neumeister, who represented them before the Board.
 
The respondents’ allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are unpersuasive. First, the respondents have failed to indicate how attorney Neumeister’s assistance was ineffective with regard to the filing of their motion. The lead respondent admits that attorney Neumeister provided him with notice of the decision issued by the Board, which the lead respondent received approximately 20 days after the decision was issued. See Motion to Reopen, attached Declaration of Ramon Portillo dated June 22, 2002 (“Declaration”). He also admits that attorney Neumeister gave him an appointment in July 2002, and, although he does not specify the date of that appointment in his declaration, the motion itself states it was “almost three months from the” date of the Board’s decision, thus indicating that the scheduled appointment was within the 90-day period for filing a motion to reopen. Motion to Reopen at 3, and attached Declaration. The respondents, however, chose not to keep that appointment, and sought other representation. The lead respondent admittedly met with new counsel approximately 5 weeks before a motion was due, yet failed to file a motion to reopen in a timely fashion. These facts alone in no way establish ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney Neumeister with regard to the filing of a motion to reopen before the Board.
 
*2 In Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000), a case cited by the respondent to justify failing to comply with the requirements that the Board set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), the Ninth Circuit stated that “the Lozada requirements are generally reasonable, and under ordinary circumstances the BIA does not abuse its discretion when it denies a motion to remand or reopen based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel where the petitioner fails to meet the requirements of Lozada.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra, at 525. As discussed above, this case does not revolve “a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel” so as to excuse the respondents from satisfying the formal requirements of Lozada. Id at 525-26. The respondents have failed to set forth with particularity what their agreement was with attorney Neumeister with regard to any representation he would provide after issuance of the Board’s decision, to present any evidence that they informed attorney Neumeister of the allegations leveled against him or provided him with an opportunity to respond, or to indicate whether a complaint was filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. In light of the failure to comply with Lozada and the failure to present a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance, the respondents have not established that the time period for filing their motion to reopen should be equitably tolled under applicable Ninth Circuit precedent. Accordingly, the motion was filed out of time and will be denied as untimely.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

It is unclear whether the lead respondent intended to include his spouse, Rafaela Portillo Valdovinos, or his son, Ramon Portillo Valdovinos, in the motion to reopen, where he lists in the heading of the motion to reopen only the A-numbers of his three children and not that of his spouse. Nevertheless, in view of our decision in this matter, we need not determine whether his spouse should also have been included in the motion.

Although the respondents also raise ineffective assistance of counsel claims with regard to the underlying merits of their motion, for purposes of our decision we need only address the claim relating to the timeliness of their motion to reopen.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: JUAN RAMOS
File: A73 479 251 - Newark
January 29, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Harlan G. York, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Charles Parker, Jr.
Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. An Immigration Judge issued an order of removal against the respondent on May 23, 2001. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of the Immigration Judge’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38. The appeal was filed over a year late, on October 4, 2002.
 
The respondent urges the Board to accept the appeal out of time. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service), in its brief, supports the decision of the Immigration Judge and takes no position on the untimely filing. The respondent claims that he trusted his former attorney, who represented him at the removal hearing, to file the appeal for him.1 However, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Xu Yong Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.2d 127, 132 (3d Cir. 2001)(Board’s requirements for making ineffective assistance of counsel claim are “a reasonable exercise of the Board’s discretion”). As for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, these cases require that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. There is no convincing evidence that either former counsel was notified of the charges, or that a disciplinary complaint was made against former counsel. Rather, attached to the Notice of Appeal was respondent’s letter to the Essex County, New Jersey bar association, saying that he wished to bring a complaint against former counsel, and a letter from a Supreme Court of New Jersey arbitration committee, to the respondent, sending him information about their arbitration program. There is no evidence that a disciplinary complaint with the proper authorities was filed against former counsel. Moreover, while former counsel was provided with a copy of the arbitration committee materials, there is no convincing evidence that former counsel was notified of the charges against him.
 
We also note that the respondent concedes in the Notice of Appeal that he learned no appeal was filed when he was ordered to report for removal. Yet the respondent states in his affidavit that he was ordered to report for removal in May, 2002. Nevertheless, the appeal was not filed for 5 months. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 127, 134-135 (2d Cir. 2000) (party seeking to extend filing deadline based on theory of equitable tolling must show that he has acted with due diligence).
 
*2 We therefore find that the appeal is untimely. The Immigration Judge’s decision is now final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.52, 1240.53, and 1241.31 (1999).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dobbs, Dawn, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Tilson, Allen Reid,
Assistant District Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated November 15, 2002, denying the respondent’s untimely motion to rescind an order entered in absentia on March 5, 2001, and to reopen the removal proceedings. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). See also sections 240(b)(5)(C) and 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I& N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001); Matter of Guzman, 22 I& N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999).
 
The respondent’s argument based on ineffective assistance of counsel is not supported as required under Matter of Lozada, 19 I& N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F. 2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Lara v. Trominski, 216 F. 3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000) (in agreement with requirements). Further, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the respondent entered into an attorney/client relationship with either Catholic Charities of Tennessee, Inc. or Attorney Evaristo Martinez before the in absentia order was entered. See Respondent’s Application for Adjustment of Status (Form I-693), dated July 4, 2001; see also electronic mail, dated December 4, 2002 (stating respondent met Mr. Martinez at a social gathering in March 2001 in Kentucky). Thus, the respondent’s argument fails.
 
The respondent claims she did not receive oral notice of the consequences of failing to appear at her removal hearing in her native language, Spanish. The record reflects, however, the respondent’s signature on the Notice to Appear (Form I-862) indicating that she was personally served the Notice to Appear on April 1, 1999, that she was provided a list of organizations and attorneys who provide free legal services to aliens, and that she was provided oral notice in the Spanish language of the time and place of her hearing and of the consequences of failure to appear as provided in section 240(b)(7) of the Act (Exh. 1). We are not persuaded by the respondent’s belated claim to the contrary not only because the respondent has not offered an affidavit or any other statement under penalty of perjury indicating that she did not sign the Notice to Appear voluntarily and of her own free will, but also because the respondent’s diligence in notifying the Immigration Court of her address changes, which is also discussed in the notice of the consequences of failing to appear at the hearing in the Notice to Appear, and her several pro se motions to change venue, belie the respondent’s claim that she did not understand the consequences of failing to appear at her removal hearing. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hernandez, Michael J.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 25, 2002. We concur with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not met the burden of proving statutory eligibility for the relief sought for the reasons set forth in the decision below. With respect to allegations of ineffective assistance by her former counsel in the Notice of Appeal, we find that the respondent has not established an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), which requires a detailed affidavit setting forth the agreement, an opportunity for the representative to respond to the allegation, and the filing of a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or an adequate explanation for the failure to file. See Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.2d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000), amended by 213 F.3d 1221 (9th Cir. 2000) (Lozada requirements generally reasonable unless facts relating to ineffective assistance claim apparent in the record). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the alien is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the alien fails to so depart, the alien shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the alien fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the alien shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondents appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated January 17, 2003, denying their motion to reopen removal proceedings.1 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge determined that the respondents failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel and, thus, denied their motion to reopen. On appeal, the respondents assert that they complied with the elements necessary to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as provided for in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
A motion to reopen based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representation counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and, (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003); cf. Matter of Lozada, supra, see also Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 132 (3rd Cir. 2000). Furthermore, the respondent must show that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance. See Matter of Assaad, supra.
 
In this case, the respondents failed to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. While the lead respondent submitted an affidavit, the affidavit fails to set forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representation counsel did or did not make to the respondent. The affidavit does not establish whether counsel represented the lead respondent, his employer, or both. The affidavit does not provide any details regarding: a fee arrangement; whether the lead respondent, counsel or employer actually filed the labor certification application; whether the respondent and employer cooperated with counsel in order to timely respond to the request by the New Jersey Department of Labor; or, whether any agreement between the lead respondent and counsel required counsel to file a labor certification application by the filing deadlines contained within section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). As such, the affidavit does not comply with the first prong of the Lozada requirements.
 
*2 While the lead respondent asserts that he complied with all the Lozada requirements and notified prior counsel of the allegations leveled against him and gave him an opportunity to respond, the record does not support his assertion. The motion to reopen is unaccompanied by any letter addressed to counsel informing him of the respondents’ allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. Likewise, the state bar complaint does not indicate that a copy was sent to counsel by the lead respondent. Furthermore, the lead respondent’s complaint to the state bar was drafted on November 18, 2002. The state bar complaint was received by the Board on November 20, 2002, only 2 days after it was drafted. Thus, prior counsel was not afforded any opportunity to respond to the allegations before the Board was provided a copy of the state bar complaint. Consequently, the lead respondent failed to comply with the second prong of the Lozada requirements.
 
The lead respondent has also failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by attorney John Hykel’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. In this case, the record very clearly reflects that the lead respondent retained the services of two additional counsel, John J. Seehousen and Michael Choi, following his initial representation by John Hykel. There is no evidence in the record establishing that the lead respondent informed John J. Seehousen or Michael Choi that he had filed an application for labor certification and that he needed assistance with that application. The respondent has not made any claim that John J. Seehousen’s representation was ineffective. While the lead respondent states in his affidavit that he thought Michael Choi should have assisted him with his second labor certification application, he has not complied with any of the Lozada requirements to establish that Michael Choi provided ineffective assistance of counsel. As such, the respondents have failed to comply with the requirements of Lozada regarding any of the respondents’ different counsel. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s decision is not erroneous.
 
The respondents also assert in their motion to reopen that they are seeking adjustment of status. A motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application and all supporting documentation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). However, the respondents have not submitted an application for adjustment of status or even established that they have filed a visa petition. Thus, the motion to reopen was properly denied by the Immigration Judge.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ appeal is dismissed.

The respondents have also submitted new evidence along with their appeal brief, however, they have not filed a motion to remand and we cannot consider any new evidence presented for the first time on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003(d)(3)(iv). This Board is an appellate body whose function is to review, not create a record. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (B1A 1984). Consequently, we will adjudicate the appeal based upon the evidence contained in the record when it was before the Immigration Judge.

File: A75 308 870 - Chicago

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael H. Said, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on June 10, 2003, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen finding that his ineffective assistance of counsel claims had not been established on this record. The respondent has submitted a motion to reconsider the Board’s June 10, 2003, decision.1 The motion is denied.
 
When deciding a motion to reconsider, the Board considers the case as though the decision in the case on the record before us had never been entered. If the respondent was eligible for relief at the time of the original decision, then in reconsidering the decision, we treat his status as that which it had been at the time of the initial decision. “The very nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard.” Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991). We have reviewed the record, as well as both the Immigration Judge’s and this Board’s prior decisions. We have considered the respondent’s allegations concerning ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). However, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s arguments that reconsideration is warranted on that basis, as a matter of discretion.
 
In his motion to reconsider, the respondent asserts that former counsel was to have filed a brief in support of his appeal but failed to do so. He contends that a properly filed brief would have raised key issues on appeal. Ineffective assistance of counsel in an immigration proceeding is a denial of due process only “¿iºf the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from presenting his case.” Ramirez-Durazo v. INS, 794 F.2d 491, 499-500 (9th Cir. 1986) (quoting Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1985). See also LeBlanc v. INS, 715 F.2d 685, 694 (1st Cir. 1983)(no need to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel where “¿tºhere has been no violation of fundamental fairness”). Examining the matter before us, we find that there has been no showing that the respondent was prejudiced by his attorney’s performance. See Mohsseni Behbahani v. INS, 796 F.2d 249 (9th Cir. 1986) (to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, one must show prejudice). The respondent has failed to identify what was omitted that would have been included in his brief that was not included in his Notice of Appeal (form EOIR-26) that would have addressed how the Immigration Judge erred in his decision. Failure to file a brief is not per se prejudice. See Matter of Assad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2002) (respondent did not establish that this former counsel’s failure to file a timely appeal constituted sufficient prejudice to warrant consideration of his late appeal on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lee P. Crystal
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on April 16, 2002, when we summarily affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision which had denied the respondent’s request for cancellation of removal. We granted the respondent a period of 30 days to voluntarily depart. On May 16, 2003, the respondent filed with this Board a motion to reopen and remand, claiming that ineffective assistance of counsel had prevented her from previously requesting a remand for an adjustment of status. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). She further maintains that because the individual who was assisting her allegedly did not provide her with notice of this Board’s 2002 decision, the voluntary departure period should be equitably tolled. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2.
 
The respondent maintains that she had married a United States citizen in 1999, shortly before the Immigration Judge denied her cancellation of removal claim.1 In a declaration accompanying her motion, the respondent stated that she retained the services of a “notary,” Judith Gill, for the preparation of the appeal. The respondent acknowledged that while she availed herself of Ms. Gill’s assistance during the prior proceedings, she retained an attorney to appear in Immigration Court. It is clear, from the respondent’s declaration that she understood that Ms. Gill was not an attorney, and that to be represented in Immigration Court the respondent knew she would have to retain someone with additional credentials.
 
Aside from the respondent’s failure to support her allegation that Ms. Gill defrauded her or made misrepresentations to her, Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (2002), we find that the respondent has not put forth an adequate claim under Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000). The respondent’s failure to notarize her own declaration or show that either the declaration or the complaint letter to Ms. Gill were actually sent or received, Reyes v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1126 (2003), is sufficient reason for us to conclude that the respondent has not put Ms. Gill on sufficient notice that her efforts have been challenged. We also note that while the complaint letter to Ms. Gill states that the respondent is pursuing legal action against Ms. Gill, the respondent has not submitted any evidence of this. Nor has the respondent shown that she has filed a grievance with any authorities, such as filing a complaint of unauthorized practice of law with the California State Bar. Id.
 
*2 More notably, however, the respondent stated in her declaration that, “Ms. Gill failed to advise me that I could have requested that the Board remand my case for the purpose of adjustment my status as early as December 2000.” This statement is contradicted by an earlier letter from the respondent. On November 6, 2000, the respondent sent correspondence to this Board, over her own signature, stating that she was married to a United States citizen and had been informed that she had to have her case remanded to the Immigration Court to adjust her status. She further indicated in the letter that an immigrant petition had been filed on her behalf, but she did not indicate the petition had been approved.2 In light of this letter, we find that we cannot give credence to the respondent’s Lozada declaration which alleges that Ms. Gill never informed her of such a procedure. Aside from the technical Lozada requirements, and aside from MS. Gill’s status as a non-attorney, without a credible declaration before us about what this representative did or did not do, we cannot conclude that the respondent was ineffectively represented.
 
Prior to our decision in Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002) (decided March 6, 2002), the respondent would not have been considered prima facie eligible to adjust her status as there was no evidence that the respondent’s visa petition had actually been approved. Accordingly, there was apparently nothing more for Ms. Gill to do for years after the appeal was filed, even assuming that the respondent had informed her that she had married a United States citizen. We are not inclined to find that Ms. Gill, a non-attorney, should have been aware of our decision in Matter of Velarde, supra, such that she should have known to file a motion to remand in the period of some 6 weeks between the March 6, 2002, publication of that case and our April 16, 2002, decision in this case. Moreover, there is still no evidence that Ms. Gill could have filed a successful motion which would have demonstrated the respondent’s prima facie eligibility for relief. The respondent, even now with new representation, has yet to show by clear and convincing evidence that there is a strong likelihood that her marriage is bona fide. Matter of Velarde, supra. We have no marriage certificate before us and we have no evidence, other than unsupported assertions, that the respondent’s husband is a United States citizen. This falls short of the requirements to overcome the statutory presumption that the marriage is fraudulent, and thus the respondent has failed to show prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. Id. Consequently, there is no basis for reopening proceedings.
 
*3 As we cannot credit the respondent’s statements about what transpired between her and Ms. Gill, we are not inclined to find that the time limit on filing motions was tolled, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c), or that the respondent should be equitably excused for failing to voluntarily depart. See section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d). In this regard, we observe that notwithstanding the Immigration Judge’s directions, the respondent apparently failed for years, including at the time our last decision was rendered, to properly notify the government of her current address (Tr. at 24-25).3 See Matter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996) (deportation proceedings context). Cf. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (equitable tolling may be available where alien is defrauded and where alien exercises due diligence). Thus, the respondent’s motion is untimely, and she is also ineligible to adjust her status because she failed to voluntarily depart within the time period previously provided.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

There is no indication that the respondent made any of her representatives or the Immigration Judge aware of this marriage before the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent has not alleged that she is entitled to cancellation of removal based upon any hardship that her United States citizen spouse might incur upon her removal. Nor does she maintain that failure to present such an argument either to this Board or to the Immigration Judge constituted ineffective assistance.

2

Presumably, because there was nothing to support this letter such as an approved visa petition, the Board did not construe it at the time to be a sufficient motion to remand.

3

The respondent, while indicating she was pro se when this case was last before us, used Ms. Gill’s return address for correspondence but did not inform either the Immigration Court or this Board of her own whereabouts.

File: A78 434 775 - Chicago
January 15, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard H. Trais, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Karen E. Lundgren
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent is appealing the Immigration Judge’s January 29, 2003, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings so that his in absentia order of removal may be rescinded. The Department of Homeland Security (“the DHS”) agrees with the Immigration Judge’s decision. See DHS’s Appeal Brief.
 
We affirm and adopt the Immigration Judge’s decision and with the following comments the appeal will be dismissed. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the ¿I ºmmigration ¿Jºudge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
The respondent argues that he did not receive notice of his January 9, 2002, hearing because his prior counsel, Ms. Sandra Greene, did not notify the Immigration Court of his new address in Chicago, Illinois. The respondent thus argues that he did not receive notice of the hearing because of his prior counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness, yet he has not complied with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for assessing whether an alien has established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Before we determine if an attorney’s representation was ineffective and affected the outcome of his case we require that an alien first provide (1) an affidavit detailing the agreement between the movant and counsel; (2) a showing that the allegations of ineffective assistance were communicated to counsel and that he or she was given an opportunity to respond to them; and (3) a statement as to whether a complaint was filed against counsel with the appropriate disciplinary authorities and if not why not. We note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the circuit in which this case arises, has approved of such requirements. See Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498 (7th Cir. 2001).
 
The respondent has complied with none of these requirements despite being aware of them. This case is exactly the sort of situation which demonstrates the need for an alien’s compliance with Lozada. While it appears that Ms. Greene mailed a copy of a Notice of Hearing to the respondent at an address different from that which the respondent provided to the DHS upon his release from administrative detention, there is absolutely no showing the Ms. Greene ever undertook any responsibility to inform the Immigration Court of his new address. The respondent simply argues that Ms. Greene should have so informed the court. However, we note that by that time, venue in the respondent’s case had changed to Chicago, Illinois, from York, Pennsylvania. It is possible that Ms. Greene informed the respondent that he needed to make the Immigration Court aware of his new address, especially if he had not already found new counsel in Chicago.1 However, we do not know what Ms. Greene’s view of her obligation to the respondent was, or what agreements she believed existed between them, because there is no indication that the respondent has ever formally informed her that he has challenged her effectiveness in his motion to reopen or in his appeal to this Board.2 Thus, there has been no reason for her to respond to the respondent’s allegations. We have been presented with the respondent’s side of the story only.
 
*2 As we find that the respondent has failed to establish that he did not receive notice of his hearing due to the ineffectiveness of his prior attorney, we find that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We note that the respondent’s current counsel did not provide any address for the respondent in the space provided on the Form EOIR-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance, when he undertook to represent the respondent before the Immigration Court on the motion to reopen.

2

The respondent’s current counsel alleges that he has tried “on numerous occasions” to contact Ms. Greene in this matter but never heard back from her. However, counsel’s statements are not evidence and there is no indication of the manner in which he tried to get in touch with her or the exact substance of his requests. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Certainly nothing has been presented in writing that would inform us that Ms. Greene is aware of the allegations made against her.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kraus, Karla L., Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). In a decision dated December 11, 2002, an Immigration Judge found that the respondent was removable from the United States pursuant to section 212(a)(2)(C) of the Act because there was reason to believe that the alien was a narcotic trafficker. The Immigration Judge made this finding primarily based upon the respondent’s statements provided to Inspector Guzman of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service, on September 14, 2001 (See Exh. 9). In the Notice of Appeal, the respondent argued that the written statement should not have been considered by the Immigration Judge because the officer did not testify at the hearing.
 
On this point, we note that in administrative proceedings the Federal Rules of Evidence are not controlling. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986); see also Martin-Mendoza v. INS, 499 F.2d 918, 922 (9th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1113 (1975); Matter of Grijalva, 19 I&N Dec. 713 (BIA 1988). An Immigration Judge may receive into evidence any oral or written statement which is material and relevant to any issue in the case made by the alien or any other person during any investigation or examination. Id. Such evidence may be admitted as long as it is probative and its use is fundamentally fair so as not to violate due process standards. Fisher v. INS, 79 F.3d 955 (9th Cir. 1995). We have reviewed exhibit 9, and find nothing fundamentally unfair about its admission into evidence. The respondent indicated therein that the information provided was being given freely and voluntarily, and was true. In addition, we agree with the Immigration Judge there is no showing of egregious circumstances which transgress the notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the probative value of the evidence in question. Id. at 1051 n.5. We therefore find no error on behalf of the Immigration Judge to rely upon exhibit 9 in determining that the respondent was removable from the United States.
 
In addition, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent did not merit a favorable exercise of discretion in his application for cancellation of removal. That aspect of the Immigration Judge’s decision is also affirmed. The respondent further argued on appeal that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has not, however complied with any of the procedural requirements for establishing this contention. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Reyes v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2003). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert F. Graziano, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
Lodged: Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact (withdrawn)
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration and Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on March 18, 2003, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) met its burden of establishing that the respondent abandoned her lawful permanent resident status and ordering the respondent’s removal. On April 17, 2003, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider alleging that the Immigration Judge erred in not properly considering evidence of her property in the United States and her claim that she signed the Form I-407 (Abandonment of Lawful Permanent Status) under duress. On June 16, 2003, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen seeking a remand due to ineffective assistance of counsel and her recent marriage to an United States citizen. The motion to reconsider is denied. The motion to reopen is granted.
 
First, we deny the respondent’s motion to reconsider because it fails to specify any errors of fact or law in the Board’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The respondent reiterates many of the same arguments that she already raised on appeal, and the Board considered those arguments but found no reason to reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision. In determining whether an alien has abandoned her lawful permanent resident status, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, under which jurisdiction the instant case arises, pointed out that the “relevant intent is not the intent to return ultimately, but the intent to return to the United States within a relatively short period.” See Singh v. Reno, 113 F.3d 1512, 1514 (9th Cir. 1997). Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit listed a range of factors to be considered in determining the alien’s intent, of which “property ties” is only one of the many factors. Id. at 1514-15. With regard to the respondent’s claim that she signed the Form I-407 under duress, we agree with the Immigration Judge that although the respondent testified that she did not voluntarily give up her lawful permanent resident status, the circumstances surrounding her signing of the form did not indicate evidence of duress. See Tr. at 86-94. For the above reasons, we find it necessary to deny the respondent’s motion to reconsider due to failure to specify any clear errors of fact or law in the Board or Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
*2 The respondent has also alleged in a motion to reopen that she received ineffective assistance of counsel from her former attorney, James Spirakis, Esquire. She has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 627 (BIA 1988), in that she has submitted an affidavit describing the agreement that was entered into with Mr. Spirakis and her complaints, she informed him of the allegations leveled against him through a letter and gave him an opportunity to respond, and she filed a complaint with the State Bar of California. See Motion to Reopen at Exhs. A and B. In the motion, the respondent claims that Mr. Spirakis did not properly develop the record of her property holdings, failed to timely submit documents to the Immigration Judge, failed to call one of her former husbands as a witness, and failed to produce evidence that another one of her former husbands, a Swedish national, had obtained a visa through the visa lottery in 1996. However, the Board has held that an alien is bound by the strategic decision of her counsel unless she can show that the counsel behaved so egregiously that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B- et al., 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998) (finding no ineffective assistance of counsel where the attorney’s insistence on corrborating evidence discouraged the aliens from applying for asylum). In our review of the record, we do not find that Mr. Spirakis’s representation rose the level of egregiousness envisioned in Matter of B-B-et al., supra.
 
Finally, the respondent seeks reopening to apply for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act based on her February 18, 2002, marriage to an United States citizen who has filed a visa petition on her behalf, relying on the Board’s decision in Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). With her motion, the respondent has submitted evidence regarding her marriage and a completed application for the relief sought. See Motion to Reopen at Exh. I. The DHS has filed no response to the motion. The motion to reopen to seek adjustment of status is granted.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is granted, proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal is untimely. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was rendered on August 4, 2003. The appeal was accordingly due on or before September 3, 2003. The record reflects that the Notice of Appeal was submitted to the Board of Immigration Appeals on September 5, 2003, but was rejected due to filing defects. The appeal was properly filed with the Board on September 25, 2003. Accordingly, we find the appeal is untimely as the record demonstrates that the appeal was not perfected within the requisite 30-day period. Also, we note from the Notice of Appeal that the respondents appear to be raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as the reason for the untimeliness of their appeal. The respondents have provided copies of payment receipts and mailing receipts to support their claim. However, in view of the evidence before us, we find that the respondents have not fully complied with the requirements as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); therefore, the Board need not address this issue. Thus far, we do not find this factor to be an adequate reason to accept this appeal by certification. The Immigration Judge’s decision is therefore now final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.
 
We note that because we have dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).

*1 PER CURIAM. On September 12, 2003, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s applications for relief, and the respondent reserved his right to appeal the decision. The respondent filed a Notice of Appeal on November 12, 2003. As the respondent recognizes, the appeal is untimely. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38.
 
The respondent urges the Board to accept the appeal out of time. The respondent blames an attorney for failing to file a timely appeal. However, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). As for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, Matter of Lozada, supra, requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
Here, there is no evidence that the respondent gave the attorney the opportunity to respond to the allegations of ineffectiveness. Matter of Lozada, supra. Although the attorney submitted an appearance form with the Board, and we therefore recognize him as appearing on the respondent’s behalf, all the papers submitted to the Board were apparently prepared by the respondent himself. There is no statement or affidavit from counsel, giving his version of events. We cannot adequately evaluate whether former counsel bore any responsibility for the late-filed appeal. Moreover, there is no evidence presented to show that a complaint was filed with the proper disciplinary authority.
 
We find that the appeal is untimely. The Immigration Judge’s decision is now final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.52, 1240.53, and 1241.31 (1999).

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John Ayala, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sandra B. Myles
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 On October 24, 2003, counsel for the respondent filed the instant motion, following our order dated September 24, 2003, in which we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen filed with the Board on April 3, 2003. The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition to the motion. The respondent has styled his motion as a “Motion to Reopen Pursuant to Matter of Lozada,” and argues that due to ineffective assistance by his prior counsel he was prejudiced, and that the numerical limitations on motions to reopen therefore should not apply in this case. Even assuming, arguendo, that the respondent has met all of the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988),1 he has failed to show that he was prejudiced by the actions of prior counsel.2 The respondent has not asserted that the actions of prior counsel prevented him from departing the United States voluntarily during the voluntary departure period provided by the Board, which formed the basis of the Board’s denial of his previous motion to reopen. More importantly, the respondent has failed to establish that he would now be successful on the merits of his claim for relief from deportation, such that reopening would be warranted.
 
An alien who seeks to remand or to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). The new evidence submitted by the respondent indicates that he is now married to a United States citizen, and is the father of a United States citizen child of tender years (age 1) who is apparently in good health.3 It is highly unlikely that consideration of this new evidence would result in a grant of suspension of deportation.4 The respondent has not shown that there is a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits if proceedings were reopened. See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000) (alien failed to show substantial likelihood that the result in the case would be changed if proceedings were reopened); see generally Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996).
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

In reaching our decision, we have considered that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that an alien need not fulfill all the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, to assert claim of ineffective assistance of counsel when the record reflects a clear and obvious case of such. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that attorney’s failure to timely file a suspension of deportation application was negligence). See also Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000). In the instant case, we are unable to find that a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel has been established.

Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 3367 (BIA 1998).

The respondent’s motion is accompanied by an affidavit by the respondent, a citizen of Mexico, stating that he married on July 15, 2001, while his wife was a lawful permanent resident, and that his wife became a naturalized United States citizen on May 28, 2003.

The respondent has not submitted an application for adjustment of status, and indeed, has stated that he is not seeking such relief in this motion to reopen (Respondent’s Response to Opposition, at 4).

File: A92 896 254 - Chicago
January 8, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Miryam Antunez de Mayolo, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied.1 The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on September 4, 2003. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not pertinent here), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before December 3, 2003. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until December 12, 2003. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time. This untimely filing is only the latest in a history of failure by the respondent to file items in a timely manner and failure to exercise due diligence in pursuing his claims to relief in the United States.
 
The respondent alleges that he received ineffective assistance from prior counsel. The respondent has failed to meet the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (requirements for establishing claim of ineffective assistance of counsel), in that he has failed to provide a detailed description of his agreement with Mr. Banwo, has failed to provide evidence that Mr. Banwo had an opportunity to reply to his allegations, and failed to provide proof that he filed a complaint with the state bar.2 The respondent has also failed to show that application of the principle of equitable tolling would be warranted in this case, as he has failed to show that he reasonably relied on counsel and that the respondent himself exercised due diligence in pursuing his case.
 
Even if we were to find ineffective assistance of counsel in this case, or to apply equitable tolling to consider the motion despite its untimeliness, we would deny the motion in the exercise of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The respondent has failed to exercise due diligence. He concedes that he was unable to communicate with prior counsel due to a language barrier, but it appears that he made no attempts whatsoever to bring his own interpreter or to obtain other assistance. It is also apparent that the respondent failed even to provide his most recent address to Mr. Banwo, the Immigration Court, or the Board. The respondent filed the instant motion when he received a “bag and baggage” letter from the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service), ordering him to report for removal on December 16, 2003. The respondent has failed to explain what he did in the intervening 4-1/2 years from the date of his removal order on July 13, 1999.
 
*2 The respondent has failed to submit any applications for relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). An alien who seeks to remand or to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). See also Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000) (alien failed to show substantial likelihood that the result in the case would be changed if proceedings were reopened); see generally Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996). To date, the respondent has failed to establish that he qualifies for registry, cancellation of removal, temporary protected status, NACARA relief, or any other form of relief from removal. Thus, he has failed to establish that reopening would be warranted in this case.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

Counsel for the respondent also calls this motion a “motion to remand,” citing to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4). That regulatory provision, however, refers to motions which were filed during the pendency of an appeal, which is not the situation presented here. In any case, we would deny a motion to remand in the exercise of discretion as well, for the reasons stated in this order.

APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has filed an opposition to the motion.
 
The respondent states that the Board’s order dated September 25, 2003, did not specify how the respondent failed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We will now clarify. The respondent failed to comply with any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra,1 in his motion to reopen filed with the Board on April 29, 2003. With his April 29, 2003, motion to reopen before the Board, the respondent did not submit any documents regarding his ineffective assistance of counsel claim; he only submitted documents relating to the respondent’s family and community ties. The respondent has not pointed to any other “errors” in our prior order. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1).
 
The respondent has asked that we reconsider our prior order. We have done so, and find that our prior order was correct and proper. We affirm our order dated September 25, 2003.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

IN RE: JUAN LARIN-ULLOA
File: AXX XX0 131 - Los Fresnos

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lisa S. Brodyaga, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sean D. Clancy
Assistant District Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on August 20, 2003, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion asserts that his case should be reopened and proceedings terminated. Specifically, the respondent argues that he has complied with the requirements to establish ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and, thus, his previous pleading admitting his conviction for aggravated battery is essentially not binding on the respondent. Secondly, the respondent asserts that he is not removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), because the Eighteenth Judicial District, District Court, of Sedgwick County, Kansas has amended his judgment nunc pro tunc to reflect a conviction under Kansas Statutes Annotated (K.S.A.) section 21-3414(a)(1)(C) rather than his original conviction under K.S.A. section 21-3414(a)(1)(A).
 
A motion to reopen based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representation counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and, (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003); cf. Matter of Lozada, supra, see also Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000). Furthermore, the respondent must show that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance. See Matter of Assaad, supra.
 
In this case, the respondent failed to comply with the the requirements set forth in Maner of Lozada, supra. While the respondent submitted an affidavit, the affidavit fails to set forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representation counsel did or did not make to the respondent. The affidavit merely asserts that the respondent had limited English language abilities and that he lacked knowledge of K.S.A. section 21-3414. As such, the affidavit does not comply with the requirements of the first prong of the Lozada requirements.
 
*2 The respondent also claims that he complied with the second prong of the Lozada requirements and notified prior counsel of the allegations leveled against him and gave him an opportunity to respond. However, the record does not support this assertion. The respondent’s letter to prior counsel was drafted on May 20, 2003. It was mailed to the Board on May 22, 2003, and received at the Board on May 27, 2003. As such, prior counsel was not afforded an opportunity to respond to the allegations before the Board was provided a copy of the letter. Furthermore, the respondent’s allegation that counsel admitted that the respondent had been convicted under K.S.A. section 21-3414(a)(1)(A) was erroneous is without merit. At the time of respondent’s immigration hearing, the respondent had been convicted under K.S.A. section 21-3414(a)(1)(A) as reflected in the certified judgment (Exh. 2). The respondent had not appealed the judgment and, thus, it was a conviction for immigration purposes. Moreover, the respondent cannot collaterally attack his conviction in immigration proceedings. See Zinnanti v. INS, 651 F.2d 420 (5 th Cir. 1981) (immigration authorities have no power to adjudicate the validity of state convictions underlying deportation proceedings). Thus, the respondent’s letter to prior counsel fails to satisfy the requirements of the second prong of the Lozada requirements.
 
Additionally, the respondent has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s admission of the conviction. The conviction was independently established when the Department of Homeland Security (“the DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) offered into the record a certified copy of the judgment (Exh. 2). The respondent did not appeal the conviction. In addition, a state conviction may not be collaterally attacked in immigration proceedings. See Zinnanti, supra. Thus, counsel for the respondent did not prejudice the respondent by admitting to the state conviction. Consequently, the respondent has failed to comply with the requirements of Lozada. See Matter of Assaad, supra. Accordingly, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails as a basis for reopening proceedings.
 
The respondent also asserts that the motion should be granted because the respondent’s prior conviction has been amended nunc pro tunc and his conviction under K.S.A. section 21-3414(a)(1)(C) is not an aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F). The respondent’s argument is without merit.
 
*3 While the respondent has submitted a copy of the amended judgment nunc pro tunc, the amended conviction constitutes a crime of violence under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, and thus, an aggravated felony. An aggravated felony is defined in section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 (a)(43)(F), as a crime of violence (as defined in section 16 of title 18, United States Code, but not including a purely political offense) for which the term of imprisonment is at least 1 year. Section 16 of Title 18 of the United States Code defines “crime of violence” to mean (a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or (b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
 
The judgment nunc pro tunc reflects that the respondent was convicted of aggravated battery under K.S.A. section 21-3414(a)(1)(C). Specifically, K.S.A. section 21-3414(a)(1)(C) provides that aggravated battery is “intentionally causing physical contact with another person when done in a rude, insulting or angry manner with a deadly weapon, or in any manner whereby great bodily harm, disfigurement or death can be inflicted.” Furthermore, aggravated battery as described in K.S.A. section 21-3414(a)(1)(C) is a felony. See K.S.A. § 21-3414(b). “While respondent argues that the respondent’s conviction falls under the latter part of K.S.A. section 21-3414(a)(1)(C), “or in any manner whereby great bodily harm, disfigurement or death can be inflicted,” the judgment nunc pro tunc clearly reflects that the respondent committed the aggravated battery with a firearm. See Matter of Sweetser, 22 I&N Dec. 709 (BIA 1999) (court may look to conviction records when statute is divisible). Thus, the respondent’s conviction falls under the part of the statute stating that “intentionally causing physical contact with another when done in a rude, insulting or angry manner with a deadly weapon.” Use of a deadly weapon while intentionally causing physical contact clearly involves a substantial risk that physical force against another person may be used. Consequently, the respondent’s conviction for aggravated battery is a crime of violence as defined under 18 U.S.C. §16(b). Furthermore, the respondent was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least 1 year as reflected in the judgment nunc pro tunc. Therefore, the respondent’s conviction constitutes an aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act and he is removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act.

Executive Office for Immigration Review
Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: MARBELLA MORALES GARCIA
File: AXX XX5 371 - Los Angeles
January 2, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On November 22, 2002, an Immigration Judge issued an order of removal against the respondent. The respondent filed a Notice of Appeal on November 10, 2003. The appeal is untimely. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38.
 
The respondent urges the Board to accept the appeal out of time. She claims that she trusted an individual, whom she thought to be an attorney, to file the appeal for her, but he did not file the appeal. The respondent fails to show prejudice resulting from her representative’s failure to file a timely appeal. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir.2003)(where alien deprived of direct appeal to Board, prejudice is presumed, but that presumption may be rebutted); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899-900, 901-03 (9th Cir. 2003)(respondent claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show prejudice); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
The respondent was found ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229b(b)(1). Her application for cancellation of removal reveals that the respondent is ineligible for such relief, as she does not have a qualifying relative. Section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act.
 
In her Notice of Appeal, the respondent appears to raise an equal protection challenge to the removal statute. She says that she wants to show how she is “similarly situated” to other immigrants, but has been treated different under current immigration laws. Perhaps she claims, as others have, that the statute denies equal protection of the law, in that she was unable to seek suspension of deportation under section 244(a) of the Act, in the context of her removal hearing, where similarly-situated aliens were able to seek such relief if placed into deportation proceedings prior to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub.L.No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (“IIRIRA”) taking effect. However, it is well-settled that the Board lacks the authority to rule on the constitutionality of the laws it administers. Matter of Fuentes-Campos, 21 I&N Dec. 905, 912 (BIA 1997).
 
*2 Accordingly, we find that the appeal is untimely. The Immigration Judge’s decision is now final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.

ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated December 30, 2002. The respondent argues that we should reopen proceedings because of her prior counsel’s ineffective assistance. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639, we held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the claim reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not.
 
The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration, and Naturalization Service) opposes the respondent’s motion because there is no evidence that the respondent’s former counsel has been informed of the charges against him and given an opportunity to respond. The respondent contends that his current counsel notified the prior counsel of the charges by telephone.
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the circuit in which this case arises, recently issued a decision regarding Lozada’s notice requirement. In Reyes v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2003), the alien sent a letter regarding the ineffectiveness of the alien’s prior counsel to the California State Bar. The letter included a line stating “cc” and the prior counsel’s name. Reyes v. Ashcroft, supra. The court observed that the “cc” notation, at best, indicated that the alien intended on sending the prior counsel notice of the state disciplinary proceedings, but that the respondent offered no evidence that he sent the prior counsel notice of the state disciplinary proceedings. Id. at 1131. Furthermore, the court noted that the alien failed to give the prior counsel notice of his motion to reopen. Id. at 1131-1132. The court emphasized that the purpose of Lozada’s notice requirement is to encourage the prior counsel to contest the allegations of ineffective assistance so that the adjudicator can more accurately assess the claim of ineffective assistance. Id at 1132. Inasmuch as the alien provided no evidence that the prior counsel received the notice of the motion to reopen and did not give the prior counsel an opportunity to respond to the allegations, the court held that the alien failed to comply with Lozada’s notice requirement. Id.
 
*2 In the instant case, neither the letter to the disciplinary authorities nor the motion to reopen indicate that a copy was sent to the respondent’s prior counsel. We also note that the respondent’s current counsel has not provided an affidavit regarding his telephone call to the respondent’s prior counsel. Therefore, we find that the mere assertion that notice was given without any other evidence is insufficient to establish that the respondent substantially complied with Lozada’s notice requirement. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, supra.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Juan Luis Burgos-Gandia, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James R. Vincent,
Assistant District Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We have jurisdiction over this timely appeal from the Immigration Judge’s April 15, 2002, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his case following a hearing held on February 13, 2002, in which the respondent was ordered removed in absentia. In the motion to reopen, filed March 20, 2002, the respondent’s counsel indicates that her office had relocated, and she did not receive the notice until March 19, 2002. An affidavit from counsel’s building manager corroborates this. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion, finding that notice to the respondent’s counsel was sufficient.
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia maybe rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances,1 because he did not receive proper notice of the time and place of the hearing, or because he was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. See Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. §3.23(b)(4)(ii)(1999). See also Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993).
 
The Immigration Judge correctly indicated that notice of hearing served on the attorney of record constitutes notice to the alien. See 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a). However, here it is undisputed that neither the respondent nor the respondent’s counsel received actual notice of the hearing before the hearing date. Though the Immigration Court did send the notice of the hearing to the last known address of the attorney of record, it is undisputed that the respondent’s attorney of record did not receive it because she moved without first notifying the Immigration Court of her new address.
 
Thus, the record reflects that, due to the respondent’s counsel’s negligence in informing the Immigration Court of her new address, the respondent was deprived of his right to a removal hearing. This clearly establishes ineffective assistance of counsel, which justifies reopening. While the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) argues that the respondent must comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), before being granted reopening, we find Matter of Lozada inapplicable here because the purpose of Lozada is to give attorneys notice of any claim of ineffective assistance being made against them. Here, the respondent’s current attorney of record is admitting the facts that constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 We also note that there is no evidence that either the respondent or counsel were intentionally abusing the immigration process here. The respondent’s counsel filed the motion to reopen only one day after she allegedly received the notice of the February 13, 2002, hearing, and only five weeks after the hearing itself. And, because he is statutorily eligible for adjustment of status, the respondent would have no reason to circumvent the immigration process.
 
The respondent married a United States citizen in 1999. A United States citizen was born of the marriage, so the bona fides of this marriage are not in question. The respondent’s spouse filed a visa petition (Form I-130) on the respondent’s behalf on April 9, 2001. That visa petition was approved on February 15, 2002. In the record of proceedings is a copy of the respondent’s marriage certificate, a Form I-797, reflecting approval of the Form I-130, and an application for adjustment of status (Form I-485).
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is sustained and proceedings are reopened, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for proceedings consistent with this decision.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

File: AXX-XX9-480 - LOS ANGELES
December 30, 2003
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gomez, Raul, Esq.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 15, 2002. On appeal, current counsel for the respondent asserts that the respondent was lead by misrepresentations of a notario and a lawyer working in concert with a notario to apply for cancellation of removal to which he was not entitled and that the respondent’s due process and constitutional rights have been violated. In support of this claim, the respondent has submitted additional evidence on appeal consisting of documents showing that James R. Valinoti, Esquire has been suspended from the practice of law and an assertion by counsel that attorneys who appeared on behalf of the respondent are “believed to be” associates in Mr. Valinoti’s firm. No personal affidavit has been submitted by the respondent in support of this contention of ineffective assistance by a notario or attorney. The respondent requests that proceedings be terminated sua sponte in the interests of justice.
 
We have not considered the additional evidence submitted by the respondent on appeal. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 1984). This evidence does not establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought and does not warrant a remand for further consideration by the Immigration Judge. To the extent that the respondent contends that his removal would be unconstitutional or violate due process, we note that the Board is not empowered to rule on the constitutionality of the statutes and regulations that we administer. See Matter of C-, 20 I&N Dec. 529, 532 (BIA 1992); Matter of Valdovinos, 18 I&N Dec. 343 (BIA 1982). We find that the respondent had a full and fair hearing and that the respondent has not established an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), which requires a detailed affidavit setting forth the agreement, an opportunity for the representative to respond to the allegation, and the filing of a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or an adequate explanation for the failure to file. See Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000), amended by 213 F.3d 1221 (9th Cir. 2000) (Lozada requirements generally reasonable unless facts relating to ineffective assistance claim apparent in the record). The respondent has not alleged or shown that he is eligible for any relief from removal other than voluntary departure, which was granted below. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
*2 FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the immigration Judge and the statute, the alien is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the alien fails to so depart, the alien shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the alien fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the alien shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Elsie V. Hui, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jean Lin-Stevens
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reissuance of decision
 
*1 On June 23, 2003, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent moves the Board to reissue that decision. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent retained present counsel to file a petition for review of the Board’s June 23, 2003, decision before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit received the petition for review on July 24, 2003, which was one day late and dismissed the petition as untimely.
 
The respondent filed the instant motion on October 14, 2003. With certain exceptions not relevant here, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the administratively final order. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion as untimely. Moreover, the DHS contends that the respondent did not comply with the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set down in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Even assuming that the respondent’s counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file a timely petition for review in the Ninth Circuit, this Board cannot remedy ineffective assistance of counsel in a court of appeals. Whatever remedy the respondent has should be pursued in another forum in the federal court system. The Board has on occasion reissued its decisions, but only due to Board error or administrative problems involving receipt of the Board’s decision. In the instant case the respondent does not allege any Board error or any issue involving receipt of the Board’s decision.
 
Accordingly, we shall not sua sponte grant the respondent’s motion to reissue pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). See Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (sua sponte reopening is limited to exceptional circumstances).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Malcolm B. Gerber, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Karen E. Lundgren
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration and reopening
 
In a decision dated February 4, 2003, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider his previous decision dated January 13, 2003, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent has appealed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On April 19, 2002, an Immigration Judge entered an order of removal against the respondent. The respondent submitted a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of his prior counsel. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on January 13, 2003, because the motion was not timely filed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Moreover, even assuming there was some type of equitable tolling, the respondent failed to comply with the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set down in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498, 501-02 (7th Cir. 2001); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
The respondent subsequently filed a motion to reconsider, which the Immigration Judge denied on February 4, 2003. The Immigration Judge construed the motion to reconsider to be one to reopen since it attached documents in an attempt to belatedly comply with Matter of Lozada. We agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision. These attached documents could have been produced in the earlier motion. The motion to reconsider was actually one to reopen. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991) (discussing the difference between motions to reopen and reconsider). Therefore, the respondent’s second motion exceeded the numerical limitations for motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Furthermore, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s analysis that even if the second motion was one to reconsider, the respondent failed to comply with reconsideration standards. The respondent failed to show that the Immigration Judge erred in denying the motion to reopen.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Linda A. Dominguez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This record was last before us on February 20, 2003, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s January 25, 2002, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings so that his in absentia order of removal may be rescinded. On August 26, 2003, the respondent filed a motion to reopen his proceedings with the Board. The Department of Homeland Security (“the DHS”) opposes the motion on timeliness grounds and also opposes it on its merits. See DHS’s “Opposition of the United States Department of Homeland Security to Respondent’s Motion to Reopen.”
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen should have been filed within 90 days of our previous decision upholding the denial of his motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (2003).1 The respondent’s motion was filed more than 6 months after we issued our prior order. Accordingly, we will deny such motion as it was untimely flied.
 
However, even if we were to consider the respondent’s motion on the merits, it would still be denied. The respondent now asserts that his prior counsel, Mr. Edward K. Fogam, represented him ineffectively before the Immigration Court. The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements governing ineffective assistance of counsel arguments found in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). However, we do not find the respondent to have persuasively shown that Mr. Fogam’s representation was ineffective, or even it was, that he was prejudiced by such representation.
 
As noted by the DHS in its opposition, Mr. Fogam apparently still represents the respondent in his appeal of our prior order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. See DHS’s Opposition at 3; see also Mr. Fogam’s Respondent to Maryland Bar Counsel, dated August 14, 2003. In addition, the respondent has not persuasively explained why he failed to appear for his December 19, 2001, Immigration Court hearing. The respondent’s attendance at such hearing was not excused simply because Mr. Fogam had filed a motion to continue the respondent’s proceedings. See Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260, 262 (BIA 1985), aff’d, Patel v. INS, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986). Although the respondent claims that Mr. Fogam never advised him to attend his master calendar hearing, Mr. Fogam asserted in response to such accusation that he did tell the respondent he had to attend, even though he (Mr. Fogam) was going to be out of the country on that date on business. See Respondent’s Memorandum to Maryland Bar Counsel, dated September 26, 2003; Mr. Fogam’s Letters to Maryland Bar Counsel, dated October 21, 2003, and August 14, 2003. The respondent has submitted no other evidence, such as a written communication between Mr. Fogam and him, to establish that Mr. Fogam advised him not to attend his hearing. Moreover, the Notice to Appear, Form I-862, which was mailed to him by the DHS, clearly informs him of the consequences in the event he failed to appear for his hearing. The respondent did not contest that he received such notice. Accordingly, we do not find that the respondent has established that Mr. Fogam’s representation caused his failure to attend his Immigration Court hearing or that he was prejudiced by any statements Mr. Fogam may have made to him.
 
*2 Accordingly, for the reasons described above, the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent was allowed 180 days under the regulations to file his motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge as he was seeking such reopening after he had been ordered removed to Cameroon in absentia, and the respondent did file such motion timely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(iv)(2). The respondent has only 90 days, however, after our prior order in which to file his motion to reopen with the Board.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frederick P. S. Whang
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on November 6, 2003, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 14, 2003, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered in her case on September 10, 2002, on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has submitted a timely motion entitled “motion for reconsideration,” in which she asserts that she now has sufficient “evidence” to meet the criteria set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The motion will be denied.
 
When deciding a motion to reconsider, the Board considers the case as though the decision in the case on the record before us had never been entered. If the respondent was eligible for relief at the time of the original decision, then in reconsidering the decision, we treat her status as that which it had been at the time of the initial decision. “The very nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard.” Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991). We have reviewed the record, as well as both the Immigration Judge’s and this Board’s prior decision. In the current motion, the respondent largely attempts to reiterate arguments already made in connection with her previous motion and already evaluated and rejected by this Board. A motion to reconsider is not a substitute for an appeal. It is not to be used as an opportunity for a second effort at proving factual allegations. See Matter of Guevara, 20 I&N Dec. 238 (BIA 1991); see also Matter of Cerna, supra. We are not persuaded by the respondent’s contentions that our prior decision was either legally, or factually, erroneous. The respondent has failed to demonstrate that reconsideration is warranted on that basis.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Mayra L. Calo, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on February 26, 2002. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before May 28, 2002. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until October 9, 2003. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time.1
 
In their motion, the respondents have raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, explaining that they were ill-advised by Catholic Charities Legal Services to appear at their immigration proceedings pro se. A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. In addition, the motion must establish prejudice arising from the alleged failings of prior counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). We note the respondents have failed to show that Catholic Charities’ actions had such an adverse effect that respondents’ hearing before the Immigration Judge would have resulted in an otherwise favorable outcome. It is also noted that respondents were represented during the pendency of their appeal by Catholic Charities Legal Services, and that none of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, have been met.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

Respondents state the Board rendered its decision without setting a briefing schedule, and did not send a copy of its order to them. A review of the record indicates that a briefing schedule was indeed set in this matter, and that the Board’s order was mailed to them by way of their then counsel of record, Claire R. White of Catholic Charities Legal Services, and that it was not returned as undeliverable by the postal service.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent in the instant case has filed a document titled “Motion to Reconsider Decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals.” Due to its content, it will be construed as a motion to reopen. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on December 3, 2002. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before March 3, 2003. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until September 5, 2003 The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time.
 
In his motion, the respondent has raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, stating her former attorney did not notify her that the Board had rendered its decision. A review of the record reveals that no EOIR-27 (Notice of Entry of Appearance As Attorney Or Representative Before the Board of Immigration Appeals Executive Office For Immigration Review) was filed on respondent’s behalf. Consequently, the Board’s order was mailed directly to respondent at her last known address, and it was not returned as undeliverable.
 
We note further that a motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. In addition, the motion must establish prejudice arising from the alleged failings of prior counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent here has failed to meet these requirements.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Scott Bratton, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
  
APPLICATION: Reopening.
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on March 21, 2003, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings, alleging ineffective assistance by his former counsel. The respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
The respondent has substantially complied with the requirements enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, we do not find that he has established that his former counsel’s failure to pursue a waiver, under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, violated his due process rights. See Huicochea-Gomez v. INS, 237 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2001) (finding that the failure to be granted discretionary relief does not amount to deprivation of a liberty interest). Specifically, the respondent has not established that, but for his former counsel’s advice regarding waivers, and his failure to apply for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver, he would have been “entitled to continue residing in the United States.” Id. at 699. Hence, we do not find that the respondent has adequately established that his case warrants reopening due to ineffective assistance of counsel. Id.
 
Furthermore, we find that the respondent’s motion to reopen for 237(a)(1)(H) relief warrants denial as a matter of discretion. In this regard, we note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in which jurisdiction the instant case arises, upheld a decision by this Board which stated that neither the courts nor the Board have “been lenient toward aliens who have flouted our immigration laws by engaging in fraudulent marriages to United States citizens or lawful permanent residents.” See Dallo v. INS, 765 F.2d 581, FN7 (6th Cir. 1985). Congress has emphatically expressed its disapproval of such conduct by the enactment of section 204(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c), which precludes from immediate relative or preference status any alien who has previously entered, or attempted or conspired to enter, into a sham marriage for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit. Id. Here, the respondent not only attempted to adjust his status based on a fraudulent marriage, but he subsequently committed a further fraud by applying for a visa and indicating that he had never previously attempted to procure a visa or other documentation through fraud. See I.J. at 3; see also Exh. 2, allegation #4 (found). Thus, as the respondent has repeatedly disregarded United States immigration laws, and as Congress has denied preference status to aliens in similar circumstances who are outside the United States, it is reasonable to require the respondent to demonstrate substantial equities to warrant reopening of his removal proceedings. See Dallo v. INS, supra, at FN7. Mere statutory qualification for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver should not suffice. Id. We do not find that the respondent, in this case, has demonstrated such substantial equities.
 
*2 Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Russell W. Miller, Jr., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF SERVICE:
 
Wealthia M. Rodriguez,
Assistant District Counsel
*1 In an order dated July 31, 2002, an Immigration Judge issued an in absentia decision, directing the respondent’s removal to Mexico. The respondent claims that he did not receive notice of the hearing. Through counsel, the respondent filed an “appeal” of the decision. We note that this is the second time that the respondent has been the subject of an in absentia order. See our orders of January 31, 2001; and February 7, 2002.
 
We lack jurisdiction to consider this “appeal.” An in absentia order, in circumstances such as this, may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen showing that the respondent did not receive notice of the hearing, or showing that he was in Federal or State custody, and the failure to appear was through no fault of his. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii).
 
Consequently, should the respondent choose to challenge the Immigration Judge’s decision, he must file a motion to reopen, demonstrating that he did not receive notice of the July 31, 2002, hearing, as he now alleges. The respondent will have the burden of explaining in his motion why his counsel appeared at the hearing and he did not, and why the provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5 and our holding in Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (notice to counsel constitutes notice to the alien), should not apply to him. Any motion based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel should comply with our holding in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent now appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings. We will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the respondent’s motion.
 
This case was last before the Board when, on July 13, 2001, we remanded the case to the Immigration Judge to afford the respondent an opportunity to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). The record reveals that on November 28, 2001, the respondent appeared before the Immigration Judge without counsel and without an application for the section 212(c) waiver. The Immigration Judge then continued the proceedings to permit the respondent to return with counsel, and to submit the proper application. When the respondent’s counsel failed to appear for the scheduled hearing on November 30, 2001, and the respondent again failed to submit the proper application, the Immigration Judge deemed the application to be abandoned, and ordered the respondent removed to Mexico.
 
The respondent, through current counsel, filed a motion to reopen the proceedings on August 13, 2003, and the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposed the motion. On January 21, 2003, the Immigration Judge denied the motion on the ground that it was untimely filed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (February 28, 2003). In reaching his decision, the Immigration Judge noted that the circumstances of this case fail to correspond to the regulatory exceptions to the temporal limitation imposed on motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R § 1003.23(b)(4). This appeal followed.
 
On appeal, the respondent reiterates his argument, first put forth in the motion to reopen, that he was the victim of the ineffective assistance of his former attorney during the reopened proceedings in November 2001. According to the respondent, he appeared at the Immigration Court with his former attorney on November 30, 2001, but the attorney left the respondent, with assurances that he would return for the hearing, outside the court room prior to the hearing. The respondent also claims that an unidentified individual, who represented himself to the respondent as an attorney working on the case, appeared with the respondent at the November 30, 2001, hearing, and thereafter instructed the respondent to contact his former attorney with regard to an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent further asserts that his former attorney instructed him to pay a $120 filing fee for the appeal, and that he paid the fee. The respondent also asserts on appeal that the Immigration Judge failed fully to consider the documentation submitted in support of the motion.
 
*2 We note that the Immigration Judge correctly concluded that the respondent’s motion was untimely filed, and that the circumstances of this case fail to correspond to the regulatory exceptions under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4). The regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b), however, provides, in pertinent part, that “[a]n Immigration Judge may upon his or her own motion at any time (emphasis added) … reopen or reconsider any case in which he or she has made a decision.” Given the particular circumstances of this case, we find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
The Ninth Circuit has held that ineffective assistance of counsel may constitute exceptional circumstances for the failure to file a timely motion to reopen. See Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934 (9th Cir. 2003). In the present case, we find that the respondent has substantially complied with the procedural requirements et forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.1 See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). Although the respondent filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, we note that the respondent’s former attorney has not responded to the complaint. We find it curious, however, that the respondent’s former attorney, who previously represented the respondent at the removal hearings before the Immigration Judge, informed the respondent’s current attorney on August 6, 2002, that his office “does not have the file for (the respondent).”
 
The Ninth Circuit has held that the statute of limitations for filing a motion to reopen is tolled from the time that an alien has been victimized by a negligent attorney until he learns of the negligence. See Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). In the present case, the respondent claims that he learned that his former attorney failed to file an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s November 30, 2001, decision, when, on July 25, 2002, he received instructions to present himself for removal. The record reveals that the respondent subsequently engaged his present attorney, and he filed the motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge on August 13, 2002.
 
The respondent has substantially complied with the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and he has shown that he filed the motion to reopen within 90 days of the date on which he claims to have learned of his former attorney’s negligence. If the respondent’s failure to file a timely application for the section 212(c) waiver, and his failure to file a timely Notice of Appeal, were the result of his former attorney’s misconduct, the respondent would have suffered prejudice as a result of the attorney’s mishandling of this case. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). In light of these factors, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the respondent’s motion to reopen. Upon remand, the Immigration Judge will have an opportunity to fully consider the documentation submitted in support of the motion, and to render a new decision. If the Immigration Judge renders a decision favorable to the respondent, the respondent will again have the opportunity to apply for the waiver of inadmissability under section 212(c) of the Act pursuant to our July 13, 2001, order.
 
*3 The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

IN RE: GEORGE LEGASPI MIOTEN
File: A38 562 921 - Buffalo
December 3, 2003
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anne E. Doebler, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carla J. Hengerer
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)] - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Termination; relief under section 212(c)
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge dated March 5, 2002. In that decision, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent was inadmissible on the basis that he had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.1 The Immigration Judge further found that the respondent had abandoned his application for relief under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), when he failed to file that application by September 24, 2001, the date previously set as the filing deadline. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the crime at issue, “felonious restraint” in violation of title 9, section 22.30 of the Guam Code, is divisible, and that the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) failed to establish that the respondent pled guilty to that portion of the statute that may be a crime involving moral turpitude. We have held that moral turpitude refers generally to conduct that is inherently base, vile, or depraved, and contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general. See Matter of L-V-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 594 (BIA 1999); Matter of Tran, 21 I&N Dec. 291 (BIA 1996). A conviction for unlawful restraint requires a showing that one has acted “knowingly” and that he either restrained another person exposing that person to risk of serious bodily injury, or that he held another person in conditions of involuntary servitude. See title 9, section 22.30 of the Guam Code. We conclude that a conviction under either aspect of this statute involves a motive that is both vicious and corrupt, and violates the duties owed between persons, and therefore, is a crime involving moral turpitude. Moreover, the record clearly establishes that the respondent pled guilty to the third charge listed in the indictment in his case. The third charge states that the respondent knowingly restrained another unlawfully in circumstances exposing her to risk of serious bodily injury in violation of 9 G.C.A. § 22.30(a). The respondent appears to acknowledge that a violation of subsection (a) of § 22.30 constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude. For these reasons, we find no merit to the respondent’s argument concerning the statute’s divisibility.
 
*2 The respondent also contends that he should be allowed to apply for a waiver of inadmissiblity under section 212(c) of the Act. The record establishes that on July 25, 2001, the Immigration Judge set September 24, 2001, as the filing deadline for the respondent’s section 212(c) application (Tr. at 11). The application was never filed. At the March 5, 2002, hearing, the respondent was represented by new counsel who advised the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s prior counsel was no longer employed at the legal agency that was representing the respondent, and further that prior counsel had failed to note in the respondent’s file that his section 212(c) application was due on September 24, 2001 (Tr. at 14-16). Counsel requesteda continuance to allow the application to be filed, and the request was denied (Tr. at 15-16). On appeal, the respondent contends that he should still be allowed to file a section 212(c) application because he previously received ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, supra, we held that such claims require: (1) an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the respondent state whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id.
 
In the instant case, the respondent has not submitted an affidavit or filed a complaint with the bar association against his former attorney. He has not offered any explanation as to why he did not file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. See Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108 (2d Cir. 1993) (finding that alien gave a reasonable explanation for why he did not file a complaint with the disciplinary authority). He has also not provided any evidence that proves he would have been granted a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) had his former counsel submitted the application to the Immigration Court. Based upon this lack of proof, we are unable to find that the respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements for proving that he was ineffectively represented or was prejudiced by his former attorney in these proceedings.
 
*3 On appeal, the respondent challenges the fact that he was charged as an alien seeking admission to the United States under section 101(a)(13) of the Act, even though he was a lawful permanent resident of the United States. To the extent that the respondent challenges our decision in Matter of Collado, 21 I&N Dec. 1061 (BIA 1998), we decline to revisit that decision. To the extent that the respondent challenges the constitutionality of section 101(a)(13) of the Act, this Board has no authority to rule upon the constitutionality of the laws we administer. See Matter of Valdovinos, 18 I&N Dec. 343 (BIA 1982).
 
Finally, we observe that in the Immigration Judge’s oral decision, as well as in his written order, the respondent was ordered removed to Guam. However, the respondent is a native and citizen of the Philippines, and the country designated for removal at the respondent’s hearing was the Philippines (Tr. at 10). The Immigration Judge’s order will, therefore, be corrected so as to order the respondent removed to the Philippines.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s country of removal is amended from “Guam” to “the Philippines.”

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

Susan Egan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on July 7, 2003, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider. On August 13, 2003, the respondent filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, and requesting the termination of proceedings on the basis that he is a United States citizen. On September 25, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) filed a response requesting a remand to the Immigration Court for an evidentiary hearing. The respondent’s motion will be granted. The DHS’ motion is granted.
 
In support of his motion, the respondent submitted, inter alia, photocopies of his birth certificate, his United States passport, his Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration Form (Form I-73) and his mother’s naturalization certificate. Specifically, the respondent contends that he “automatically acquired citizenship pursuant to former § 321 upon his mother’s [n]aturalization when he was 16-years-old” (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 3). Additionally, the respondent asserts that his former counsel’s failure to recognize the respondent’s aforementioned acquisition of United States citizenship materially prejudiced his case (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 10-13). We note that the respondent filed evidence that he complied with each of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Through its motion, the DHS disagrees with the respondent’s contention that he is a United States citizen. Specifically, the DHS asserts that the respondent was not able to solely derive citizenship through his mother. Additionally, the DHS argues that it is possible that the United States passport was issued to the respondent in error. Accordingly, the DHS requests that we remand this matter to the Immigration Court for an evidentiary hearing.
 
A motion to reopen must state “new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent must also establish his prima facie eligibility for the requested relief. A motion to remand is governed by the same regulatory requirements that govern motions to reopen. See Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000).
 
In light of the evidence of record, the facts show that it is worthwhile to develop the issues at a hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Accordingly, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for a full evidentiary hearing. The following orders will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The DHS’ motion to remand is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with this order.

In a decision dated July 23, 2002, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and ordered her removed from the United States. The respondent has appealed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent married a United States citizen who filed a visa petition on her behalf. The respondent also filed an application for permanent residence. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (now the Department of homeland Security “DHS”) issued a Notice of Intention to Deny the visa petition on July 2, 1999. The DHS observed numerous discrepancies between the respondent’s and her husband’s interviews. The respondent’s husband did not respond and on January 5, 2000, found the marriage was not bona fide and denied the visa petition. The respondent’s application for permanent residence was also denied.
 
On appeal the respondent blames the inactions of two former attorneys who she claims represented her during the visa petition proceedings. The respondent sought a further continuance to adjudicate a second visa petition, and the Immigration Judge denied the motion. The immigration Judge noted that the respondent had failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, and she had waited over one year and seven months since she was placed in removal proceedings to file her visa petition. (Tr. at 18). An Immigration Judge, in his discretion, may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. Based upon the facts, we find that the Immigration Judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion for another continuance due to the delay in filing the second visa petition and the fact that the DHS had already denied the first one.
 
The respondent also claims that prior attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has apparently filed bar complaints against two attorneys. However she has failed to comply with any of the other requirements. As we stated in Matter of Lozada, at 639, “before allegations of ineffectiveness are presented to the Board, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond. Any subsequent response from counsel, or report of counsel’s failure or refusal to respond should be submitted with the motion” (emphasis added). We noted that the high standard which we enunciated was necessary if the Board is to have a basis for assessing the substantial number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that come before us. Id. The respondent did not submit an affidavit and lay out the agreement between the parties, and the respondent did not give these attorneys the opportunity to respond to the allegations made against them. Finally, the respondent has not shown that she was prejudiced by their representation. The respondent has not established that the DHS erred in denying the visa petition and adjustment application.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: MEI CHUNG OU
File: A76 280 000 - Los Angeles
November 28, 2003
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL/MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Wellington Y. Kwan, Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julia C. Chimarusti
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On November 5, 2001, an Immigration Judge issued an order of removal against the respondent. The respondent filed a Notice of Appeal over a year and a half later, on August 12, 2003. As the respondent recognizes, the appeal was filed very late. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the respondent’s motion that the Board accept the untimely appeal.
 
The respondent’s motion blames a legal “service center”, and an attorney, for the late submission of the notice of appeal. He claims that representatives of the service center told him that an appeal had been filed, and he did not learn otherwise until July, 2003. This case arises within the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. That court has determined that time and numerical limitations on motions to reopen may be equitably tolled, based on actions taken by non-attorneys purporting to provide legal representation in immigration cases. Fajardo v. INS, 300 F.3d 1018, 1020-22 (9th Cir. 2002); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 2000). However, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988)(as reaffirmed by Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003)). See Fajardo v. INS, supra, at 1020-21; Varela v. INS, supra, at 1239; Lopez v. INS, supra; at 1100. Specifically, the respondent did not give the “service center” or the attorney the opportunity to respond to his allegations. Fajardo v. INS, supra, at 1021, fn.5, citing Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639.
 
We acknowledge that in Dearinger ex rel. Volkova, 232 F.3d 1042, 1045-56 (9th Cir. 2000), the court found that prejudice is presumed in a situation where counsel filed an appeal with that court 1 day late. See also Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 482 (2000) (holding that “counsel’s constitutionally deficient performance depriv[ing] a defendant of an appeal that he otherwise would have taken” establishes a “successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim entitling him to an appeal” without any additional showing of prejudice). However, given the respondent’s failure to give his former representatives the chance to respond to the allegations, we are unable, to evaluate the culpability of the representative for the late filing in this case.
 
*2 Accordingly, we find that the appeal is untimely. The Immigration Judge’s decision is now final, and the records are returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Imdad A. Seehar, Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mark Evans
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on July 28, 2003, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 31, 2003. The respondent has now timely moved to reopen the proceedings and remand to the Immigration Court for the presentation of new evidence on the basis of ineffective assistance of previous counsel. We observe the respondent’s motion was properly served on the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service), and the DHS has indicated its opposition to this motion. The motion will be granted and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
 
It appears the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (e.g., copy of grievance complaint filed with the State Bar of Texas, copy of agreement as to fees and work to be performed, etc.), and demonstrated the actions of the previous counsel below precluded him from fully presenting or developing his claim below resulting in prejudice requiring reopening of the proceedings. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2001). At the January 15, 2003, hearing the Immigration Judge had informed respondent’s counsel that he should be present on January 31, 2003, or submit reasons to the court for his absence along with evidence that he had cases scheduled elsewhere (Tr.at11). The respondent’s counsel filed a motion to continue on January 30, 2003, the day before the scheduled hearing, that was not accompanied by evidence of counsel’s scheduling conflicts. When the respondent appeared without counsel at his January 31, 2003, hearing, without a withholding application that was to have been prepared by his attorney, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had abandoned this and all other forms of relief and ordered him removed from the United States. In our decision, the Board noted that even after the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent’s counsel failed to provide any reasons for the failure to file the application as directed. On this record, we find support for the respondent’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that precluded him from fully presenting or developing his claim for relief, so as to warrant reopening of the proceedings.
 
Furthermore, we are not persuaded by the DHS’ other arguments in opposition to the respondent’s motion. Initially, we determined in Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002), that a properly filed motion to reopen for adjustment of status based on a marriage entered into after the commencement of proceedings may be granted in the exercise of discretion. Consequently, although the respondent’s pending immediate relative visa petition filed with the DHS remains unadjudicated, the presentation of clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood that the marriage is bona fide will not preclude granting of the requested relief. In addition, as the respondent had a previous immediate relative visa petition filed on his behalf terminated by divorce while his application for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act was pending, the regulations provide that he is a “grandfathered alien” and his new application under section 245(i) of the Act will be considered timely based on circumstances that have arisen after the time of filing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.10.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s July 28, 2003, is vacated, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

IN RE: EZEQUIEL MIRAMONTES-ARTEAGA
File: AXX XX9 677 - Los Angeles
November 25, 2003
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
J. Thomas Logan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jean Lin-Stevens
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; section 212(c) waiver
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s March 17, 2003, decision denying his motion to reopen deportation proceedings. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7) (2003). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On January 13, 1998, the respondent was ordered deported by an Immigration Judge based on his 1994 conviction of a drug trafficking aggravated felony. It appears that the Immigration Judge also pretermitted the respondent’s request for a waiver of deportability under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), based upon the Attorney General’s decision in Matter of Soriano, 21 I&N Dec. 516, 533 (A.G. 1997). No appeal was filed with this Board from the Immigration Judge’s decision and it appears that the final deportation order was executed.
 
On January 24, 2003, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge in which he argued that the January 1998 order was issued in derogation of his right to a fair hearing because the Immigration Judge (1) erroneously concluded that his 1994 criminal conviction involved an aggravated felony; (2) failed to inform him of his right to seek a section 212(c) waiver; and (3) led him to believe that it would be futile to file an appeal. Accordingly, the respondent requested an opportunity to submit an application for a section 212(c) waiver. The Immigration Judge denied the motion as untimely under both the general motions regulations and the particular regulations governing applications for section 212(c) relief filed by aliens with final orders of deportation. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1) and 1003.44(f). Although not entirely clear, it also appears that the motion was barred because it was filed after the respondent’s physical departure from the United States under a final order of deportation — an act which brought the deportation proceedings to a close. Cf. Matter of Okoh, 20 I&N Dec. 864, 865 (BIA 1994).
 
On appeal, the respondent does not challenge the Immigration Judge’s decision on its face, but instead argues for the first time that both his 1998 deportation proceedings and his 2003 proceedings with respect to the motion to reopen were tainted by ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he asserts that the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Judge in 1998 negligently failed to file an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision, and that this failure prejudiced the respondent in light of the Supreme Court’s subsequent decision in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). Moreover, the respondent appears to argue that the attorney who filed his motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge in January 2003 was ineffective when he failed, in the motion, to raise the issue of prior counsel’s ineffectiveness.
 
*2 The respondent concedes that he has not complied with the threshold procedural requirements governing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in immigration proceedings, as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Respondent’s Opening Brief at 8. However, the respondent appears to argue that his obligation to comply with the Lozada factors is excused because he has complied with them in the context of a criminal trial in a United States District Court in California. We disagree. Obviously, in order for this Board to assess the merits of the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim and to determine whether a plenary rehearing is necessary, the evidence supporting that claim must be submitted to the Board, not to a United States District Court. Furthermore, we see no indication of compliance with Lozada, even at the District Court level, in connection with the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance against the attorney who filed his 2003 motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. An alien’s failure to comply with the Lozada requirements, where it would have been reasonable to expect such compliance, constitutes a failure of proof, since such an omission effectively prevents the Board from assessing the substantive merits of the claim. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, — F.3d —, 2003 WL 22660175 (9th Cir. Nov. 12, 2003).
 
Because the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is defective on its face and because the respondent has identified no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s decision, will affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen and dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ilona Stanley, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: See. 241(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(D)(i)º - Conditional resident status terminated
 
Lodged: See. 241(a)(1)(G)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(G)(i)º - Marriage fraud
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This matter was last before the Board on July 22, 2003, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen these deportation proceedings, and his motion to reconsider our March 28, 2003, dismissal of the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his waiver application under section 216(c)(4)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1186(c)(4)(B). The respondent thereafter filed a timely motion to reconsider our July 22, 2003, denial of his motion to reopen. This Board has jurisdiction over the respondent’s current motion to reconsider pursuant to federal regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
We find that we did not err in requiring a showing of “misfeasance” for the respondent to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel through his prior motion to reopen. See Decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals, dated July 22, 2003, at 2; Respondent’s Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Reconsider, dated August 20, 2003, at 5-7. Even the respondent has conceded that the standard for determining ineffective assistance of counsel “can be satisfied by nonfeasance as well as misfeasance. See Strickland v ¿º. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984) (noting that claim for ineffective assistance of counsel must specify acts or omissions which were not the result of reasonable professional judgment)…” See Respondent’s Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Reconsider, dated August 20, 2003, at 6. Moreover, our use of the term “misfeasance” (the improper performance of some act which a person may lawfully do) in our prior denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen implicitly included both “nonfeasance” (the omission of an act which a person ought to do) and “malfeasance” (the doing of an act which a person ought not to do at all). See Black’s Law Dictionary, 6th Edition, at 1000; Respondent’s Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Reconsider, dated August 20, 2003, at 5-7. We further find that our requirement of “misfeasance” for ineffective assistance of counsel is in compliance with precedential case law. See Strickland v. Washington, supra; Zhao v. United States Department of Justice, 265 F.3d 83 (2nd Cir. 2001); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
*2 In addition, we find that we did not mischaracterize the respondent’s former counsel’s actions when we concluded, in our denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen, that they were “reasonable tactical decisions.” It is not for this Board to speculate concerning former counsel’s motivation for not submitting the evidence which the respondent sought to submit subsequent to his hearing. Rather, it is clear that the respondent’s former counsel was aware of the evidence and made a strategic choice not to submit it to the court. See Respondent’s Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Reconsider, dated August 20, 2003, at 7-9. We note that the letters from the respondent’s friends and family members, which were submitted with his motion to reopen, could have previously been obtained and submitted at his former hearing, and the letters from his former wife do not persuade us that “the qualifying marriage was entered into in good faith by the alien spouse …” See section 216(c)(4)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider and Reopen, dated April 26, 2003, and attachments.
 
Therefore, we find that none of the respondent’s contentions in his motion to reconsider reveals a factual or legal aspect of his case that was improperly overlooked, or presents a new argument which persuades us to alter our prior decision. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1).
 
Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

APPLICATION: Waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c)
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on January 18, 2001, when we remanded to provide the respondent an opportunity to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C, § 1182(c), pursuant to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit’s decision in St. Cyr v. INS, 229 F.3d 406 (2d Cir. 2000), aff’d, INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). On October 17, 2001, an Immigration Judge administratively closed the case and allowed the respondent’s former attorney, Leon Quintero, Esquire to withdraw as counsel of record. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) filed a motion to recalendar proceedings on June 17, 2001, and the case was reopened. The respondent now appeals the Immigration Judge’s August 28, 2003, decision denying his application for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Act. The appeal is dismissed.
 
The record shows that the respondent plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine, and was convicted on October 13, 1995. See Exh. 4 (conviction records). In her decision, the Immigration Judge found the respondent to be statutorily ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act because he had served over 5 years of imprisonment as a result of his conviction. The respondent contends on appeal that he was eligible for the waiver in December of 1997 when his case was first before an Immigration Judge and he was found ineligible pursuant to Matter of Soriano, 21 I&N Dec. 516 (BIA 1996; A.G., Feb. 21, 1997), and again in October of 2001 when the second Immigration Judge administratively closed the case. He argues that the first immigration Judge’s decision in 1997 violated his due process rights under the Constitution. He further argues that in 2001, he received ineffective assistance of counsel from his former attorney and the DHS engaged in affirmative misconduct. See Resp. Appeal Br. at 14.
 
We find that the Immigration Judge did not err in finding the respondent statutorily ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act because he had served over 5 years of imprisonment as a result of his conviction. See Matter of Davis, 22 I&N Dec. 1411 (BIA 2000) (reaffirming the existence of the 5-year bar for aliens whose section 212(c) applications are considered under the pre-1996 law). Although the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from Mr. Quintero and he has submitted a letter from his wife in support of that claim, he has failed to comply with the requirements as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In addition, the Board does not have the authority to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel against the DHS so as to preclude it from undertaking a lawful course of action that it is empowered to pursue by statute and regulation, and the respondent has not proven that the DHS engaged in the type of “affirmative misconduct” necessary for equitable estoppel to apply. See Matter of Hernandez-Puente, 20 I&N Dec. 335 (BIA 1991). Finally, we find that the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge’s denial of his application for a 212(c) waiver in 1997 violated his constitutional due process rights is without merit, as the Immigration Judge was properly applying the law as it stood at the time.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Akhtar Hussain, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on September 24, 2003, when we dismissed the respondent’s untimely appeal for lack of jurisdiction and found that the respondent had failed to establish ineffective assistance of his prior counsel as the reason for his failure to file a timely appeal. In our decision, the Board determined that the respondent had failed to fully comply with the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec, 637 (BIA 1988). On October 15, 2003, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider in which he submits additional evidence in support of his argument that the reason for his failure to file a timely appeal was due to his prior attorney’s ineffective assistance. The respondent’s motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in the Board’s decision in Matter of Lozada, supra, aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Matter of Lozada, supra, we held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must (1) be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) provide evidence that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) indicate whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. In addition to these requirements, an alien alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must also show that he or she was prejudiced by the actions or inactions of counsel. See Matter of Aassad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
In the present appeal, the respondent has complied with the three-step procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent has provided the required affidavit, informed former counsel of the allegations against her, and notified the appropriate disciplinary authorities in the State of Florida. However, we must deny the respondent’s motion to reconsider because he has not shown the required prejudice stemming from his prior counsel’s inaction. See Matter of Aassad, supra, at 561.
 
*2 In this matter, the respondent asserts that prior counsel’s failure to file a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen removal proceedings is prejudicial. We disagree. We find that the respondent has not reasonably shown any prospect for establishing that heavy traffic constitutes an exceptional circumstance, which would have warranted rescinding the Immigration Judge’s in absentia removal order and reopening the respondent’s removal proceedings. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1) (“The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances”). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Daniel M. Griebel
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent received proper notice of his hearing scheduled for August 24, 1993, and he failed to establish exceptional circumstances based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988),
 
On appeal the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge improperly denied his motion to reopen filed on August 4, 2003, as he now seeks reopening for consideration of his eligibility for adjustment of status based on his marriage to a United States citizen. The respondent states that he is now eligible to pursue adjustment of status since his visa petition has been approved. An alien is not required to rescind his or her deportation order under section 242B of the Act if he or she is pursuing an application for new relief, and provided there is no evidence that the respondent received the required warnings under section 242B(e) of the Act. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). Rather, the motion to reopen is only subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3).1 Under these standards, the respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s decision of August 24, 1993, and after September 30, 1996. He is accordingly precluded from having his motion considered under the general time limitations for a motion to reopen.2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

Pursuant to 8 C.F.R.§§ 3.2(c) and 3.23(b)(3), a motion to reopen for the purpose of acting on an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.

We therefore decline to address the issue of prima facie eligibility for relief from deportation, or whether the respondent would deserve a favorable exercise of discretion.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Oscar L. Amarow, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Nelson A. Vargas-Padilla
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
Sec. 212(a)(2)(C), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C)º - Controlled substance trafficker
 
Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
 
Lodged: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) º - Controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Waiver of inadmissibility
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s May 6, 2002, decision sustaining the charges of removability and pretermitting her application for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). The appeal will be dismissed in part and sustained in part, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
In her May 6, 2002, decision, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent failed to meet her burden of proving that she is entitled to be admitted to the United States and sustained the charges of removability against her. In addition, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent’s failure to timely submit an application for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act (Form I-191) constituted an abandonment of any such application. On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erroneously placed upon her the burden of proving admissibility. Further, the respondent requests an opportunity to apply for section 212(c) relief and asserts that her failure to file such an application before the Immigration Judge was due to the ineffective assistance of her former counsel.
 
The respondent concedes that she is inadmissible and removable under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), for her violation of a state law relating to a controlled substance (Tr. at 24). As a returning lawful permanent resident who has “committed an offense identified in section 212(a)(2),” the respondent is properly classified as an applicant for admission. See section 101(a)(13)(C)(v) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(v). Accordingly, the Immigration Judge correctly concluded that she bears the burden of proving that she is “clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible….” See section 240(c)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(c)(2); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(b). The respondent’s appellate argument challenging the Immigration Judge’s allocation of the burden of proof is therefore without merit.
 
*2 Upon consideration of the Immigration Judge’s decision and the record as a whole, we are persuaded that the failure of the respondent’s former counsel to file a Form I-191 by the court imposed deadline constituted ineffective assistance of counsel on its face. It is apparent that the respondent had provided former counsel with all necessary documentation in support of the Form I-191 prior to the deadline and that former counsel’s failure to file by the deadline was the result of a mistaken assumption on her part that another attorney in the same law firm had already done so (Tr. at 31-33). In our view, an exercise of reasonable diligence would have revealed to former counsel the necessity of either filing the Form I-191 by the deadline or, at a minimum, timely requesting leave of court for an extension of the deadline. The Immigration Judge acknowledged that the respondent is prima facie eligible for a section 212(c) waiver pursuant to the Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001), and therefore the failure of her former counsel to submit an application for such relief was highly prejudicial to the respondent’s interests. It appears that the respondent, though new counsel, is actively seeking to comply in good faith with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Therefore, we conclude that the preservation of the respondent’s due process right to a fair immigration hearing necessitates that the record be remanded to the Immigration Judge so that the respondent’s application for section 212(c) relief may be considered on the merits. We express no opinion at this time as to whether the respondent merits such relief in the exercise of discretion.
 
The following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed in part and sustained in part.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge so that the respondent’s request for a section 212(c) waiver may be considered on the merits.

IN RE: GUANGQUAN CHEN
File: AXX XX9 784 - Los Angeles
November 19, 2003
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patricia Vargas, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal is untimely. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was rendered orally on November 19, 2002. The appeal was accordingly due on or before December 19, 2002. The record reflects, however, that the Notice of Appeal was filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on October 28, 2003. We accordingly find that the appeal is untimely. In conjunction with the appeal, the respondent filed a Motion for Leave of Court to File Untimely Notice of Appeal as a Result of Ineffective Assistance of Counsel, and Request for Certification in which the respondent is raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as the reason for the untimeliness of his appeal. We note that the respondent contends that a complaint was filed with the State Bar of California and that he forwarded a copy of his Motion for Leave of Court to File Untimely Notice of Appeal as a Result of Ineffective Assistance of Counsel, and Request for Certification to his prior counsel. However, the respondent did not provide any evidence to support this claim; and, therefore, he has failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief from removal. We recognize that in the Ninth Circuit a respondent need not strictly comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); but, at a minimum, the respondent must demonstrate that the alleged ineffective assistance had prejudiced him. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002). In this case, the respondent has failed to do so. Therefore, upon review of the record, we find we do not have a sufficient basis to consider this appeal by certification. The Immigration Judge’s decision is therefore now final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.
 
We note that because we have dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J- J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael Johnson-Ortiz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Eric Bakken
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(G)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(G)(ii)º - Marriage fraud - failed or refused to fulfill marital agreement
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)º - Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Remand.
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. He appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 25, 2002, order graining voluntary departure upon his waiver of an appeal. He additionally requests that his case be remanded to the Immigration Judge so that he may pursue a self-petition under section 204(a)(1)(iii) of the Immigration ans Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(iii). We note that the record clearly indicates that the respondent affirmatively waived his right to appeal. See Tr. at 70. Thus, the appeal is generally barred, unless the respondent challenges the validity of the waiver. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(F); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39; Matter of L-V-K-, 22 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1999); Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001). We do possess jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s challenge to the validity of his appeal waiver. Id. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent avers, in his brief, that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to appeal, but that he was coerced into waiving such right by the Immigration Judge. He avers that the Immigration Judge threatened him and committed multiple procedural errors. He further claims that the waiver of his right to appeal was not voluntary because he received ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must generally comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 900 (9th Cir. 2003). Here the respondent failed to submit an affidavit explaining his agreement with former counsel, failed to give his former counsel an opportunity to respond, and failed to submit proof, beyond the current attorney’s unsworn declaration, that he filed an attorney grievance. Id. Thus, we find that he failed to adequately comply with Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 Furthermore, we do not find that the respondent’s claims, regarding his former counsel’s behavior, establish that his former counsel’s assistance was ineffective, nor that such assistance resulted in prejudice to the respondent. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra. The respondent avers that his former attorney failed to timely file Form-I-751, a Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence. The respondent claims that his attorney made a representation that such petition was filed on August 9, 2000, when it was not actually filed on such date. However, the record reveals that the respondent’s former counsel merely indicated, on August 9, 2000, that the petition was completed, but was not yet ready to be filed because she did not have enough copies of certain documents. See Tr. at 15-16. The attorney later indicated that the I-751 had been filed in September of 2000. See Tr. at 19. Even if the attorney did not promptly file the respondent’s I-751, we do not find that a misrepresentation was made regarding filing, nor that any delay prejudiced the respondent’s case. The Immigration Judge did allow the respondent to file the I-751. See Tr. at 15-19.
 
The respondent further claims that his counsel was ineffective because she filed for a waiver of the requirement to file a joint petition after the commencement of removal proceedings, which the respondent avers is forbidden by the regulations. In contrast, we note that the regulations provide that a conditional resident who is in removal proceedings may apply for such waiver until such time as there is a final order of removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1216.5(a)(2). Thus, this does not constitute ineffective assistance.
 
The respondent’s current counsel also avers that the respondent’s former counsel failed to communicate the evidentiary requirements for a waiver under 8 C.F.R. § 1216.5. However, the respondent failed to present an affidavit concerning the agreement that he had with his former counsel, or explaining what was or was not said to him by his former counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra (discussing the Lozada requirements). Furthermore, the respondent did bring a file with documentation to support his request for a waiver, which was prepared by his former counsel. See Tr. at 43, 52-54. In fact, the respondent specifically testified that his former counsel had discussed the proof needed to support such a waiver. See Tr. at 54.
 
The respondent also claims that his former counsel failed to object, based on hearsay, to the admission of the form I-213. However, we note that this is typically an invalid objection. See Espinoza v. INS, 45 F.3d 308 (9th Cir. 1995) (finding that admission of a properly certified form I-213 is fair, despite the inability to cross-examine the preparer).
 
*3 The respondent additionally avers that his former counsel wrongfully withdrew from representing him in his proceedings. However, we note that the respondent’s former counsel had indicated that she was working on the case pro bono, she was having trouble communicating with the respondent as she did not speak Spanish, and the respondent had sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) indicating that she was not adequately representing him. See Tr. at 37-40, 42. Thus, we find that neither the respondent’s former counsel’s withdrawal, nor the Immigration Judge’s approval of such withdrawal, was inappropriate. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.17(b). In addition, the Immigration Judge did offer to allow the respondent a 2 week continuance to find a new attorney, but the respondent elected to proceed without an attorney. See Tr. at 41. In sum, we find that the respondent failed to establish that he received ineffective assistance of counsel or that this affected the voluntariness of his waiver of appeal.
 
The respondent additionally avers that the Immigration Judge’s conduct prevented him from knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to appeal. The respondent claims that the Immigration Judge inappropriately encouraged him to accept voluntary departure, prior to the conclusion of proceedings, rather than pursuing an appeal. Regarding the Immigration Judge’s conduct, we note that the respondent failed to establish, and does not aver, that he was eligible for voluntary departure, pursuant to section 240B(b) of the Act. Therefore, the respondent can not establish that the Immigration Judge’s representations, concerning the respondent’s option to appeal an oral decision or accept voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Act, were not accurate. Thus, the fact that the Immigration Judge explained to the respondent why he may prefer to elect voluntary departure does not establish that the Immigration Judge acted inappropriately, nor that the respondent was coerced in any way.
 
The Immigration Judge’s warning that the respondent’s current girlfriend, whom the respondent had testified was here illegally, could be discovered by the DHS was not incorrect. See Tr. at 70-71. Although the Immigration Judge may have mis spoke, when she indicated that the respondent could return illegally, we do not find that this error was prejudicial or merits a finding that the respondent’s waiver of an appeal was involuntary. See Tr. at 71.
 
Concerning additional actions of the Immigration Judge, the respondent avers that she inappropriately questioned him during his hearings. However, we note that the Immigration Judge has a duty to “interrogate, examine, and cross-examine” a respondent. See section 240(b)(1) of the Act. Furthermore, the respondent fails to specify any particular question that was inappropriate.
 
*4 The respondent further avers that the Immigration Judge inappropriately turned off the tape recorder, during the hearing, in order to coerce the respondent to accept voluntary departure. However, the respondent fails to reveal anything that was said by the Immigration Judge, while off the record, that was inappropriate. The respondent has not submitted an affidavit alleging what occurred off the record or why it was not appropriate. Thus, there is no basis for such a finding.
 
The respondent also avers that the Immigration Judge improperly permitted the DHS to amend the charge of removability, and that she failed to follow the requirements of 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(e). However, we note that the DHS is permitted to file additional charges, and the new charge was read to the respondent and he was served with a copy of the additional charge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(e); see also Tr. at 74. The respondent was also told that he could have a 2 week continuance to address the new charge, but he elected not to accept such a continuance. See Tr. at 74. In sum, we can not find that the Immigration Judge’s conduct resulted in an unfair hearing or that she inappropriately coerced the respondent’s waiver of appeal.
 
In addition, we can not find that the described actions, of the respondent’s former counsel or the Immigration Judge, have prejudiced the respondent’s case. The respondent seeks a remand to pursue relief pursuant to section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act. The respondent avers that his former spouse physically and emotionally abused him. However, we note that the respondent previously testified that his wife did not hurt him, hit him, or beat him. See Tr. at 60-61. He also testified that she pushed him, but that he did not let her hit him. Id. He specifically stated “I never let her hit me.” Id. at 61. The respondent also testified that, although his former wife threatened to contact DHS, he did not consider that a threat because he was not afraid to return to his country. See Tr. at 62. When asked what hardship he would face if returned to Mexico, he said “there is no hardship.” See Tr. at 64. Thus, we can not find that the respondent’s case would have turned out differently if he had not waived appeal. Hence, even if the respondent had established ineffective assistance of counsel or that any of the Immigration Judge’s actions were inappropriate, we do not find that he has established prejudice to his case. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra, at 901.
 
Accordingly, we find that the respondent validly, knowingly, and intelligently waived his right to an appeal. In the alternative, we find that the respondent failed to establish that his case was prejudiced in any way. Thus, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: SHAHANA AKHTER
File: AXX XX2 504 - New York
November 18, 2003
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Freddy Jacobs, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely appeal from an Immigration Judge’s March 10, 2003, decision denying her motion to reopen following a hearing held on October 4, 1995, in which she was ordered deported in absentia. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the respondent was personally served with an Order to Show Cause (OSC, Form 1-221) on July 6; 1995 (Exh. 5), and the OSC notified her to appear for a hearing on August 2, 1995. The respondent appeared pro se on August 2, 1995, and was given written notice to appear at a hearing on October 4, 1995. The respondent did not appear on that date and was ordered deported in absentia.
 
The respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on February 27, 2003, alleging that she did not receive the OSC, notice of her hearing, or the in absentia order, and alleging that her prior attorney had advised her that her case had been closed. In her motion, she also stated that she is now eligible for adjustment of status based on both an approved I-130 and an approved I-140. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, noting that the motion did not accurately recount what had happened, that the respondent had been personally served with notice of her October 4, 1995, hearing, and that the respondent therefore failed to establish lack of notice. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
On appeal, the respondent, through counsel, acknowledges that the facts as presented in her motion before the Immigration Judge were incorrect. In addition, she contends that her prior attorney advised her not to attend her October 4, 1995, hearing, and therefore she received ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the respondent has not attempted to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), nor has she offered a reasonable explanation for her failure to do so at this time. Accordingly, on this record, the respondent has not established that her failure to appear at her hearing was due to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent on appeal also contends that she may not have received oral warnings of the consequences of failing to appear at her deportation hearing, and that there may not have been an interpreter present at her August 2, 1995, hearing when she received written notice. She therefore requests reopening to apply for adjustment of status, relief which was unavailable at the time of her hearing, pursuant to Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). However, the respondent’s motion to reopen for newly-acquired relief is untimely, as it was not filed within 90 days of the date of entry of her final administrative order, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. See Matter of M-S-, supra at 357 (finding that such motions are subject to the regulatory requirements of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)).
 
*2 Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey Okun, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa M. Golub
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
Sec. 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on September 9, 2003, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reconsider. The respondent had sought reconsideration of the Immigration Judge’s March 14, 2003, denial of a motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered deported in absentia. Now, the respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider dated October 2, 2003, in which he contends that the Board erred in dismissing his appeal. The motion is denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reconsider must be denied because it fails to specify any errors of fact or law in the Board’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1) (as renumbered by 68 Fed. Reg. 9824, 9830 (Feb. 28, 2003) (effective Feb. 28, 2003)). In the motion, the respondent contends that his appeal should have been considered by a panel of three Board Members. He argues that his original motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge should have been considered timely because his authorized representative paid for a timely motion to reopen; in the alternative, he argues that the filing deadline should have been equitably tolled due to the ineffective assistance of his counsel. The respondent also asserts that the Board should revisit its holding in Matter of Hernandez-Puente, 20 I&N Dec. 335 (BIA 1991), which states that the Board and the Immigration Judges do not have the authority to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel against the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) so as to preclude it from undertaking a lawful course of action that it is empowered to pursue by statute and regulation. Finally, the respondent asserts that he did have an attorney-client relationship with Michael Diraimondo, Esquire, and that he complied with the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
As we pointed out in our prior decision, even if the respondent could successfully make an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, he failed to demonstrate the due diligence required to equitably toll the filing deadline for the motion to reopen. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000) (finding that an alien who waited 2 years after the filing deadline failed to exercise due diligence for equitable tolling purposes). We also note that the fact that the respondent believes the appeal to have merit does not compel the Board to issue a decision by more than one Board Member. In general, the respondent’s arguments were either already addressed in the Board’s prior decision, or do not specify how the Board erred in making its determination. Therefore, the motion to reconsider must be denied.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Liam Ge, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Linda A. Dominguez
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(c)(i)º - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
In a decision dated December 18, 2002, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen in order to apply for cancellation of removal. The respondent has appealed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
First, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen because, inter alia, the respondent failed to establish that the respondent’s wife would experience exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if he was removed from the United States. See Matter of Monreal, 23 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2001)(qualifying relative must experience hardship that is “‘substantially’ beyond the ordinary hardship that would be expected when a close family member leaves this country” in order to meet the “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” standard). A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the applicant establishes a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The Immigration Judge properly found that the respondent failed to comply with reopening standards.
 
Second, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) points out that the Immigration Judge granted the respondent the privilege of voluntary departure on October 28, 2002, but he failed to depart as required. The DHS contends that the respondent is thus not eligible for cancellation of removal. Pursuant to section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), an alien who fails to depart following a grant of voluntary departure, and who has been provided written notice of the consequences of remaining in the United States, is statutorily barred from applying for certain forms of discretionary relief. We find that the respondent is barred from applying for cancellation of removal by section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d) because the he has remained in the United States after the scheduled date of departure.
 
The respondent also alleges that his prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has failed to comply with any of these requirements. See Stewart v. INS, 181 F.3d 587, 596 n. 9 (4th Cir. 1999). In the respondent’s affidavit, the respondent asserts that his former counsel is “bedridden and incommunicado,” and he thus could not notify him of his complaint. The respondent has submitted no evidence to substantiate these assertions. The respondent has also provided no reason why he could not have sent a letter outlining his complaint to his former counsel’s law office. Moreover, the respondent has not shown that he filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.

IN RE: SANG IL LEE
File: AXX XX5 642 - Seattle
November 12, 2003
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frederick P.S. Whang, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dana C. Laverty
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Remand; termination
 
In a decision dated May 10, 2000, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to suppress evidence and terminate proceedings, found him removable as charged, and granted him voluntary departure. The respondent has filed this appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (“the DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent was served with a Notice to Appear on February 11, 2000. It was alleged that he was a native and citizen of Korea who entered the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor on or about August 17, 1992, and was authorized to remain until September 16, 1992. He was charged with removability for remaining longer than permitted.
 
The respondent contested removability, and made a motion to suppress the evidence submitted by the DHS, and terminate proceedings. See generally Gonzalez-Rivera v. INS, 22 F.3d 1441 (9th Cir. 1994). The Immigration Judge’s decision sets out the respondent’s claim, and the evidence submitted by the respondent and the DHS (I.J. Dec. at 2-5). We adopt these findings on appeal, and will only summarize the facts here. See generally Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872 (BIA 1994).
 
The respondent was represented by Grosvenor Anschell at his hearing. The respondent testified that he was living in an apartment, and on February 11, 2000, an immigration agent and police officer knocked on the door around 7:00 a.m. The respondent opened the door. The officers identified themselves, asked him about his mother, and then walked inside (see Tr. at 20- 22, 27). The respondent did not give them permission to enter, and explained that he felt intimidated. The agents eventually asked the respondent about his immigration status, and he revealed that he was not lawfully present (Tr. at 20). On cross-examination, the respondent stated that the officers did not threaten him when they were at the door, that he never asked them to leave, that they never touched him or showed weapons, and that they allowed him to move around the apartment and use the telephone (see Tr. at 27-34).
 
The DHS presented the testimony of the immigration agent and the police officer who went to the respondent’s apartment on the morning in question. The immigration officer testified that they went to look for the respondent’s mother, who was suspected of being involved in a smuggling scheme. An unknown female answered the door, and gave them permission to enter. They subsequently encountered the respondent, who admitted that he was illegally present in the United States.
 
*2 The police officer testified that they were allowed in the apartment by the female, and that the respondent was told that he was not under arrest, and he freely answered questions. Both officers stated that if they are not invited into a residence they would leave (Tr. at 54, 73-74).
 
The Immigration Judge found that the officers testified credibly about the events in question. He noted that their testimonies were consistent, and that they were acting in their capacity as law enforcement officers. He did not find that the respondent’s testimony successfully rebutted their version of events. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to suppress, found that the Record of Deportable Alien (Form I-213) (Exh. 2) established the respondent’s removability, and granted him voluntary departure.
 
On review of the record, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not establish a basis for suppressing the evidence in question, and was removable as charged. We therefore adopt and affirm this portion of his decision. See Matter of Burbano, supra. We now address the respondent’s arguments on appeal.
 
The respondent now has new counsel, and he asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his hearing. Specifically, his attorney was not prepared, did not produce a key witness, and conducted cursory and ineffective examinations of the respondent and the DHS’ witnesses. The respondent submitted supporting documentation in accordance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); but see Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934 (9th Cir. 2003) (ineffective assistance of counsel may be established regardless of compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra). He also provided proof that Mr. Anschell was suspended for 2 years by the Washington state Bar Association on October 30, 2000, due in part to faulty representation of his clients.1
 
Even assuming that the respondent has established that his prior counsel was ineffective, we conclude that he has not established that he was prejudiced by this conduct. See Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (BIA 1999) (internal cites omitted). Specifically, we have no firm indication of what other evidence the respondent would have provided, and how it would have changed the outcome of his case. Rather, the respondent only makes general assertions that his case could have been better prepared and presented, and he speculates as to alternative outcomes.
 
For example, the respondent claims that a parent-child privilege may have been asserted which would have precluded some of his testimony at the hearing. However, he does not explain the origin of this “privilege” or how he was prejudiced by any admissions related to his parents. Similarly, the respondent asserts that a better attorney would have called the female who answered the door to testify, as this might have impeached the officer’s testimony. However, we have no statement from the female, or even the respondent, indicating that this witness would have been available for testimony, or would halve provided beneficial information. The respondent also states that a more effective cross-examination might have helped his case. However, his claim in this area is speculative, and is not supported by specific examples of why further cross-examination would have changed the result in this case. In this regard, we point out that the officers’ did present comprehensive testimony about the events in question, although most was revealed in the course of direct examination rather than cross-examination.2
 
*3 Any potential claim of prejudice is also undermined by the fact that even if the motion to suppress was granted, there would still be an alternative basis for removability. We refer to the case law establishing that even where an illegal arrest or search has occurred, the gathering of independent evidence based on the discovery of a person’s identity need not be excluded, and this includes information in DHS files and admissions made at a hearing. See Matter of Cervantes-Torres, 21 I&N Dec. 351, 353 (BIA 1996) (citing United States v. Guzman-Bruno, 27 F.3d 420 (9th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 796 (1984); Rodriguez-Gonzalez v. INS, 640 F.2d 1139 (9th Cir. 1981), cert denied, 513 U.S. 975 (1994) (and other cases)). In this case, the DHS obtained independent records establishing that the respondent has overstayed his permitted time in this country (see Exh. 2, Form I-213 and DHS printouts). The respondent’s removability therefore could have been established even assuming that the motion to suppress should have been granted.3
 
On appeal, the respondent also alleges that the DHS precluded him from presenting evidence on his behalf because they did not arrest the woman who answered the apartment door on the day in question. The respondent’s reasoning is that if the woman had been investigated, she would have been more likely to testify on the respondent’s behalf. This argument fails for several reasons. First, a decision by the DHS to institute removal proceedings involves the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and is not a decision that the Immigration Judge or this Board may review. See Matter of G-N-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 281 (BIA 1998). Second, it is the respondent’s responsibility to produce evidence to support his case, and if he wanted this witness to testify, the burden was on him to have made appropriate efforts. We see no reason to address the issue further.
 
We therefore find no basis to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision based on the arguments made on appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to so depart, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
*4 NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

On appeal, the DHS challenges the respondent’s portrayal of events at the hearing. We agree that there is some inaccuracy. For example, the appeal states that the DHS attorney told the respondent he could not consult with his counsel (see Appeal Brief at 6). However, the statements in question involve the Immigration Judge instructing the respondent that he should not confer with counsel before answering questions on cross-examination unless there was a legal concern (see Tr. at 23).

We are therefore not persuaded by the respondent’s attempts on appeal to distinguish his case from Rodriguez-Gonzalez v. INS, supra (see Appeal Brief at 9).

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James A. Lazarus

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)º - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on July 31, 2002, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The Immigration Judge pretermitted the respondent’s application for adjustment of status because it was incomplete and lacked an immediately available visa. The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s application for withholding of removal based on his failure to make a claim. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen proceedings based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the respondent’s motion on the basis that the respondent failed to provide a legally persuasive justification for tolling the 90-day statute of limitations. The respondent’s motion will be granted.
 
In his motion, the respondent alleges that he suffered a due process violation as a result of his prior counsel’s ineffective assistance. In particular, the respondent contends that his prior counsel should have pursued his claim for asylum and withholding of removal.
 
We find that the respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).1 Therefore, we turn to the issue of whether the respondent has shown that he suffered prejudice as a result of his counsel’s ineffective assistance. Prejudice results when “the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” See Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999).
 
The respondent contends that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s failure to pursue his claim for asylum. The respondent’s prior counsel, contends that he did not do so because the respondent was statutorily barred as a result of the 1-year filing deadline. The respondent entered in June 1995, and was served with the Notice to Appear on March 4, 1999. Therefore, the respondent would have had to file for asylum by April 1, 1998. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(2)(ii) (providing that the 1-year filing deadline shall be calculated from the date of the alien’s last arrival in the United States or April 1, 1997, whichever is later). The respondent contends that his reliance on his pending application for adjustment of status qualifies as an extraordinary circumstance permitting a late-filed application for asylum. The respondent claims that his wife filed a visa petition on his behalf in March 1997 (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 8). We do not find that filing of a visa petition constitutes an extraordinary circumstance because such a filing does not guarantee approval and adjustment of status. Therefore, inasmuch as the respondent was statutorily ineligible for asylum due to the 1-year filing deadline, we find that the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by his prior attorney’s conduct. See section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B).
 
*2 The respondent’s prior counsel contends that he did not pursue his claim for withholding of removal because the respondent was ineligible for relief based on the DHS’s finding that the respondent engaged in marriage fraud. Initially, we note that the Immigration Judge did not make a finding on the issue of marriage fraud. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status because it was incomplete and lacked an immediately available visa. Furthermore, marriage fraud does not render the respondent ineligible for withholding of removal. See section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3). We are also troubled by the prior counsel’s submission of a Form I-589 which does not answer the questions related to persecution (Exh. 2). Moreover, the respondent appears to be prima facie eligible for such relief based on his newly filed Form I-589 and supporting documentation, which were submitted with his motion to reopen. Based on the foregoing, we find that the respondent has established that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s ineffective assistance. See Ortiz v. INS, supra.
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the circuit in which this case arises, has held that the statute of limitations for filing a motion to reopen is tolled from the time that an alien has been victimized by a negligent attorney until he learns of the negligence. See Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000). The respondent contends that he discovered his prior counsel’s ineffectiveness in a meeting with his current counsel’s on June 16, 2003. The respondent filed his motion to reopen on July 25, 2003. Therefore, based on binding circuit law, we will equitably toll the 90-day deadline for filing motions to reopen. Id. Accordingly, we find that the respondent’s motion was timely filed.
 
Based on the foregoing, we will grant the motion to reopen and remand proceedings to the Immigration Judge for a hearing on the respondent’s application for withholding of removal.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for entry of a new decision.

File: AXX-XX3-574 - Miami

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hector M. Diaz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF SERVICE:
 
Georgina M. Picos
Assistant District Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. By order dated July 7, 2003, the Immigration Judge sustained the charge of removability against the respondent, denied his request for relief from removal, and ordered him removed. The Immigration Judge’s order reflects that the respondent, who was represented by counsel, waived his right to appeal. On July 10, 2003, however, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider in which he requested that the Immigration Judge vacate that portion of his July 7, 2003, decision finding that the respondent had waived his appeal rights. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on the grounds that his prior decision was legally and factually correct and that the respondent’s appeal waiver appeared to have been knowingly and intelligently made.
 
Whenever the right to appeal is waived, the decision of the Immigration Judge becomes final and may be implemented immediately. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39. Moreover, by waiving appeal, an alien relinquishes the opportunity to obtain review of the Immigration Judge’s ruling. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(a)(1). Thus, it is important that any appeal waiver be knowingly and intelligently made. See United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. 828, 840 (1987); see also Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320 (BIA 2000). In fact, immigration judges are obliged by statute to notify aliens subject to removal of their appeal rights. See section 240(c)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4). A party wishing to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or a direct appeal with this Board. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001). In this instance, the respondent chose the former route. To be valid, a motion to reconsider before the Immigration Judge must specify the legal or factual errors in the Immigration Judge’s prior decision and must be supported by pertinent authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2). In this instance, however, the respondent’s motion to reconsider did not allege that the Immigration Judge committed any legal or factual error, such as failing to comply with the notification requirements of section 240(c)(4) of the Act. Rather, the respondent alleges that he did not understand the consequences of his failure to seek an appeal. In as much as the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, he has failed to satisfy any of the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
*2 While the respondent may in retrospect regret his decision to waive appeal, we see no basis for disturbing the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the decision dated August 28, 2002, in which an Immigration Judge denied, the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings. On July 9, 1998, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure. On August 2, 2002, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that the failure of her former attorney to file a timely motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent also argues that equitable tolling should be applied. However, we need not reach this issue since the respondent has failed to comply with any of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).1 See Stojkovic v. INS, 54 Fed.Appx. 728, 2002 WL 31546506 (3rd Cir. 2002) (claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was not exempt from the Lozada procedure); Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127 (3rd Cir. 2001) (alien did not satisfy the procedural requirements of Lozada).
 
Furthermore, the record indicates that at the conclusion of immigration proceedings on July 9, 1998, the respondent was granted voluntary departure until November 16, 1998. The respondent was provided oral and written warnings of the consequences of remaining in the United States after the termination of the period of voluntary departure. The record further indicates that the respondent waived appeal of that decision. Pursuant to section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), an alien who fails to depart following a grant of voluntary departure, and who has been provided written notice of the consequences of remaining in the United States, is statutorily barred from applying for certain forms of discretionary relief. We find that the respondent is barred from applying for adjustment of status by section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d). An alien who remains in the United States after the scheduled date of departure is statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief. Therefore, because the respondent has remained in the United States after the scheduled date of departure, the respondent is statutorily ineligible for the relief sought. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

File: AXX XX2 977 - Honolulu
November 5, 2003
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dennis W. Jung, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This is the third time that the respondent’s case has been before the Board. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on October 31, 2002. We denied a motion to reopen on April 24, 2003, and denied another motion to reopen on July 23, 2003. The respondent filed yet another motion to reopen on September 8, 2003. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent brings a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent claims that counsel representing her on January 24, 2003, filed a “frivolous motion to reopen”, seeking adjustment of status based on marriage to a United States citizen (Respondent’s Mot., at 8). The respondent argues that, since the I-130 visa petition had not been approved at that time, that former counsel erred in filing the motion to reopen.
 
Even were the motion deadline and numerical limitations for motions excused, the respondent fails to show prejudice resulting from her attorney’s actions. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226 (9th Cir. 2002); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000). The respondent’s January 24, 2003, motion was not “frivolous”. Rather, in Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002), the Board held that a properly filed motion to reopen for adjustment of status based on a marriage entered into after the commencement of proceedings may be granted in the exercise of discretion, notwithstanding the pendency of a visa petition filed on the alien’s behalf, under certain circumstances.
 
In our April 24, 2003, decision denying reopening, we mistakenly stated that the motion could not be granted because the respondent failed to submit proof of an approved visa petition. However, we went on to say that a favorable exercise of discretion was not warranted. As noted, the decision to reopen proceedings involves the exercise of discretion. Matter of Velarde, supra. The record includes the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent “is engaged in prostitution”, which she based on testimony of a Honolulu police officer concerning “various sexual acts” which the respondent had offered to perform for payment (I.J. at 4-8). The respondent fails to show how former counsel caused us to exercise discretion unfavorably. Instead, the respondent’s own behavior caused that result.
 
*2 The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Earle A. Sylva, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jayme Salinardi
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on July 29, 2002. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before October 28, 2002. The record reflects, however, that the respondent first submitted the motion on August 18, 2003, but it was rejected and not actually filed until September 2, 2003. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time. The respondent has requested sua sponte acceptance of the motion. The Board retains limited discretionary powers under the regulations to reopen or reconsider cases on our own motion. 8 C.F.R § 1003.2(a). That power, however, allows the Board to reopen proceedings sua sponte in exceptional situations which we find are not present here. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
In his motion, the respondent has raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. In addition, the motion must establish prejudice arising from the alleged failings of prior counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent here has met these requirements, with the exception of the third. However, his attorney has responded to the allegations against him and established that he attempted to notify the respondent of the Board’s prior decision.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied. As we have denied the motion to reopen, the motion for a stay of deportation is also denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On January 24, 2000 the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, because it was untimely filed We accordingly returned the record to the Immigration Court without further action. On February 15, 2001, the respondent has submitted a Form EOIR-26, Notice of Appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals from a Decision of an INS Officer. Due to its content, it will be construed as a motion to reopen. On May 3, 2002, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider. These motions will be denied.
 
With respect to respondent’s motion to reopen, filed on February 15, 2001, the Board does not normally have jurisdiction over motions filed in cases where the Board never assumed initial jurisdiction, such as when an alien waives his appeal rights. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974). We retain jurisdiction over the instant motion to the extent that it challenges the finding of untimeliness or requests consideration of the reasons for untimeliness. See Matter of Lopez, Interim Decision 3343 (BIA 1998).
 
With respect to the motion to reconsider, a motion to reconsider in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 30 days after the date of that decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). In the instant case, a motion to reconsider would have been due on or before February 23, 2000. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive respondent’s motion to reconsider until May 3, 2002. The motion to reconsider was therefore filed out of time.
 
In his motion, the respondent has raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. In addition, the motion must establish prejudice arising from the alleged failings of prior counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent here has failed to meet these requirements.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael A. O. Brown, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent seeks reopening and rescission of his in absentia order based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), “not sacrosanct,” and substantial compliance may be sufficient). However, the ineffective assistance that has been alleged by the respondent relates to former counsels’ failure to prevail on a motion to change venue in time for him to make travel arrangements. He has not alleged that ineffective assistance of counsel precluded him from filing the motion to reopen within the statutorily required period.
 
There is no dispute that the respondent received proper notice of the hearing. In fact, according to the respondent, he was personally aware of the hearing date and that his counsel had not been successful in securing a grant of a change of venue. Unless lack of notice has been demonstrated, a motion to rescind an in absentia order must be filed within 180 days of the in absentia order. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The in absentia order was entered on February 22, 2001. His motion was not filed until July 9, 2002. The respondent’s motion is untimely, and there is no equitable tolling issue on these facts. We therefore need not reach the question whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel relating to the motion to change venue that would constitute an exceptional circumstance for his failure to appear.1

We point out, however, that the submission of a motion to change venue does not generally relieve an alien of his obligation to attend the scheduled hearing absent notification that the motion had been granted. See Hernandez-Vivas v. INS, 23 F.3d 1557 (9th Cir. 1994).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Claudia Valenzuela, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Karen E. Lundgren,
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 On May 6, 2003, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged, he deemed her application for adjustment of status to be abandoned, and he ordered her removal to Mexico. The respondent appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be sustained.
 
We note that, at the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent stood convicted of a felony in the State of Illinois. On June 16, 2003, however, that conviction was vacated, and the respondent was convicted of misdemeanor theft.
 
The Immigration Judge considered the respondent’s application abandoned because of her failure to file proper documentation in a timely manner, and his decision appears to have been well within his authority and discretion. However, certain facts have been presented subsequent to the Immigration Judge’s decision, after jurisdiction had passed from the Immigration Judge to the Board, that persuade us that the respondent likely was prejudiced by her former counsel’s conduct of her case.
 
Litigants are generally bound by the conduct of their attorneys, absent egregious circumstances. LeBlanc v. INS, 715 F.2d 685 (1st Cir. 1983): Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In statements by the respondent and her aunt, statements which were signed but not notarized as affidavits, it is reported that she had significant difficulty both communicating with her former counsel and understanding what he was doing in regard to her case. The respondent stated that she has been detained throughout these proceedings and, while the attorney who was involved in her criminal proceedings had been cooperative, former counsel in her removal proceedings had not been. It is alleged that the respondent was “confused” on the day of the hearing and could not understand why she was ordered removed, rather than allowed to pursue her adjustment application. After it became apparent that former counsel was not being “straightforward” with her, after filing an appeal form, the respondent reportedly discharged him.
 
The respondent’s current counsel reports that former counsel has been uncooperative in providing access to her file, further complicating her appeal, and a complaint has been filed with his state bar disciplinary board. According to current counsel, former counsel has been advised of the action taken but has not responded.
 
It appears to us that the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, in demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel, to include providing former counsel the opportunity to respond to her allegations. We note that former counsel was reprimanded on May 20, 2003, by the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois. While that reprimand clearly was not related to the matter at hand, it does serve to demonstrate that former counsel does have a history of engaging in misconduct. Of particular concern to us is former counsel’s apparent refusal to allow the respondent access to her file, which, according to current counsel, constitutes a violation of Rule 1.15 of the Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct.
 
*2 While we certainly support the Immigration Judge’s requirement that applications for relief from removal be timely filed, and we find no error on his part, considering the facts available to him at the time of his decision, we are of the opinion that, in this case, the respondent’s opportunity to apply for a relief for which she has at least a colorable claim was denied due to an egregious inaction on the part of her former counsel. We will consequently sustain her appeal and remand this case to afford her the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status and a corresponding waiver of inadmissibility.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and the Immigration Judge’s decision is vacated insofar as it relates to the finding that the respondent abandoned her application for adjustment and a waiver of inadmissibility.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and a new decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Day, Charles, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). We will generally defer to an Immigration Judge’s adverse credibility finding that is based on inconsistencies and omissions that are central to the claim where (1) the discrepancies and omissions are actually present in the record; (2) the discrepancies and omissions provide specific and cogent reasons for the adverse credibility finding; and (3) the alien has not provided a convincing explanation for the discrepancies and omissions. Matter of S-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 1328 (BIA 2000); Matter of A-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 1106 (BIA 1998); see also Secaida-Rosales v. INS, 331 F.3d 297 (2d Cir. 2003) (holding that an Immigration Judge must provide specific, cogent reasons for rejecting an alien’s testimony; those reasons must bear a legitimate nexus to the finding, and must be valid grounds for disregarding the testimony). In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held that the presence or absence of corroborating evidence may properly be considered in assessing an asylum applicant’s credibility where it could reasonably be expected. See Diallo v. INS, 232 F.3d 279 (2d Cir. 2000). In addition to the discrepancies and omission noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent failed to provide any corroborating information from her father, mother, or other students with which she allegedly practiced Falun Gong. Despite the generous amount of time that the respondent had to prepare her claim, she failed to acquire any of these easily obtainable and verifiable documents. Matter of S-M-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 722, 725 (BIA 1997). With respect to the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, she has not complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carlos Cruz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lee P. Crystal
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)] - Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on January 7, 2003, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s denial of suspension of deportation. The respondent, who is a native and citizen of Mexico, now alleges that she was ineffectively represented by her former counsel, Peter DeBruyn.1 She requests that we reopen proceedings and remand to the Immigration Court so that she may submit additional information. The motion is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2.
 
Our previous decision upheld the Immigration Judge because the respondent failed to demonstrate good moral character as required for suspension of deportation under former section 244(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1254(a)(1). In particular, the respondent had failed to submit a required police “clearance,” even though she had admittedly been jailed in the past (Tr. at 26-27). The respondent now alleges, however, that it was Mr. DeBruyn who should have made her aware of the requirement. She essentially argues that this attorney’s alleged failure to advise her of this excused her from providing the information. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).2
 
As an initial matter, we observe that the respondent could have made her Lozada-related claim prior to our last decision since she was already represented at that time by a new attorney. Her original appellate brief is bereft of any such arguments; she has offered no reason why she failed to raise such contentions sooner or why she should be permitted a second chance to do so now.
 
In any event, the respondent has still failed to submit any type of police clearance; she now merely alleges in her motion that she would do so if the case were remanded. This is noteworthy since the respondent has now had nearly 5 years to provide such evidence, but has not done so even though she has retained at least two additional attorneys since she was before the Immigration Court. We are not inclined to find that the attorney who represented her previously provided her with ineffective representation since it appears that the respondent herself has refused to submit such evidence. A motion to reopen will not be granted if an alien fails to establish prima facie eligibility for the underlying relief sought. See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, 320 F.3d 1061, 1072 (9th Cir. 2003)(ineffective assistance of counsel context); see also INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). We find that the respondent has still failed to provide prima facie evidence of good moral character. We also observe that the respondent testified that her suspension application was true (Tr. at 18-19) yet therein she apparently falsely denied ever having been incarcerated. Compare Tr. at 26-27 with Exh. 2 (Form EOIR-40), Item 55. Thus, we would deny the motion to reopen for that reason as well. Cf. INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 105-106 (1988) (in cases involving discretionary relief, the Board may deny a motion to reopen solely in the exercise of discretion, even where prima facie eligibility for such relief has been shown). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
*2 The respondent contends that the former attorney in question did not properly assist her with respect to establishing the 7 years continuous physical presence required for suspension eligibility. See generally, Matter of Nolasco, 22 I&N Dec. 632 (BIA 1999). A review of the record, however, reveals that the respondent did attempt to establish physical presence, but that her own evidence fell short. Why she blames her prior attorney for this deficiency is not clear, nor does she offer an explanation as to why she failed to make this Lozada argument during her original appeal Again, even with her motion to reopen, she has still not submitted any additional evidence that would properly establish the required physical presence. See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, supra. Accordingly, we do not find that her former counsel provided ineffective assistance to her in this regard. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F. 3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (stating that Matter of Lozada, supra, “is intended to ensure both that an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one”).
 
Similarly, the respondent now avers that her former attorney prejudiced her claim by failing to appear at her final merits hearing before the Immigration Judge. However, she was represented by another attorney at that time, and she has not submitted persuasive evidence to show that the result would have differed. Moreover, she did not raise this issue either when her case was on direct appeal to this Board. She has offered no reason why she should now have a second chance to raise new objections to the proceedings below.
 
In light of the foregoing, we find that the respondent has failed to identify any shortcoming in her prior representation which would lead us to reopen proceedings pursuant to Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
Finally, we note that in an attempt to show that she would experience extreme hardship upon deportation, another requirement for suspension relief, the respondent has now submitted several recent medical records with her motion detailing various disabilities—most notably regarding a knee problem.3 According to the records, the respondent underwent a total left knee replacement. She subsequently had soft tissue swelling and a 10- to 15-percent diminished range of motion with occasional to intermittent moderate pain. We observe that while these records were created after the Immigration Judge’s decision, essentially all of them, except for one physician’s letter which simply lists her various diagnoses, predate the Board’s decision. Thus these records could have previously been submitted, and we would have had to consider such evidence prior to our decision. See Ramirez-Alejandre v. Ashcroft, 319 F.3d 365 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Kazemi, 19 I&N Dec. 49 (BIA 1984). The respondent has offered no persuasive reason why proceedings should be reopened to permit her another opportunity to submit such evidence that she should have already had in her possession before the Board’s decision. Further, none of this information amounts to prima facie evidence that the respondent would experience extreme hardship upon return to her country.4 In her motion, the respondent’s current attorney concedes that, “arguably…[the respondent] could seek medical attention in Mexico to treat this array of problems ….” Respondent’s Motion at 6. But, it is contended, she would likely be unable to meet the financial cost of such treatment. This argument is insufficient because it is no more than unsupported speculation. The respondent has submitted no evidence concerning the cost of relevant medical treatment in Mexico. She doubts her ability to obtain “semi-sedentary” work, a limitation imposed by her medical condition, but has offered no evidence that such work is unavailable to her in Mexico. Thus, her belated attempts to establish extreme hardship do not persuade us to reopen proceedings.
 
*3 The respondent has thus failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for suspension of deportation and thus offers us no persuasive reason why proceedings should be reopened. See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, supra. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

The respondent was apparently represented by this attorney prior to her final hearing before the Immigration Judge, at which time another attorney took her case.

The respondent has attempted to comply with the technical requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. As discussed in this decision, the outcome here turns upon the respondent’s having failed to set forth a prima facie case for suspension relief. We find that it is thus unnecessary to further address the Lozada requirements. See e.g., Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237, 1240, n.6 (9th Cir. 2000) (failure to comply with Lozada requirements is not necessarily fatal to a motion to reopen).

The respondent has no qualifying relatives whose hardship can be considered for suspension purposes. See section 244(a)(1) of the Act, supra.

While a June 2002 medical entry indicated that the respondent should return to her surgeon for further treatment of her knee condition, a subsequent evaluation from October 2002 states that she had “achieved a maximum medical benefit from the therapeutic regimen employed and has now reached, a clinical plateau.”

IN RE: HARRIS KRISTANTO SARENGAT NG
File: AXX XX1 715 - Memphis
October 20, 2003
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Camille O. Bowman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Harris Lee Leatherwood
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on August 28, 2002. The motion was filed late, on June 10, 2003. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion.
 
Underlying the motion is a claim of ineffective assistance of the respondent’s former attorney. There is, however, no excuse provided for the lateness of the motion. The respondent was unrepresented by counsel on appeal, and our decision was promptly received by him (Respondent’s Affidavit).
 
In any event, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 191 & N Dec. 637 (BIA1988). These cases require that the alien file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority, or adequately explain why no filing was made. The motion states that the respondent “intends” to file a complaint against counsel, but does not say when the respondent might do so (Respondent’s Mot., at 6). This does not evidence compliance with the requirements of our case law. See Hamid v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 465, 469 (6th Cir. 2003) (“The fact that a grievance will be filed, without more, does not satisfy Lozada’s requirement that a complaint be filed before the affidavit is submitted to the BIA, nor does it furnish an explanation of why it was not so filed.”) (emphasis in original).
 
The Board in Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 603-605 (BIA 1996), gave several reasons for the “bar complaint” requirement. We noted that the requirement protects against collusion between aliens and counsel in which “ineffective assistance” is used to achieve delay. Id. We found that the bar complaint, like the other filings required by Matter of Lozada, supra, greatly aids us in adjudicating the claim. Id. We also stated that the filing of such a complaint is a “relatively small inconvenience” for an alien seeking a new hearing after proceedings have been concluded at great government expense. Id. The disciplinary process could consider, and evaluate, the actions taken by former counsel. Matter of Rivera-Claros, supra. The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

IN RE: RABAH A. ABUSABE
File: A35 934 280 - Miami
October 17, 2003
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
George J. DeFabio, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF SERVICE:
 
Frieda M. Goldstein
Assistant District Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred by denying his motion to reopen, and asserts that he established ineffective assistance of counsel and complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, l9 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (lst Cir. 1988).
 
In his decision dated September 9, 2002, the Immigration Judge noted that during the proceedings on June 13, 2002, the respondent was instructed to file all applications for relief by August 12, 2002. The record reflects that on August 12, 2002, the respondent’s former attorney filed a motion to withdraw as the respondent’s attorney of record, indicating that the respondent had ignored her repeated requests to set up an appointment at her office to complete the applications due by August 12, 2002. With her motion to withdraw, the respondent’s former attorney submitted copies of letters that she sent to the respondent dated June 17, 2002, July 18, 2002, and August 7, 2002. In the first two letters the respondent’s former attorney advised the respondent that he must communicate with her office and make an appointment to prepare the applications. In the letter dated August 7, 2002, she informed the respondent that due to his lack of cooperation, she would be withdrawing as his attorney of record. However, the respondent failed to submit any applications for relief by the deadline of August 12, 2002, as required. Consequently, the Immigration Judge deemed the respondent’s applications abandoned for failure to file.
 
A failure to request relief in accordance with a schedule set by the Immigration Judge constitutes a waiver of the opportunity to file for such relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (2003) (stating that if an application is not filed within the time limit set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application shall be deemed abandoned). The Board has long held that applications for benefits under the Act are properly denied as abandoned when the alien fails to timely file them. See Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992); Matter of Jean, 17 I&N Dec. 100, 102 (BIA 1979). The respondent was given two months to submit any applications for relief, which he failed to do. We find that the Immigration Judge provided the respondent with sufficient time to complete any applications applications for relief. Thus the respondent’s failure to file the applications for relief resulted in a waiver of his opportunity to file for such relief. Furthermore, the respondent failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. He has not complied with all of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, and the letters submitted by his former attorney of record clearly conflict with the respondent’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.1 Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We note that the respondent submitted affidavits from his brother, Ribhi Hasan Ahmad, and his brother-in-law, Majed Farraj, in which it is claimed that they attempted to call the respondent’s former attorney of record on numerous occasions on the respondent’s behalf, but their telephone calls were never returned. However, the respondent has not submitted any telephone records verifying that such telephone calls were made by his brother and brother-in-law to his former attorney of record between June 13, 2002, and August 12, 2002.

IN RE: REYES MARIN-MONTOYA
File: A42 325 982 - Dallas
October 17, 2003
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio A. Lopez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Saundra Haynes Arrington
Assistant District Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On December 18, 2001, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, because it was untimely filed. We accordingly returned the record to the Immigration Court without further action. Now the respondent has filed a motion with the Board requesting that we reconsider our dismissal of the untimely appeal. However, the motion to reconsider has been filed out of time and will be denied.
 
The Board does not normally have jurisdiction over motions filed in cases where the Board never assumed initial jurisdiction, such as an untimely appeal. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974). We retain jurisdiction over the instant motion to the extent that it challenges the finding of untimeliness or requests consideration of the reasons for untimeliness. See Matter of Lopez, Interim Decision 3343 (BIA 1998).
 
A motion to reconsider in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 30 days after the date of that decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). In the instant case, a motion to reconsider would have been due on or before January 17, 2002. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until May 22, 2003. The motion to reconsider was therefore filed out of time.
 
In his motion, the respondent has raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. In addition, the motion must establish prejudice arising from the alleged failings of prior counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent here has failed to meet these requirements. While a copy of the complaint filed against his former attorney with the Texas Bar Association has been included with the motion,1 the respondent has not included a copy of an affidavit setting forth the agreement entered into with former counsel; nor is there anything in the record to indicate that the respondent has informed his former attorney of the allegations lodged against him.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

IN RE: HARVINDER SINGH
File: A73 050 208 - San Francisco
October 7, 2003
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Martin Resendez Guajardo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa M. Koven
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of India, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered deported in absentia on June 14, 2001, under section 240(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b). The appeal is dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent, through counsel, argues that although notice of the hearing was purportedly sent to his former attorney, he never received the notice or knew of the hearing date. The respondent has attached, to his brief on appeal, records from his file that he obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. These include transcripts from the master calendar hearing on May 21, 1999, and the hearing from which he was absent, and a letter to his former attorney requesting written proof that she had attempted to contact him regarding his hearing date.
 
We find that proper notice of the June 14, 2001, hearing, was provided to the respondent.1 The record shows that his former attorney, Ms. Alison Dixon, Esquire, was acting as his representative because she entered a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative (Form EOIR-28) in the record of proceeding. The record also shows that Ms. Dixon was provided with a copy of the hearing notice by regular mail and she appeared on the appointed time for the hearing. See Exh. 4; Resp. Appeal Br. at B (transcript). Notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2) (as renumbered by 68 Fed. Reg. 9824, 9830 (Feb. 28, 2003) (effective Feb. 28, 2003)); see also Garcia v. INS, 222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir. 2000); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (as renumbered by 68 Fed. Reg. 9824, 9845 (Feb. 28, 2003) (effective Feb. 28, 2003)). If proper notice was provided to the respondent’s counsel of record, the in absentia order may not be rescinded unless the respondent prevails on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in accordance with the requirements as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

The record reflects that the hearing took place on June 14, 2001. See Exh. 4 (notice of rescheduled hearing). Therefore, the fact that the transcript lists June 13, 2001, as the date was most likely due to the fact that the Immigration Judge misspoke at the start of the hearing.

IN RE: MOHAMED TAMER H ELSHEHABI
File: A75 985 441 - Newark
October 7, 2003
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William F. Henning, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on December 2, 2002. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not here), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before March 3, 2003. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until April 17, 2003, but it was rejected for filing defects. Subsequently, the respondent’s motion to reopen was not filed with the Board until May 12, 2003.
 
On June 27, 2003, the respondent’s former attorney of record, Petro Morgos, Esquire, submitted a letter indicating that he never received the Board’s decision in this matter.1 On July 28, 2003, the respondent filed a certification in support of his motion to reopen through his new attorney of record, William F. Henning, Esquire. In his certification, the respondent states that neither he nor his former attorney received the Board’s decision, that he was unaware his appeal had been dismissed when he applied for work authorization. Furthermore, he indicates that he is currently married to a United States citizen and a visa petition has been filed on his behalf. He seeks reopening to apply for adjustment of status.
 
The record reflects that the Board’s decision dated December 2, 2002, was mailed to the respondent’s former attorney at the address provided to the Board on a Form EOIR-27 filed on June 30, 1999: 800 N. Kings Highway, Suite 307, Cherry Hill, New Jersey 08034. The United States Post Office returned the decision to the Board, and the envelope indicates “not deliverable as addressed-unable to forward.” An EOIR-27 subsequently filed with the Board on May 12, 2003, reflected a new address for the respondent’s former attorney: 800 N. Kings Highway, Suite 505, Cherry Hill, New Jerseys, 08034. On June 26, 2003, the respondent’s former attorney filed another Form EOIR-27 reflecting a new address of 6 West Kings Highway, Haddonfield, New Jersey, 08033.
 
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(e), attorneys who enter an appearance before the Board have an affirmative duty to keep the Board apprised of their current address and contact information. Changes of address should be made through a Form EOIR-27 (Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Board of Immigration Appeals Executive Office for Immigration Review) within five (5) business days. Thus it appears that on December 21, 2002, the Board’s decision was correctly mailed to the former attorney’s last known address of 800 N. Kings Highway, Suite 307, Cherry Hill, New Jersey 08034, but apparently his former attorney had moved to Suite 505 without notifying the Board. The respondent’s motion to reopen was not filed with the Board until May 12, 2003, and was therefore filed out of time. We cannot make a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel in this instance because the respondent failed to meet the requirements under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

File: AXX XX1 817 - Los Angeles
October 6, 2003
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Oma Nkele, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Charles (Chuck) Redman
Assistant District Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On March 10, 2003, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision. As part of this decision, we considered the respondent’s apparent argument that his counsel’s non-appearance at the removal hearing should be excused. We decided that the Immigration Judge did not err in holding the hearing without counsel, and that in any event the respondent failed to show how the presence of counsel would have affected the proceedings. The respondent filed a motion on April 10, 2003, which is timely if considered a motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899-900, 901-03 (9th Cir. 2003). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent’s attorney, who is the same attorney who failed to appear at the removal hearing, argues that she provided ineffective assistance of counsel by not appearing at the removal hearing, and that the respondent was not able to pursue adjustment of status based on marriage to a United States citizen. The respondent has completely failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Most critically, the respondent must show prejudice resulting from his attorney’s actions. Matter of Assaad, supra, at 556, 561-62; Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638; Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226 (9th Cir. 2002); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000). As we noted in our earlier decision, the respondent has not submitted an application for adjustment of status or otherwise shown that he is eligible for such relief. The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated March 4, 2003. In support of the motion to reopen, the respondent states that he received ineffective assistance of counsel as evidenced by the fact that he did not sign an EOIR Form 28, authorizing the law firm of Bretz and Coven to represent him before the Immigration Court. The respondent states that he was unaware that a form had been sent to him for his signature until August 11, 2003. In addition, the respondent argues that the Board improperly dismissed his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to terminate. We will construe this part of the motion as a motion to reconsider. In support of this part of the motion, the respondent essentially repeats arguments made on his behalf in the appeal.
 
To the extent that the instant motion (received on August 27, 2003) requests reconsideration of our prior order in this case, we note that it is untimely. A motion to reconsider must be filed with the Board within 30 days after the mailing of our last decision, or in this case, by April 3, 2003. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). To the extent the instant motion seeks reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel, we note that this application is untimely as well. A motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceedings, or in this case, by June 2, 2003. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Although the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, under whose jurisdiction this case arises, recognizes equitable tolling of such deadlines in ineffective assistance of counsel cases, the court held that an alien must demonstrate not only that his constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000). Here, the respondent gives no explanation for why he let almost 3 months go by before raising the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. It is clear from the record that although the respondent may not have signed an EOIR Form 28, he was well aware that Bretz and Coven was representing him, since he appeared at two hearings while being represented by them. Even if, as the respondent appears to suggest, he was at some disadvantage because his counsel appeared telephonically, it was clear based on comments from the Immigration Judge that attorneys from the Bretz and Coven law firm were representing the respondent’s interests. There is no support for the respondent’s suggestion that he was somehow unaware that these attorneys were acting on his behalf. Finally, we note that the respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), which requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. The respondent also has not established that he was prejudiced by any ineffective assistance of counsel, particularly with regard to the telephonic appearance issue. As a matter of fact, in his motion, the respondent repeats key arguments made by his counsel on appeal, thereby contradicting the notion that prior counsel’s representation was ineffective or that it prejudiced his case. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lisa S. Brodyaga, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cheri L. Jones
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(A), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(A)] - Excludable at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(7)(B)(i)(II), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(B)(i)(II)] - No valid nonimmigrant visa or border crossing card
  
APPLICATION: Terminate deportation proceedings; remand
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 27, 1998, finding her deportable as charged and denying her application for suspension of deportation. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand. The motion will be denied and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, last entered the United States on January 2, 1997. The respondent does not contest that, pursuant to section 241 (a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1251 (a)(1)(A), she was excludable at the time of that entry. Rather, both on appeal and in her motion to remand, the respondent argues that, because she is an immigrant rather than a nonimmigrant, the specific charge of deportability contained in the Order to Show Cause cannot be sustained and, therefore, the deportation proceedings should be terminated. The respondent further argues that her lack of nonimmigrant status is evidence that her former counsel acted improperly in conceding to the charge of deportability. We disagree
 
The record supports, and the respondent does not contest, the finding that the respondent was excludable at the time of entry. Thus, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that, pursuant to section 241(a)(1)(A) of the Act, the respondent is deportable as charged (I.J. at 2).
 
Along with her motion, the respondent has submitted evidence indicating that she has complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent, however, has not demonstrated the required prejudice stemming from prior counsel’s actions. See Matter of Lozada, supra at 640. The respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim revolves around her former counsel’s concession to the charge of deportability. The respondent argues that, because of her former counsel’s actions, she was ordered deported on grounds for which she was not deportable. As explained above, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent is deportable pursuant to section 241 (a)(1)(A) of the Act. The respondent does not contest that finding nor has she provided evidence demonstrating that she is not otherwise deportable. Furthermore, the record reveals that the respondent received a full and fair hearing on the merits of her claim before the Immigration Judge. Consequently, the respondent has not shown that she was prejudiced from prior counsel’s conduct and, therefore, we decline to remand the case.
 
*2 In addition, we find that the record supports the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent failed to meet her burden of proving that she acquired the requisite 7-year period of continuous physical presence (I.J. at 8). See section 244(a)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254(a)(1). The respondent was served with the Order to Show Cause on February 17, 1997 (Exh. 1). The respondent failed to provide sufficient testimonial and documentary evidence to prove that she was present in the United States for 7 years prior to that date. As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent indicated that, in addition to her latest departure and reentry, she has departed and reentered the United States on other occasions since her alleged initial entry (I.J. at 5-8; Tr. at. 55, 81-88; Exh, 6). The respondent, however, was unable to recall and did not provide testimony describing the circumstances surrounding those additional departures and returns (Tr. at 55, 81-88). As a result, the respondent failed to meet her burden of proving the requisite presence.
 
Finally, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent failed to demonstrate the requisite good moral character (I.J. at 8-10). See sections 244(a)(1), (e)(1) of the Act. The DHS submitted both testimonial and documentary evidence refuting the respondent’s testimony denying both that she claimed to be a United States citizen upon her last entry and that she told the inspection agent that she frequently enters this country by claiming United States citizenship (Tr. at 56-57, 78, 166-67, 169-72, 175; Exh. 6). Under the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the Immigration Judge to conclude that the respondent provided false testimony for the purpose of obtaining immigration benefits and thus failed to demonstrate good moral character.
 
On whole, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s ultimate decision denying the respondent’s application for relief. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXX XX9 584 - New York
October 2, 2003
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frank R. Liu, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision dated August 11, 2003. He asserts that, contrary to our finding, his appeal was timely filed and therefore should have been considered. We have reviewed the record and agree with the respondent that his appeal was timely. The motion for reconsideration is granted but the appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent makes three conclusory arguments. He contends first that denial of his motion to reopen by the Immigration Judge was error since he wrote a detailed affidavit. Secondly, he argues that it would have been too “harsh” if he had sued or reported his former attorney to the state bar disciplinary authorities. He was also afraid of antagonizing his former attorney. Thirdly, the respondent asserts that following the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10(1st Cir. 1988), would be “mechanical” and would significantly harm his interests. These allegations form the sole basis for appealing the Immigration Judge’s decision. We affirm the result reached below. An essential element in the respondent’s motion, as the Immigration Judge found, alleged that his failure to show up at his hearing was due, at least in part, to an ineffective assistance of counsel. Nothing on appeal meaningfully addresses the Immigration Judge’s finding that, if so, the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, must be met. The respondent’s arguments on appeal are merely his reasons why he should be exempt from meeting the Lozada requirements. As the respondent has not met his burden in showing that denial of the motion to reopen was clearly erroneous, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nina J. Fantl, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Remand; cancellation of removal; voluntary departure
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM: The respondent is appealing the Immigration Judge’s February 12, 2002, decision finding that his application for cancellation of removal had been abandoned, and denying his request for voluntary departure. On appeal, the respondent argues that he did not file an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), before the Immigration Judge because of the ineffective assistance of his prior counsel and requests that this matter be remanded to the Immigration Judge. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not opposed the respondent’s motion to remand. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Court.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfY the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (lst Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he or she suffered prejudice as a result of the attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640.
 
The record reflects that the respondent has adequately complied with the requirements set forth above. Before proceedings will be reopened, however, it must also be determined that the counsel’s conduct was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA1998).
 
We note from the record that former counsel, Mr. Arnold Garcia, appeared before the immigration Judge on June 11, 2001, and requested an opportunity for the respondent to be considered for cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge set a deadline of November 1, 2001,for filing the application for relief, and also set a date for a hearing to consider the merits of the respondents application for relief. At this time, the Immigration Judge specifically instructed Mr. Garcia that it was necessary for him to file the application in a timely manner and also necessary that he appear to represent the respondent at the next scheduled hearing, on February 12, 2002, unless he was specifically allowed to withdraw from the case. The application was not completed or filed as required, and counsel did not appear at the continued hearing for which he had notice. On February 12, 2002, the Immigration Judge deemed the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal to be abandoned.
 
*2 In his motion to remand, the respondent avers that former counsel did not assist the respondent in submitting the application for cancellation of removal; failed to inform the respondent of the deadlines associated with the case,1 failed to provide the respondent with his file until all of the deadlines were missed; failed to file a motion to withdraw from his representation of the respondent; failed to inform the respondent concerning a motion to pretermit filed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (now the Department of Homeland Security,“DHS”); and failed to appear at the final hearing. As a result of this negligence, the respondent’s only opportunity to obtain cancellation of removal was lost.
 
We find that the respondent has established that his failure to file his completed cancellation of removal application by the date required was as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Lozada, supra; Matter of B-B, supra. Moreover, given the evidence before us, we find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge to provide the respondent a further opportunity to present his application for cancellation of removal and any other relief which for which he may be eligible. The record is remanded for further proceedings and the entry of a new decision.

The respondent explains that because he does not speak English, he did not understand what was said by the Immigration Judge at the hearing. According to the respondent, the Spanish interpreter did not translate any of the hearing into Spanish, except when the respondent was asked by the Immigration Judge to state his name and to indicate whether he wanted Mr. Garcia to be his attorney.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reconsider has been filed out of time and will be denied. The Board’s last order in these proceedings was entered on April 21, 2003. A motion to reconsider a decision of the Board must be filed within 30 days after the date of that decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). In the instant case, a motion to reconsider would have been due on or before May 21, 2003. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until May 27, 2003. The motion to reconsider was therefore filed out of time.
 
In his motion, the respondent has raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. In addition, the motion must establish prejudice arising from the alleged failings of prior counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent here has failed to meet these requirements.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A) (i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondents’ application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). We reject the respondent’s contention on appeal that all areas of relief were not explained to her and that her due process rights were therefore violated. The respondent in this case was represented by counsel at her last two hearings before the Immigration Judge. See Tr. 19, 26. In addition, a review of the record reflects that prior to the time that the respondent secured counsel, the Immigration Judge questioned the respondent at length in order to determine the forms of relief for which the respondent was eligible. See Tr. 3-8, 12-18. Indeed, we find insufficient evidence to establish that the respondent was provided anything other than a full and fair hearing. Although the respondent maintains that she was not adequately represented by counsel, we find no evidence that the respondent has attempted to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See generally Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir.2000). Moreover, we find no evidence that the respondent was actually prejudiced by the actions of counsel. Id. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to so depart, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
*2 NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN RE: GALINDO HERNANDEZ, FRANCISCO JULIAN (RD)
File: AXX-XX0-792 - LOS ANGELES
September 30, 2003
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal is untimely. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was mailed on August 26, 1999. The appeal was accordingly due on or before September 27, 1999. The record reflects, however, that the Notice of Appeal was filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on May 05, 2003. We find that the appeal is untimely. In conjunction with the appeal, the respondent claims that his prior counsel failed to inform him of the Immigration Judge’s decision in his case and failed to inform him of his appeal filing deadline. The respondent has not explained why he waited nearly 4 years after his May 10, 1999, hearing date to file the instant appeal. He has failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing his case. He has failed to meet the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), and failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. In fact, the only documentary evidence he has submitted is a nondetailed affidavit and a letter from the State Bar of California stating that his complaint against prior counsel was lacking in detail and could not be acted upon without further information. Furthermore, the respondent has not pointed to any error in fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s 19-page written decision, thus failing to meet the requirement that specific reasons be given for the filing of an appeal. 8 C.F.R. 3.3(b). We do not find this factor to be an adequate reason to accept this appeal by certification. The Immigration Judge’s decision is therefore now final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14, and 1240.15.
 
We note that because we have dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 BIA 1997).

Eric Bakken
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)] - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)] - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; termination
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on January 22, 2003, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings, alleging ineffective assistance by his former counsel. The motion will be granted and the record will be remanded.
 
The respondent has complied with the requirements enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, the respondent has submitted a letter from the Washington State Bar Association’s Office of Disciplinary Counsel, indicating that his former counsel has been suspended from the practice of law. Further, we note that the Immigration Judge indicated that the respondent’s former counsel had mishandled multiple immigration matters and that he was the subject of numerous complaints of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Tr. at 14-15. Both the Immigration Judge and the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) noted that the respondent would likely-have a valid claim, on appeal, with regard to ineffective assistance of counsel. Id. We agree.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent indicates that, although he elected to proceed without counsel at his January 4, 1999 hearing, after his counsel failed to appear, he did not realize, as he had not been properly instructed by his former counsel, that he needed to present witnesses and affidavits in order to support his claim. The respondent avers that he was, therefore, prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of his former counsel, in that he was inadequately prepared to state his case and he was unaware of the evidence that he needed to produce in order to establish that his marriage to Felicia was not fraudulent. We find that the record reflects that, indeed, the respondent was not prepared and did not seem to be aware, at his January 4, 1999, hearing, that he needed to provide proof of the legitimacy of his marriage, or what that proof would entail. See Tr. at 27. The respondent, in an affidavit asserts that his former counsel never discussed the need for evidence with him. Considering these assertions, and the respondent’s demonstrated confusion at his hearing, and his compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, we find that the respondent has established that his former counsel’s assistance was ineffective and that it did result in prejudice to him. See generally Agyeman v. INS, 296 F.3d 871, 877 (9th Cir. 2002) (noting that an alien who has not had an adequate opportunity to present evidence is prejudiced); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003)(discussing prejudice in the context of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
*2 We additionally note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in which jurisdiction the instant case arises, has held that an Immigration Judge must apprise a respondent, whose marriage is in question, of reasonable means of proving the bona fides of such marriage. See Agyeman v. INS, supra, at 882 (finding that a full and fair hearing can not take place unless a pro se alien is apprised of the evidence that he may present in support of the bona fides of his marriage). Evidence of the marriage’s bona fides may include:jointly-filed tax returns; shared bank accounts or credit cards; insurance policies covering both spouses; property leases or mortgages in both names; documents reflecting joint ownership of a car or other property; medical records showing the other spouse as the person to contact; telephone bills showing frequent communication between the spouses; and testimony or other evidence regarding the couple’s courtship, wedding ceremony, honeymoon, correspondences, and shared experiences. Id. Although it appears that such evidence may be scarce in this case, it is also evident from the record that the need for such evidence was not explained to the respondent, by the Immigration Judge, prior to the January 4, 1999, hearing. See Tr. at 12, 27 (although the Immigration Judge indicates that he previously told the respondent that Felicia’s testimony was needed, we note that the record merely indicates that the respondent’s former attorney was told that her testimony would be very helpful). Thus, the respondent was not given an adequate explanation regarding evidence that could be presented, nor an opportunity to present such evidence.
 
Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings, consistent with the foregoing opinion, and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; rescission
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on October 3, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind an order of removal entered in absentia on May 12, 2005. Also on October 3, 2008, the Board dismissed the respondent’s motion to reopen the proceedings for adjustment of status. On April 22, 2009, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen and rescind to enable him to apply for adjustment of status, The respondent claims that neither the Immigration Court nor his former attorney, Elihu S. Massel, Esquire, informed him of his duty to appear at the scheduled hearing, and he raises a deficient performance of counsel claim against Attorney Massel. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009) (hereinafter “Matter of Compean”). He further raises a deficient performance of counsel claim against his former attorney Joseph F. DeFelice, Esquire, who assisted him with the filing of his motion to reopen and rescind before the Immigration Judge and his appeal before the Board, because Attorney DeFelice did not raise a viable ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Attorney Massel in compliance with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Id. at 741-42. The motion will be denied.
 
The instant motion is subject to the time and number restrictions imposed on such motions to reopen under sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(iii). Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act, however, an order entered in absentia may be rescinded at any time upon a motion to reopen if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive proper notice of the hearing.¿FN1º
 
Initially, we find that the Notice of Hearing was properly mailed to the respondent at his address of record on September 29, 2004. See section 239(a)(2)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(2)(A). The fact that the respondent engaged the services of Attorney Massel to file a motion to change the venue of the May 12, 2005, hearing, and that the motion to change venue was filed on January 5, 2005, reveals that the respondent was aware of the scheduled hearing. We also find the respondent’s claim that the Immigration Court failed to notify him of his duty to appear to be completely without merit. The Notice to Appear, a copy of which is included in the record, informs the respondent of the time and place of the scheduled hearing, as well as the consequences of the failure to appear. Furthermore, we reject the respondent’s claim that his failure to appear should be excused because Attorney Massel did not inform him of his duty to appear before the Immigration Judge. We emphasize that upon receipt of the Notice of Hearing, the respondent was properly notified of the May 12, 2005, hearing, and of the consequences of the failure to appear. The respondent has not claimed, and there is no evidence to suggest, that Attorney Massel instructed the respondent not to attend the hearing. Finally, the fact that the respondent filed a motion to change venue did not excuse him from his duty to appear, even if Attorney Massel informed the respondent on the eve of the hearing that the motion had not been granted. It is well established that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the alien of his responsibility to appear, and unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. See Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 1985); see also Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988) (holding that the grant or denial of a change of venue motion is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge).
 
*2 In sum, we find that the respondent has failed to establish that Attorney Massel’s representation with regard to the motion to change venue caused the respondent’s failure to appear at the scheduled hearing, thus prejudicing the outcome of this case. As we find that no error on the part of Attorney Massel has been shown, we reject the respondent’s deficient performance of counsel claims against Attorney Massel and Attorney DeFelice. See Matter of Compean, supra, at 732 (an alien who seeks to reopen his removal proceedings based on deficient performance of counsel must, inter alia, establish that his lawyer’s failings were egregious and that he suffered prejudice from the lawyer’s errors). In conclusion, we find that the respondent received proper notice of the scheduled removal hearing, and that he failed to appear for the hearing at the appointed time and venue. Accordingly, the following order denying the respondent’s untimely, number-barred motion to reopen will be entered.¿FN2º
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Decided February 12, 2003
**1 *553 (1) Case law of the United States Supreme Court holding, in the context of criminal proceedings, that there can be no deprivation of effective assistance of counsel where there is no constitutional right to counsel does not require withdrawal from Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), finding a right to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in immigration proceedings, where the United States Courts of Appeals have recognized that a respondent has a Fifth Amendment due process right to a fair immigration hearing, which may be denied if counsel prevents the respondent from meaningfully presenting his or her case.
 
(2) The respondent did not establish that his former counsel’s failure to file a timely appeal constituted sufficient prejudice to warrant consideration of his late appeal on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.

George R. Martin,
Appellate Counsel
BEFORE: Board En Banc: SCHMIDT, HOLMES, HURWITZ, VILLAGELIU, COLE, GUENDELSBERGER, GRANT, MOSCATO, MILLER, BRENNAN, ESPENOZA, OSUNA, and HESS, Board Members. Concurring Opinions: FILPPU, Board Member, joined by SCIALABBA, Chairman; PAULEY, Board Member.
*554 OSUNA, Board Member:
In a decision dated February 22, 2001, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, in which he alleged ineffective assistance of prior counsel and sought to pursue an appeal of a previous denial of relief. The respondent has appealed from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
  
I. ISSUE
 
The issue before us is whether an exception to the 30-day time limit for filing an appeal from a decision of an Immigration Judge can ever be made based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In regard to this question, the Immigration and Naturalization Service seeks to have us reexamine and overturn our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The Service notes that the United States Supreme Court has held, in the context of criminal proceedings, that where there is no constitutional right to the appointment of counsel at government expense, there is no constitutional basis for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 752-54 (1991); Wainwright v. Torna, 455 U.S. 586, 587-88 (1982). According to the Service, we have not addressed this Supreme Court authority, with which Matter of Lozada and its progeny are in conflict. Thus, the Service contends that we should reconsider Lozada in light of Coleman and Wainwright.
 
**2 We acknowledge the arguments made by the Service but are not persuaded that we should withdraw from our decision in Matter of Lozada. Although the Supreme Court’s decision in Coleman was rendered more than 10 years ago, the Service has never raised it to challenge Lozada in subsequent cases before the Board. See, e.g., Matter of A-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998); Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997); Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996), aff’d, 122 F.3d 1062 (4th Cir. 1997) (unpublished table decision). Furthermore, for more than a decade the circuit courts have recognized Lozada as valid precedent setting forth procedures by which respondents may present claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.
  
II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Syria who entered the United States in 1993 as a nonimmigrant visitor. The record reflects that he was subsequently granted conditional permanent resident status on the basis of his marriage to a United States citizen. Removal proceedings were instituted in 1997 after the termination of his status.
 
*555 In proceedings before the Immigration Judge, the respondent sought a waiver under section 216(c)(4)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B) (1994 & Supp. IV 1998), to remove the conditional basis of his permanent resident status. The Immigration Judge denied the waiver, finding that limited evidence was submitted to assess the qualifying marriage and that the respondent knew little about his wife. The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States in a decision dated April 2, 1998. The respondent reserved appeal but his attorney submitted the appeal a week late.2 We dismissed the appeal as untimely on September 19, 2000.3
 
On February 12, 2001, nearly 3 years after the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent, represented by new counsel, sought reopening, presumably so the Immigration Judge would reissue his decision in order for a timely appeal to be filed.4 With his motion, the respondent submitted evidence in compliance with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, including a grievance filed with the State Bar of Texas. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on February 22, 2001, and the respondent has appealed from that decision.
 
On appeal, the respondent has admitted that the motion filed with the Immigration Judge was untimely, but he argues that former counsel did not inform him of our decision dismissing his original appeal as untimely. He asserts that he did not learn of our order until a Service officer sought to arrest him. The respondent therefore contends that his motion asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should have been considered. In *556 support of his appeal, he has submitted a letter from the State Bar of Texas to his current counsel, stating that the Investigatory Panel of the District Grievance Committee determined, based on the respondent’s complaint, that there was just cause to believe that former counsel committed professional misconduct.
  
III. ANALYSIS
  
A. Matter of Lozada
 
**3 In Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639-40, we set forth the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, noting that they were necessary to provide a basis for evaluating the many claims presented, to deter baseless allegations, and to notify attorneys of the standards for representing aliens in immigration proceedings. First, we held that the alien must submit an affidavit detailing the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and the representations counsel made or did not make in this regard. We also stated that the alien must inform counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance and give him or her the opportunity to respond. Finally, we concluded that the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, such as a state bar, with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, or adequately explain why no filing was made. In addition to these requirements, an alien alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must also show that he or she was prejudiced by the actions or inactions of counsel. Id. at 640.
 
We revisited these procedures in Matter of Rivera, supra, at 603-05, where we set forth further policy reasons for the “complaint” requirement of Matter of Lozada. We noted that such a filing increases our confidence in the validity of the particular claim, reduces the likelihood that an evidentiary hearing will be needed, and serves our long-term interests in monitoring the representation of aliens by the immigration bar. Matter of Rivera, supra, at 605. We further determined that the bar complaint requirement acts as a protection against collusion between counsel and client to achieve delay in proceedings.
 
It is clear that Matter of Lozada provides a measure of protection for aliens who are prejudiced by incompetent counsel. As a removal proceeding has the potential to deprive a respondent of the right to stay in the United States, which can include separation from family and return to possible persecution, the procedures in that proceeding must be fundamentally fair. Moreover, as discussed below, the courts have consistently recognized that ineffective counsel may deprive an alien of a fair hearing. See, e.g., Saakian v. INS, 252 F.3d 21, 24-25 (1st Cir. 2001). The Lozada approach has *557 provided an appropriate framework for analyzing ineffective assistance claims, balancing the need for finality in immigration proceedings with some protection for aliens prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel.
  
B. Supreme Court and Circuit Court Decisions
 
**4 The Service argues that Matter of Lozada conflicts with the Supreme Court decisions in Coleman v. Thompson, supra, and Wainwright v. Torna, supra. In Wainwright, the Supreme Court found that since a convicted felon had no constitutional right to counsel to pursue a discretionary state appeal, he could not be deprived of the effective assistance of counsel by his attorney’s failure to timely file the discretionary appeal. Wainwright v. Torna, supra, at 587-88.
 
Citing that decision, the Supreme Court reiterated in Coleman that where there is no constitutional right to counsel, there can be no deprivation of effective assistance of counsel. In that case, the prisoner’s attorney had sought state habeas review of various claims, but had filed his state appeal late, resulting in a procedural default. The prisoner claimed that his attorney’s error should excuse the procedural default and allow federal habeas review of the merits of his claim. The Court rejected this argument, holding that because there is no constitutional right to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings, a petitioner cannot claim constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such proceedings. Coleman v. Thompson, supra, at 752-53.
 
In light of Coleman and Wainwright, the Service argues that we should reconsider and overturn Matter of Lozada and hold that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot amount to a constitutional violation in immigration proceedings, where there is no constitutional right to appointed counsel. Amici disagree, arguing that respondents in immigration proceedings have both a constitutional and statutory right to competent counsel.5 According to amici, the Supreme Court’s decisions in Coleman and Wainwright are limited in their application to the specific criminal contexts in which they arose and are not relevant to whether respondents in immigration proceedings may assert a constitutional claim of ineffective assistance based on the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
 
*558 We are not persuaded by the arguments advanced by the Service and decline to overrule our decision in Matter of Lozada, supra. We first acknowledge some ambiguity in the basis set forth in that decision for respondents to assert ineffective assistance claims. Relying on governing circuit court law at the time, we stated that any right to counsel a respondent may have in immigration proceedings is grounded in the Fifth Amendment guarantee of due process, and that ineffective assistance of counsel is a denial of due process only if the proceedings were so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his or her case. Id. at 638 (citing Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931 (9th Cir. 1986); Paul v. United States INS, 521 F.2d 194 (5th Cir. 1975)). Our decision can also be seen as setting forth a “high standard” by which we will consider exercising our limited certification authority in a case where attorney malfeasance has occurred. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639; see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002) (noting that the Board’s authority to certify cases to itself in its discretion is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). The Service appears to acknowledge that we may consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under such authority.
 
**5 In any event, since Matter of Lozada was decided 15 years ago, the circuit courts have consistently continued to recognize that despite having no right to appointed counsel in an immigration hearing, a respondent has a Fifth Amendment due process right to a fair immigration hearing and may be denied that right if counsel prevents the respondent from meaningfully presenting his or her case. See, e.g., Osei v. INS, 305 F.3d 1205, 1208 (10th Cir. 2002); Xu Yong Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127 (3d Cir. 2001); Jobe v. INS, 238 F.3d 96 (1st Cir. 2001); Hernandez v. Reno, 238 F.3d 50 (1st Cir. 2001); Huicochea-Gomez v. INS, 237 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2001); Iavorski v. United States INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241 (9th Cir. 2000); Akinwunmi v. INS, 194 F.3d 1340 (10th Cir. 1999); Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, 178 F.3d 1139 (11th Cir. 1999); Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d 879 (2d Cir. 1994); Figeroa v. United States INS, 886 F.2d 76 (4th Cir. 1989).
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, has joined the other circuits that have found a basis in the Fifth Amendment for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. In Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001), the court noted that while there is no Sixth Amendment right to counsel in deportation proceedings, because such proceedings are civil in nature, aliens do have a constitutionally protected right to procedural due process in deportation proceedings. This due process right is violated when the representation afforded to an alien is so deficient as to impinge on the fundamental fairness *559 of the proceedings. Id.; see also Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000) (upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada); Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84 (5th Cir. 1994). We are required to follow this Fifth Circuit law in cases arising within that circuit. Matter of Yanez, 23 I&N Dec. 390 (BIA 2002); Matter of K-S-, 20 I&N Dec. 715 (BIA 1993).
 
Numerous circuit court decisions have also generally endorsed the procedural requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See, e.g., Xu Yong Lu v. Ashcroft, supra, at 132 (concluding that the three-prong Lozada test is a “reasonable exercise of the Board’s discretion”); Lara v. Trominski, supra, at 498 (finding that the general application of the Lozada rules is not an abuse of discretion); Lata v. INS, supra, at 1246 (noting that the Board has laid out a “comprehensive procedure” that petitioners should follow, and that this procedure has been adopted by other circuits). See generally Fajardo v. INS, 300 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2002).6
 
**6 Significantly, most of the decisions cited above were rendered in the decade after the Supreme Court decided Coleman v. Thompson, supra. This strongly suggests that the courts of appeals have not viewed the Supreme Court’s pronouncements in the criminal context as requiring a reexamination of the due process underpinnings of ineffective assistance of counsel claims in the immigration context. The sole circuit court decision that has questioned the basis for Matter of Lozada and that has suggested that aliens in immigration proceedings may not have a constitutional due process basis for raising ineffective assistance claims did so in dicta and in a divided opinion. Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498, 500 (7th Cir. 2001);7 see also Pop v. INS, 279 F.3d 457 (7th Cir. 2002). Moreover, the court in Stroe v. INS, supra, specifically stated that the Lozada requirements are within the Board’s discretionary authority. In any event, the Seventh Circuit had previously held that ineffective assistance of counsel in an immigration proceeding may result *560 in a denial of due process. Mojsilovic v. INS, 156 F.3d 743 (7th Cir. 1998); Henry v. INS, 8 F.3d 426 (7th Cir. 1993). The court in Stroe did not explicitly overrule this prior precedent.
 
As a result of this extensive body of law, the principle that aliens may have a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel if an attorney’s actions were so deficient as to foreclose the fundamental fairness of the proceedings is settled law in most circuits. We are therefore bound by this precedent. Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25, 31-32 (BIA 1989). These circuit court cases, including those in the Fifth Circuit, specifically considered the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in the immigration context and concluded that it may amount to a constitutional due process violation.
 
The Supreme Court cases cited as controlling by the Service were decided years ago and arose in the context of criminal, rather than immigration, proceedings. Coleman v. Thompson, supra, at 752-54; Wainwright v. Torna, supra, at 587-88. We acknowledge, of course, that Supreme Court law is paramount and must be respected. However, accepting the Service’s interpretation of Supreme Court law in this case would amount to a decree by the Board that the circuit courts that have analyzed the issue in the immigration context, and who are clearly able to consider the Supreme Court’s authority, have reached an incorrect result. We are unwilling to so hold, as it is beyond our limited authority as an administrative decision-making body. Matter of Martin, 23 I&N Dec. 491, 492 (BIA 2002) (deeming circuit court decisions to be “authoritative” precedent).8
 
**7 We therefore decline to accept the Service’s argument that Matter of Lozada should be overruled as a result of the Supreme Court’s decisions in Coleman v. Thompson and Wainwright v. Torna. We see no reason, based on Supreme Court law that has never been directly applied to immigration proceedings, to disavow a decision that has garnered general approval in the circuit courts for more than 15 years.9
  
*561 C. Application of Matter of Lozada
 
In the present appeal, the respondent has complied with the three-step procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada. He has provided the required affidavit, informed former counsel of the allegations against him, and notified the appropriate disciplinary authorities in the State of Texas. However, we must dismiss the respondent’s appeal because he has not shown the required prejudice stemming from prior counsel’s actions. The respondent asserts that former counsel’s failure to file the appeal in a timely manner is per se prejudicial. We disagree. Although, in some instances, counsel’s failure to file a timely appeal may constitute per se prejudice in removal proceedings, that is not the case here.
 
The exact parameters of due process protections in cases involving ineffective assistance of counsel are unclear. See Chowdhury v. Ashcroft, 241 F.3d 848, 854 (7th Cir. 2001) (holding that while there is case law providing that aliens have protection against ineffective counsel based on the Fifth Amendment, the extent of that protection is unclear, and probably fewer protections are guaranteed than if immigration proceedings were governed by the Sixth Amendment); Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, supra, at 1146 (holding that an alien asserting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must make a showing that he or she was eligible for the relief requested). The Fifth Circuit has held that an alien seeking to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must show not only that counsel was ineffective, but also that the alien suffered “substantial prejudice” as a result of counsel’s errors. Miranda-Lores v. INS, supra, at 85; Ogbemudia v. INS, 988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir. 1993); see also United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, 313 F.3d 225, 230 (5th Cir. 2002) (stating that procedural protections accorded an alien in a removal proceeding are less stringent than those available to a criminal *562 defendant because removal hearings are civil, rather than criminal, proceedings).
 
We note that in Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 484 (2000), the Supreme Court held that “counsel’s constitutionally deficient performance depriv[ing] a defendant of an appeal that he otherwise would have taken,” establishes a “successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim entitling him to an appeal” without any additional showing of prejudice. However, for the same reasons that we do not find the Supreme Court’s decisions in the criminal context in Coleman v. Thompson and Wainwright v. Torna controlling in the immigration context, we do not find that the Court’s pronouncement in Roe v. Flores-Ortega requires us to find per se prejudice from counsel’s failure to file an appeal in immigration proceedings. See Hernandez v. Reno, supra, at 55-57 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding that while, in the criminal context, counsel’s failure to comply with a defendant’s request to appeal is treated as prejudice per se, citing Roe v. Flores-Ortega, the court was unwilling to “incorporate into civil deportation proceedings the whole apparatus of Sixth Amendment precedent”). But see Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir. 2000) (adopting the reasoning of Roe v. Flores-Ortega where an appeal of a denial of asylum was filed late).
 
**8 Our review of the record indicates that the respondent received a fair and complete hearing before the Immigration Judge. He was well represented by counsel throughout the hearing before the Immigration Judge and was provided every opportunity to present his case for a waiver under section 216(c)(4)(B) of the Act.10 In a careful decision, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had failed to meet his burden of showing that he had contracted a valid marriage, which is necessary for a waiver under section 216(c)(4)(B). Matter of Stowers, 23 I&N Dec. 605 (BIA 1999); Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938 (BIA 1995). In addition, the respondent has made no showing in his motion alleging ineffective assistance of counsel that he is eligible for any relief from removal, or that there was error in the Immigration Judge’s decision. Accordingly, we find that the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced from prior counsel’s conduct, and we will dismiss the appeal.
  
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Matter of Lozada, supra, has given the Board a useful framework for evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and is in accord with controlling precedent in most circuits. We therefore decline to withdraw from its reasoning based on Supreme Court law that has never been directly *563 applied to immigration proceedings. Furthermore, applying the Lozada standards to this case, we find that the respondent has failed to show the requisite prejudice to warrant consideration of his late appeal. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
**9 CONCURRING OPINION: Lauri Steven Filppu, Board Member, in which Lori L. Scialabba, Chairman, joined
I respectfully concur. I agree that the respondent has not shown that we should entertain his original untimely appeal from the order of removal. Unlike the majority, however, I find no basis for distinguishing United States Supreme Court authority on the circumstances in which a party may claim ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
In Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722 (1991), and Wainwright v. Torna, 455 U.S. 586 (1982), the Supreme Court ruled that the constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel applies only to proceedings in which the government is obligated by the Constitution to provide counsel at government expense to the person subject to those proceedings. The rationale for that ruling is very simple. When the government is constitutionally required to supply counsel, it cannot effectively escape that obligation by supplying an incompetent lawyer. Since the government must provide the attorney, mistakes made by that attorney will be attributed to the government, which must bear the cost resulting from those mistakes. Coleman v. Thompson, supra, at 754; Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986).
 
On the other hand, when the government is not constitutionally required to provide counsel, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel will not lie and any mistakes made by counsel are imputed to the client. Coleman v. Thompson, supra, at 752-54. Absent a governmental obligation to supply counsel, a client is simply bound by the actions of his or her attorney, even when, as here, that attorney misses a deadline through no fault of the client. Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. P’ship, 507 U.S. 380, 396-97 (1993) (rejecting a lower court’s attempt to separate the conduct of an attorney from the consequences to the client and stating that clients must “be held accountable for the acts and omissions of their chosen counsel”); United States v. Boyle, 469 U.S. 241, 249-50 (1985) (holding that a taxpayer was not excused from filing late by reasonable reliance on the attorney handling the tax matter); Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 633 (1962) (finding “no merit to the contention that dismissal of petitioner’s claim because of his counsel’s unexcused conduct imposes an unjust penalty on the client”); see also United States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 100-01 (1985) (stating that a “filing deadline cannot be complied with, substantially or otherwise, by filing late-even by one day”).
 
**10 *564 The reasoning behind these Supreme Court decisions does not square with the large body of lower court cases, identified by the majority, finding a Fifth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel in immigration proceedings, even though the government has no constitutional obligation to provide counsel to aliens in such proceedings. Adding to the dilemma is our own case law holding that we follow circuit precedent, absent very rare circumstances. E.g., Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25 (BIA 1989). I agree with the majority that we should not lightly decline to follow circuit precedent. But neither should we decline to follow Supreme Court precedent. When the two seem to conflict, the only answer is to follow the Supreme Court, unless a valid ground for distinction emerges such that the conflict disappears.
 
Favoring lower court precedent over the Supreme Court is particularly problematic in a situation such as we have here, where only one court of appeals has ever confronted Coleman v. Thompson, supra, or Wainwright v. Torna, supra, in the civil immigration context. In that case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit expressed concern that “the Board may not be cognizant of the relevant precedents governing the right to counsel” and strongly suggested that Supreme Court law, including Coleman, was controlling. Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498, 500-01 (7th Cir. 2001).1
 
Despite its heavy emphasis on simple adherence to long-standing circuit law, the majority does hint at several possible grounds for distinguishing the Supreme Court’s rulings, but none of them is convincing. The majority explains that the Supreme Court cases were decided years ago and arose in the criminal context, and it suggests that there is a difference between the right to the effective assistance of counsel arising under the Sixth Amendment and one arising under the Fifth Amendment.
 
I do not understand the majority to say that Coleman v. Thompson, supra, a 1991 ruling, was decided so long ago that its validity today is in doubt. Instead, the majority is justifiably concerned with the number of subsequent court of appeals rulings in the immigration context that have not addressed it. But, ultimately, this concern must give way if there is not a solid analytical ground for distinction. The lower courts do not have the authority to overrule the Supreme Court. If Coleman and Wainwright are not distinguishable, it does not matter how many lower court cases, oblivious to Supreme Court law, exist. Once recognized, the Supreme Court’s rule still prevails.
 
*565 The “criminal law” distinction is also groundless. If there were an absolute dichotomy between civil and criminal cases, we should then be following the Supreme Court’s rulings in civil cases such as United States v. Boyle, supra, and Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., supra, where parties are charged with the mistakes of their lawyers. Yet the majority’s reference to a criminal law distinction may be intended to invoke a presumed contrast between the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Indeed, such a contrast would naturally suggest itself. It does not, however, actually exist in relation to the issue now before us.
 
**11 As the Supreme Court has explained, the Sixth Amendment applies only to criminal trial proceedings. It does not apply to criminal appeals. E.g., Martinez v. Court of Appeal of California, Fourth Appellate Dist., 528 U.S. 152, 159-61 (2000) (stating that in “light of our conclusion that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to appellate proceedings, any individual right to self-representation on appeal … must be grounded in the Due Process Clause”); Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.S. 387, 396 (1985) (explaining that the constitutional right to counsel during the first appeal as of right in the criminal context derives in significant part from the Due Process Clause and declaring that a “first appeal as of right therefore is not adjudicated in accord with due process of law if the appellant does not have the effective assistance of an attorney”).
 
The Sixth Amendment, consequently, is not the source of the government’s constitutional obligation to furnish counsel during a criminal defendant’s first appeal as of right. See Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600 (1974) (holding that the combination of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses does not require appointment of counsel for discretionary criminal appeals or discretionary review in the Supreme Court itself); Evitts v. Lucey, supra; Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963). Thus, the Supreme Court’s case law indicates that the differences between the Fifth and Sixth Amendments have no bearing on the fundamental question whether an individual can claim the right to the effective assistance of counsel in a given context. Instead, what matters is whether the government has a constitutional obligation to furnish counsel, regardless of the specific source of that right, whether it be the Sixth Amendment at the trial stage or a combination of due process and equal protection during the first appeal as of right in the criminal context.
 
The amici advance claims not endorsed by the majority. But the amici also fail in their further attempts to distinguish Coleman and Wainwright or to identify sources outside the Constitution for a right to the effective assistance of counsel in civil immigration proceedings. Amici seek to distinguish Coleman because of its concerns over federalism; because it involved a discretionary state appeal, as opposed to a first appeal as of right such as the regulations give to aliens in removal cases; and because the Attorney General *566 has sought to promote the competency of the immigration bar through the regulations pertaining to attorney discipline. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.101-.109, 292.3 (2002).
 
**12 Certain aspects of Coleman were influenced by federalism concerns. But, contrary to amici’s contentions, there is no indication in Coleman’s discussion of the right to “effective assistance” suggesting that the outcome depends on whether the prosecuting authority is the Federal Government or a state government. Amici are correct in noting that the death-row inmate in Coleman was attacking a procedural default, the late filing of a state appeal by his lawyer, occurring after the functional equivalent of his first appeal as of right. The controlling factor, however, was the absence of a constitutional obligation on the state to provide counsel at the stage where the procedural default occurred. In this respect, Coleman is not distinguishable from the respondent’s case, but rather is similar, because the collateral nature of Coleman’s proceedings meant that the state government was not constitutionally required to provide counsel to Coleman, just as the Government is not constitutionally required to provide counsel to the respondent in this removal proceeding. The respondent thus stands on the same constitutional footing as did Coleman when it comes to the question whether either of them has the right to the effective assistance of counsel. See Evitts v. Lucey, supra, at 396 n.7.
 
As for amici’s reference to the attorney discipline regulations, this is similar to amici’s argument that there is either a statutory or regulatory basis for finding a right to the effective assistance of counsel in civil immigration cases, even though the Constitution may not provide such a right. In removal proceedings, a respondent has the “privilege” of being represented, “at no expense to the Government.” Sections 240(b)(4)(A), 292 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(4)(A), 1362 (2000). This, however, does not imply a right to competent counsel. See Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.S. 551 (1987) (indicating that the conduct of counsel appointed under state law, but not constitutionally mandated, is not to be measured against the standard for constitutionally effective counsel); Taylor v. Dickel, 293 F.3d 427, 431 (8th Cir. 2002) (finding no statutory right to effective assistance of counsel in a civil case); Stanciel v. Gramley, 267 F.3d 575, 580-81 (7th Cir. 2001) (same); Father & Sons Lumber and Bldg. Supplies, Inc. v. NLRB, 931 F.2d 1093, 1097 (6th Cir. 1991) (finding no statutory right to effective assistance of counsel under the Administrative Procedures Act). If a statutory right to counsel is not sufficient to create a right to the effective assistance of counsel, it follows that regulatory provisions dealing with attorney discipline provide no stronger footing for such a claim.2
 
**13 *567 In sum, neither the majority nor amici offer a convincing basis for distinguishing Coleman v. Thompson, supra, and Wainwright v. Torna, supra, in the context of removal proceedings. The procedures we established in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for setting forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim were founded on the assumption that aliens have a Fifth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel in immigration proceedings. That assumption, however, is not supported by Supreme Court case law.
 
Still, this does not end the inquiry. As the majority explains, we could take the respondent’s original late appeal using our certification powers. 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(c), 3.7 (2002); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002) (stating that the certification authority is limited to “exceptional” situations and is not intended as a general cure for filing defects or for circumventing the regulations, even when enforcing them results in hardship); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (same, but addressing our sua sponte reopening powers). Further, the majority could retain the procedural tests announced in Matter of Lozada, supra, in connection with any case where attorney error or misconduct lies at the heart of our consideration of the case for certification.
 
The reasons identified by the majority at the end of its decision are more than sufficient for us to decline to certify the respondent’s original late appeal in this case. Because of its acceptance of circuit court case law, however, the majority necessarily focuses on whether due process requires us to take the late appeal, as opposed to focusing on considerations pertaining to certification under the regulations. The difference, moreover, is likely to be of meaningful consequence.
 
For example, the majority’s determination that the respondent has a Fifth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel in his removal case forces the majority to address the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 483-86 (2000) (holding, in a criminal case involving a first appeal as of right, that when counsel files a late appeal that “deprives a defendant of an appeal that he otherwise would have taken, the defendant has made out a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim entitling him to an appeal” without the need to show any additional prejudice in relation to the appeal).
 
*568 The majority is correct that Fifth Amendment due process would not necessarily require identical procedures in different categories of cases. So it is not clear that the ruling in Roe v. Flores-Ortega, supra, respecting the nature of the prejudice needed in cases of untimely appeals, would extend to removal proceedings, even assuming the right to effective assistance of counsel. But the majority itself recognizes that there already seems to be a circuit split on this very subject, leading potentially to different procedures in different circuits. Compare Hernandez v. Reno, 238 F.3d 50 (1st Cir. 2001) (declining to rigidly follow Roe v. Flores-Ortega in the immigration context), with Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir. 2000) (applying Roe v. Flores-Ortega in the context of an untimely review petition in an immigration case).
 
**14 None of this would matter, however, if the majority’s focus were on our independent certification power instead of the requirements of due process. Further, some level of review of the underlying merits of a late appeal seems inherent in either the majority’s approach or in the exercise of discretion involving certification. But, as Matter of Jean, supra, makes clear, the ordinary hardships arising from an untimely appeal would not warrant certification, meaning that our review could be more selective, with a focus on the needed exceptional situation.
 
The majority’s approach, as applied in this case, seems more focused on a simple assessment of whether there was any merit to the underlying late appeal. The point of an appeal deadline, however, would be substantially undermined for cases involving counsel if the deadline could be overcome by a simple showing of some merit to the appeal after compliance with the procedural steps required by Lozada.
 
As for Board Member Pauley’s approach to retaining Lozada by analogy to Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428 (2000), we are not the Supreme Court. Board Member Pauley acknowledges that the foundations of Lozada could be wrong. But he declines to examine Supreme Court law, because he believes we should adhere to a widely accepted past precedent such as Lozada, regardless of whether it is a correct reflection of the law. While I agree that we should not lightly abandon precedents, we do not speak with authority on issues of constitutional law. Further, our pronouncements in Lozada on the procedures for presenting a constitutionally based claim are not even fully respected by all courts of appeals. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). Perhaps most significantly, Board Member Pauley’s approach would seem to require us to override the outcome dictated by statute in some future cases, based on the failings of counsel in those cases, without even identifying the specific source of our authority for such action. The stature of a Board precedent implementing constitutional rulings from the courts of appeals is not, by itself, a sufficient basis for departing  *569 from the dictates of the statute and regulations when Supreme Court law reflects that our precedent does not stand on firm ground.
 
In the end, we are an administrative tribunal, and we are bound by the authority of higher courts. It is disconcerting when we confront two lines of seemingly irreconcilable higher authority and when we must choose between them. But, in the absence of an analytically sound basis for distinction, I do not believe we would show disrespect to the courts of appeals if we were to follow the direction of the Supreme Court.
 
**15 I would dismiss the current appeal for these reasons.
 
CONCURRING OPINION: Roger A. Pauley, Board Member
I join part III.C. of the majority opinion but cannot join part III.B. as a basis for continuing to apply Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Carefully examined, the majority opinion declines to declare that Matter of Lozada rightfully rests on a constitutional footing. Instead, it observes (1) that the United States Supreme Court decisions relied on for the contrary view, as espoused by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and Board Member Filppu, were decided in a different, i.e., criminal law, context; and (2) that all but one of the circuits to have considered Lozada’s underpinnings, including the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this case arises, have concluded (albeit without citing those Supreme Court decisions) that Lozada is grounded on Fifth Amendment due process principles. The majority then find, on the authority of Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25 (BIA 1989), and Matter of Martin, 23 I&N Dec. 491 (BIA 2002), that the Board is without power to consider the Service’s argument because accepting it would represent the Board’s finding that the courts of appeals “that have analyzed the issue … have reached an incorrect result.” Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 560 (BIA 2003). Such a conclusion, the majority determine, is “beyond” the Board’s limited authority as an administrative decision-making body. Id.
 
**16 I cannot subscribe to this reasoning. Nothing in Matter of Anselmo, supra, Matter of Martin, supra, or any other precedent decision of the Board supports, much less mandates, the rather astonishing proposition that we must defer to courts of appeals rulings that are at odds with (and that do not even acknowledge) governing Supreme Court decisions. Indeed, Matter of Anselmo itself discusses and distinguishes with approval a precedent in which the Board refused to apply a court of appeals decision, precisely because the issue was before the Supreme Court and had been challenged by the Solicitor General. Matter of Mangabat, 14 I&N Dec. 75 (BIA 1972), aff’d sub nom. Cabuco-Flores v. INS, 477 F.2d 108 (9th Cir. 1973). It is axiomatic that Supreme Court decisions are the “law of the land” and take precedence over *570 pronouncements by lower federal courts. While we have properly determined that, in the normal course of events, a court of appeals decision is binding upon us for cases arising in that circuit, to find that we are bound by that rule where the appellate court has itself failed to follow a governing Supreme Court decision would not only derogate from the authority of the Supreme Court, it would tend, in many cases, to prevent the Court from ever having an opportunity to review the issue.
 
Were it not, therefore, for the ground on which I concur in the majority’s result, I would find myself, as does Board Member Filppu, compelled to consider and to determine whether the Supreme Court’s rulings on the constitutional scope of the right to counsel support the Board’s Lozada ruling, and if not, whether any statutory or other basis properly exists therefor. Moreover, in that circumstance, I might well join Board Member Filppu in concluding that its legal foundations, if any, lie in quicksand.1
 
In my view, however, the proper outcome of this case is dictated by adherence to the principle of stare decisis. While the legal basis of Matter of Lozada, supra, is unclear, and is deliberately left so by the majority’s opinion, that is not sufficient reason to abandon it as a precedent. The Supreme Court was recently faced with a similar situation in Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428 (2000), where a substantial challenge was mounted to the constitutional foundation of the Court’s decision in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), that before custodial interrogation by law enforcement may be conducted, certain warnings of rights must be administered. The majority, however, failed to reach the merits and declined on stare decisis grounds to overrule Miranda, finding that its requirement of warnings had become “embedded” in police practice. Dickerson v. United States, supra, at 430.
 
**17 The requirements of Lozada are hardly as entrenched in our national culture as are the Miranda warnings, and Lozada has only been on the books for some 15 years, in contrast to Miranda’s 34 years when Dickerson was decided. Nevertheless, Lozada has generated, in that period, an all but universal degree of acceptance and adherence in the country, and it has *571 become “embedded” in immigration law and practice through application by immigration law practitioners, Immigration Judges, and the courts in thousands of cases. Moreover, in contrast to the situation in Dickerson, where, shortly after Miranda was issued, Congress enacted a statute embodying its disagreement that warnings are a constitutionally necessary ingredient for determining the admissibility of statements given during custodial interrogation, it is noteworthy that Congress has not seen fit to even attempt to reject or modify Lozada through legislation, despite having passed major immigration reforms in the years since it was decided.
 
Therefore, whether or not I would have agreed with Lozada’s “reasoning and its rule in the first instance, stare decisis weighs heavily against overruling it now.” Dickerson v. United States, supra, at 429; cf. Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253, 268 (BIA 2002) (Pauley, dissenting). Finally, Lozada’s rule may well have served to improve the quality of legal representation afforded to aliens in immigration proceedings and thus, like the warnings required by Miranda, the effect of Lozada does not provide the “special justification” the Supreme Court has held is necessary to justify overturning an established precedent. Dickerson v. United States, supra, at 429.2
 
I therefore agree with the majority that Lozada remains applicable to the respondent’s case. But as earlier noted, I also join in the majority’s holding, in accordance with a decision from the First Circuit,3 which initially affirmed Lozada, that the respondent needed to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice from the ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to file a timely notice of appeal, but he did not do so. Accordingly, I concur in the order dismissing his appeal.

We acknowledge the thoughtful arguments raised in the supplemental briefs submitted by amici curiae and the Immigration and Naturalization Service in response to our request for additional briefing. We have considered both of the amici briefs dated April 23, 2001, and February 26, 2002, even though the former brief was not submitted directly in relation to the case now before us.

The respondent was competently represented by counsel at the hearing before the Immigration Judge. After the conclusion of those proceedings, however, the respondent apparently dismissed that attorney and retained new counsel. It was the second attorney who filed the appeal late and who is the subject of the present ineffective assistance claim filed by the respondent’s current counsel.

3

The Immigration Judge’s order became final when the respondent’s appeal was not timely filed. See section 101(a)(47)(B)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(47)(B)(ii) (2000) (providing that a deportation order becomes final upon the expiration of the period in which the alien is permitted to seek review by the Board); 8 C.F.R. § 3.38(b) (2002) (specifying that an appeal must be filed within 30 days); 8 C.F.R. § 3.3(a)(1) (2002) (describing how an appeal may be taken to the Board); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373, 378 (A.G. 2002).

4

The Service asserts that the respondent should have filed his motion to reopen with the Board, rather than with the Immigration Judge. We need not address the Service’s procedural objections, because we view the issues posed by this case to be sufficiently important for us to review pursuant to our independent authority to certify, reopen, or reconsider a case. 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(c), 3.2(a) (2002); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that the Board uses its authority to reopen or reconsider cases sparingly, in “truly exceptional” situations). Our invocation of these powers extinguishes any procedural questions pertaining to the timeliness of the respondent’s Lozada motion or to the forum in which it is filed.

5

In light of our disposition of this case, we find it unnecessary to address whether there is a statutory basis in the Immigration and Nationality Act for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See sections 240(b)(4)(A), 292 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(4)(A), 1362 (2000) (stating that a respondent has the “privilege” of being represented, “at no expense to the Government”). We also do not reach the argument advanced by amici that claims of ineffective assistance derive from regulations of the Executive Office for Immigration Review that enforce standards of conduct for those appearing before Immigration Judges and the Board. See Professional Conduct for Practitioners — Rules and Procedures, 65 Fed. Reg. 39,513 (2000).

6

We acknowledge that some courts have taken a “broad” view of the Lozada requirements, holding that we should apply a flexible approach by not mandating strict adherence to all of the Lozada steps in every case. See Xu Yong Lu v. Ashcroft, supra, at 134 (noting that while in many, if not most, cases, persons alleging ineffective assistance should file disciplinary complaints, this is not an “absolute” requirement); Saakian v. INS, supra (endorsing a flexible approach to Matter of Lozada); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that the Lozada requirements are generally reasonable, but that full compliance is not required if the record independently shows that the “ineffective assistance” claim is legitimate and substantial). We will apply such circuit law as is appropriate in each circuit. However, because the respondent in the present case fully complied with the Lozada steps, we find it unnecessary to consider whether to apply this “flexible” approach generally to all cases.

7

According to Judge Wood’s concurring opinion in Stroe v. INS, supra, at 505, “[A]s the Supreme Court constantly reminds us, due process is a flexible concept, and I see no reason to make a categorical assumption that it will never be implicated in a counsel-related problem in an immigration case.”

8

We also note that the current regulations governing asylum claims specifically include ineffective assistance of counsel as a potential exception to the 1-year deadline for filing asylum applications. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.4(a)(5)(iii) (2002) (providing that ineffective assistance of counsel may constitute “extraordinary circumstances” excusing a failure to file an asylum application within the 1-year deadline). These regulations mandate that an alien claiming such circumstances must comply with the procedural steps of Matter of Lozada. The supplementary information to the latest revision of the asylum regulations took note of the Service’s arguments before the Board advocating a reexamination of Matter of Lozada as part of a broader assessment of the role that counsel error may play in requests for relief in immigration proceedings. Asylum Procedures, 65 Fed. Reg. 76,121, 76,124 (2000). However, the language of 8 C.F.R. § 208.4(a)(5)(iii) has remained unchanged since it was added to the asylum regulations in 1997.

In their respective concurring opinions, Board Members Filppu and Pauley, while reaching different conclusions about the effect of Coleman v. Thompson and Wainwright v. Torna make the point that the Board should follow Supreme Court authority in instances where that authority conflicts with precedents of the circuit courts. We agree. As noted above, Supreme Court law is paramount and the Board, along with every other judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal in this country, is mandated to follow it. Were we convinced of a conflict between the Supreme Court’s pronouncements and circuit court precedents, we would follow Supreme Court law without question. In this case, however, for the reasons explained in this decision, we find that the Court’s decisions in Coleman and Wainwright do not govern the question whether there is a Fifth Amendment basis for raising ineffective assistance of counsel claims in immigration proceedings, where virtually every circuit that has looked at this issue over the years has not identified such a conflict with applicable circuit law. Matter of Mangabat, 14 I&N Dec. 75 (BIA 1972), aff’d sub nom. Cabuco-Flores v. INS, 477 F.2d 108 (9th Cir. 1973), cited by Board Member Pauley, is not applicable to this case, as it involved a unique situation where the Solicitor General was affirmatively challenging circuit court precedent before the Supreme Court. That is not the situation here.

10

As noted earlier, the respondent was represented by one attorney before the Immigration Judge, but he hired a different attorney to file his appeal with the Board. See supra note 2.

1

The court in Stroe described its own older case law, as well as that from most other circuits, as having “assumed” the existence in immigration cases of a right to the effective assistance of counsel. Stroe v. INS, supra, at 499-500; see also Pop v. INS, 279 F.3d 457, 460 (7th Cir. 2002) (citing Stroe and stating that “[in] this circuit, … whether there exists a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in immigration cases is virtually foreclosed”). Stroe should give the majority great pause before giving precedence to older circuit law in Seventh Circuit cases.

2

Amici also advance an “equitable tolling” claim as to the motion to reopen issues in this case, but not as to the original untimely appeal, which forms the basis for the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Statutes of limitation are subject to tolling but jurisdictional provisions are not. See Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385 (1982); Davis v. Johnson, 158 F.3d 806 (5th Cir. 1998). Our appeal deadline is a jurisdictional provision. Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591, 592 (BIA 1974) (stating that dismissal of an appeal as untimely “was solely for lack of jurisdiction”); see also Matter of Escobar, 18 I&N Dec. 412 (BIA 1983) (addressing timeliness as a question of jurisdiction over the appeal).

The majority disregard the Supreme Court decisions on which Board Member Filppu and the Service rely because they were rendered in a different, i.e., criminal law, context. This, however, is not a sufficient basis of distinction. Generally speaking, criminal defendants enjoy the protection of constitutional guarantees of the right to counsel and due process of law to a greater extent than do aliens in civil immigration proceedings. The majority recognize this principle—indeed they accord it determinative effect—when they find that the automatic prejudice rule that the Supreme Court itself has held applies in the criminal context to counsel’s failure to file a timely appeal does not apply in this case. But the majority unaccountably fail to apply the same principle to the Supreme Court’s due process decisions regarding the right to effective assistance of counsel or to explain why limitations on that right acknowledged by the Supreme Court in the criminal context do not apply, a fortiori, in immigration proceedings.

2

Board Member Filppu criticizes this approach because “we are not the Supreme Court” and “do not speak with authority on issues of constitutional law.” Matter of Assaad, supra, at 568 (Filppu, concurring). I do not find these facts to weaken the propriety of relying on stare decisis principles as a basis for deciding this case. Presumably, Board Member Filppu is implying that the decisions of lower tribunals should be regarded as less worthy of precedential deference by those tribunals, because of the possibility of reversal by a higher authority. But I am aware of no such doctrine. Rather, the extent of reliance on settled questions of law, which as noted above is great in this case, plays the major part in stare decisis. In short, stare decisis is not only for the Supreme Court. See, e.g., EEOC v. Trabucco, 791 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1986).

**1 *1216 (1) Where an alien has filed an untimely motion to reopen alleging that the Immigration and Naturalization Service failed to prove the alien’s removability, the burden of proof no longer lies with the Service to establish removability, but shifts to the alien to demonstrate that an exceptional situation exists that warrants reopening by the Board of Immigration Appeals on its own motion.
 
(2) Where an alien seeking to reopen removal proceedings failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood that the result in his case would be changed if the proceedings were reopened, by showing that he was not, in fact, removable, he failed to present an exceptional situation to warrant a grant of his untimely motion.

HURWITZ, Board Member:
 
This case was before us on December 29, 1998, when we dismissed an appeal taken from an Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. On July 2, 1999, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. This motion is untimely and will be denied.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Jamaica who entered the United States in 1972 as a lawful permanent resident. A Notice to Appear (Form I-862) was issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service on April 22, 1997, charging him with removability as an aggravated felon *1217 under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (Supp. II 1996). This charge was based on a July 8, 1996, conviction in the State of Connecticut. The record before us contains an “Information” regarding the respondent’s conviction, which reveals that the respondent was convicted, upon a plea of guilty, of “Poss w/ intent to sell” in violation of section 21a-277(a) of the Connecticut General Statutes. That statutory provision relates to “any controlled substance which is a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, or a narcotic substance.” Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 21a-277(a) (West 1995). The respondent was sentenced to 27 months’ confinement for his offense.
 
Removal proceedings were commenced on October 28, 1997, but were continued to enable the respondent to obtain counsel. At the continued hearing, the respondent again appeared without counsel. The Immigration Judge questioned him regarding the allegations in the Notice to Appear, including the allegation that the respondent was, “on July 8, 1996, convicted in the Superior Court at New Haven, CT for the offense of possession of narcotics with intent to sell, in violation of Section 21a-277(a) of the Connecticut General Statutes.” The respondent admitted that allegation. The respondent then stated that he had obtained an attorney. The Immigration Judge noted that no attorney had filed a notice of appearance, but he continued the hearing to a later date.
 
**2 The proceedings went forward and were completed on March 9, 1998. On that date, the Immigration Judge asked the respondent whether he had been convicted on July 8, 1996, of “possession of narcotics with intent to sell.” The respondent again stated that he had been so convicted. The Immigration Judge then entered an order finding the respondent removable and ordering his removal to Jamaica. A timely appeal was filed, which argued that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion and did not take into account the respondent’s family in the United States, his military service in the United States Marines, and the nature of the charge against him. The respondent also alleged that he believed his state court conviction “was improper.” As noted above, we dismissed that appeal on December 29, 1998.
 
More than 6 months after our decision, the respondent filed his motion to reopen. This motion made a number of claims regarding ineffective assistance of counsel and the alleged inadequacy of proof of the respondent’s removability.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is clearly untimely. Under the regulations, a motion to reopen must be filed “no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.” 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(c)(2) (1999). In our precedent decision in Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), we emphasized the importance of the time limits on motions to reopen, noting the need to discourage dilatory motions and Congress’ mandate that we issue regulations to do so. We did recognize that we retained “limited discretionary *1218 powers” to reopen or reconsider cases on our own motion. Id. at 984. However, we cautioned that such powers should be exercised only in “exceptional situations.” Id. We further indicated that it is the respondent’s burden to demonstrate that such a situation exists. Id. at 984-85. An exceptional situation has not been shown in this case.
 
The respondent admitted at his removal hearing that he was convicted of a narcotics offense. This admission came when the Immigration Judge had the respondent plead to the allegations contained in the Notice to Appear, as required by the regulations. See 8 C.F.R. § 240.10(c) (1998). In fact, twice during the proceedings, at separate occasions on different days, the respondent admitted to having a narcotics conviction. These admissions, together with the record of conviction, adequately establish the respondent’s removability.
 
Moreover, and more importantly, the issue before us in this untimely motion is not, as framed by the respondent, whether the Service has met its burden of proof to establish that the respondent is removable as an aggravated felon. It is whether the respondent has met his burden of showing an exceptional situation that warrants our considering this untimely motion.
 
The respondent has failed to overcome the untimeliness of his motion by demonstrating that an exceptional situation exists. In his brief in support of the motion to reopen, he makes detailed legal arguments explaining why he believes the Service did not meet its burden of proof at the hearing. These arguments miss the point that the issue now before us is not whether the Service met its burden of proof at the hearing. In fact, at no point in his motion papers does the respondent even recognize that his motion is untimely, and no effort has been made to overcome the untimeliness problem.
 
**3 The current posture of this case is critical to our decision. Were this case now before us on direct appeal, we might be inclined to remand for a further hearing. However, the fact that this is an untimely motion necessarily changes our point of view. A criminal defendant is initially the beneficiary of the rule that the government must prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. However, once having been found guilty, the defendant bears the burden of proof if he wishes to attack that finding. See generally Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 400, 414 (1988). Similarly, the Service initially bears the burden of proof in a removal proceeding, but once an alien is found removable (and that finding is upheld on appeal, if an appeal is taken), the burden shifts to the alien who wishes to attack that finding. We note that, even where a motion to reopen is not untimely, the motion will not be granted unless there is a reasonable likelihood of success upon reopening. See generally Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996); see also INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992) (indicating that motions to reopen in immigration proceedings are disfavored); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988) (same). This is particularly so when the motion seeking further review of the finding is untimely.
 
*1219 The respondent in this case has not even attempted to claim, much less established, that he is not, in fact, removable. He has stated that the Service failed to prove that he was convicted of an offense involving narcotics or a controlled substance that would render him removable as an aggravated felon. However, he has not alleged, much less proved, that the controlled substance involved in his offense was one that would not render him removable. He has not raised an actual defense to the charge against him. He has suggested a potential theory under which he conceivably might not be removable as an aggravated felon. However, he has not taken the next, and critical, step of showing how the theory applies to his case. He has not, for example, produced any part of the record of conviction that might show what substance was involved in his conviction, and why that substance would not render him removable as an aggravated felon. He has not even claimed in his motion, by affidavit or otherwise, that his offense involved such a substance. At this point, we require such an affirmative showing from the respondent.
 
In fact, rather than stating what substance was involved in his offense and arguing that substance would not render him removable as charged, the respondent submitted an affidavit in support of his motion that further supports the finding of removability. In a sworn statement dated May 27, 1999, the respondent states that he was charged in Connecticut “with possession with intent to sell narcotics.” Thus, the respondent’s own motion papers would actually support a finding of removability. He has not attempted to prove that he is not actually removable as charged because he cannot make such a showing.
 
**4 To warrant our taking this untimely motion sua sponte, the respondent needed to show the existence of an exceptional situation. Notwithstanding any possible problems with the Immigration Judge’s handling of the hearing or with the actions (or inaction) of previous counsel, the respondent, at a minimum, needed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood that the result in his case would be changed if reopening is granted. The respondent has made no such showing. His motion must therefore be denied as untimely.
 
In the dissenting opinions, Chairman Schmidt and Board Member Rosenberg urge us to accept this untimely motion by arguing that failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice. We need not decide today whether this may, under some circumstances, be a proper basis for accepting an untimely motion, because the respondent has not shown that a miscarriage of justice will result if his motion is denied. Although the respondent has filed briefs and considerable documentation in support of his motion, to date he has not filed anything that would suggest that his conviction does not, in fact, constitute an aggravated felony conviction that renders him removable.
 
In her dissent, Board Member Rosenberg cites Matter of Roman, 19 I&N Dec. 855 (BIA 1988), and *1220 Matter of Malone, 11 I&N Dec. 730 (BIA 1966). Such references are unavailing. In Matter of Roman, we stated that an alien may collaterally attack a final order of deportation in a subsequent deportation hearing, but “only if she can show that the prior order resulted in a gross miscarriage of justice.” Id. at 856-57. No such showing was made in that case because the respondent had admitted the allegations and conceded deportability at the previous hearing.
 
In Matter of Malone, supra, we allowed a collateral attack on an order of deportation because we found that the earlier finding of deportability was “not in accord with the law as interpreted at that time.” Id. at 732. We concluded that to allow such a finding to stand would result in a gross miscarriage of justice. Here, by contrast, the respondent has presented nothing to persuade us that to remove him from this country would be in violation of law or otherwise a gross miscarriage of justice. To the contrary, the respondent here has conceded the allegations in the Notice to Appear and has provided nothing to suggest that he is not actually removable as charged.
 
The Rosenberg dissent also cites to our decisions in Matter of Pichardo, 21 I&N Dec. 330 (BIA 1996), and Matter of Teixeira, 21 I&N Dec. 316 (BIA 1996). In those cases, we held that where an alien has been convicted under a statute that encompasses both crimes that constitute firearms offenses and those that do not, we will not rely on the alien’s testimony to determine whether his offense actually involved a firearm, but will look to the record of conviction to make that determination. Reliance on these cases suffers from the same infirmity as the respondent’s other arguments: it does not recognize the current posture of the case and the unassailable fact that the burden now rests with the respondent. We note further that those cases do not establish that an alien’s pleadings to factual allegations in the charging document may be insufficient to reflect the portion of a divisible statute under which he was convicted. Those decisions merely indicate that separate testimony, not pleadings, is not sufficient to prove the nature of the conviction.
 
**5 Contrary to the assertion in the Rosenberg dissent, the respondent’s admissions to the factual allegations in the Notice to Appear are not contradicted by the record of conviction presented by the Service. The record of conviction refers to a Connecticut statute and that statute, in turn, refers to narcotics. While the statute also encompasses controlled substances other than narcotics, it clearly does include narcotic drugs, and the respondent admitted to having a conviction involving narcotics. This admission is, in fact, fully consistent with the record of conviction.
 
The Rosenberg dissent states that we have ignored the substantive issues raised in the respondent’s motion and instead have denied the motion “on purely administrative grounds under the regulations.” Matter of Beckford, Interim Decision 3425, at 10 (BIA 2000) (Rosenberg, dissenting). We do not view the regulations that set forth strict time and number limits on motions as merely “administrative.” The regulations at issue were *1221 promulgated by the Attorney General, and we are required to give them the full force and effect of law. See section 103(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a) (Supp. II 1996); Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25 (BIA 1989), and cases cited therein. Moreover, the time and number restrictions on motions were clearly mandated by Congress and were promulgated in direct response to Congress’ command. See Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, § 545(d), 104 Stat. 4978, 5066; Motions and Appeals in Immigration Proceedings, 61 Fed. Reg. 18,900 (1996); see also Matter of G-D-, Interim Decision 3418 (BIA 1999).
 
When Congress directed the Attorney General to promulgate regulations limiting motions to reopen and reconsider, it clearly sought to (1) limit the ability of aliens to file motions, and (2) bring finality to immigration proceedings. Board Member Rosenberg’s view of the Attorney General’s regulations defeats these purposes and would be contrary to the congressional mandate.
 
The respondent’s arguments regarding ineffective assistance of counsel ignore the fact that this is an untimely motion. Had the respondent raised these issues within the time limits for motions, we might have considered granting the motion, though it would still have suffered from the infirmity that the respondent has failed to offer anything to show that he is not, in fact, removable. At this juncture, however, and for the reasons discussed above, we see no basis for granting this untimely motion because of the problems with the respondent’s prior counsel.
 
We have noted the parties’ arguments regarding Matter of Mena, 17 I&N Dec. 38 (BIA 1979), and Matter of Paulus, 11 I&N Dec. 274 (BIA 1965). We asked the parties to brief their positions on these cases when we granted the respondent’s request for a stay of removal. We find that these cases are also distinguishable from the present case, because both involved appeals on the merits where the burden of proof was on the Service.
 
**6 For the foregoing reasons, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
DISSENTING OPINION: Paul W. Schmidt, Chairman; in which Fred W. Vacca, Board Member, joined
I respectfully dissent.
 
Removal of the respondent under these circumstances would be a miscarriage of justice. I therefore find this to be an exceptional situation warranting reopening on our own motion under Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
The respondent’s prior attorney failed to appear at the removal proceeding before the Immigration Judge. He further failed to represent the respondent on appeal and appears to have misrepresented his actions to the respondent. The respondent filed a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel *1222 that complies with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 638 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
At the removal hearing, the Immigration and Naturalization Service did not establish that the respondent’s conviction under Connecticut law involved a substance that would be considered a controlled substance under federal law. In fact, the Service never established what particular substance was involved in the Connecticut conviction.
 
The unrepresented respondent “admitted” to the Immigration Judge that he had been convicted of “possession of narcotics with intent to sell.” Contrary to the majority’s suggestion, that simple statement by an unrepresented respondent cannot fairly be treated as a knowing and intelligent admission that he was convicted of possession with intent to sell a narcotic drug under Connecticut law that also would be considered a controlled substance under federal law.
 
The respondent’s removability as an aggravated felon has not been established by the statutorily required clear and convincing evidence. It is clear, however, that the respondent was prejudiced by the failure of his attorney to represent him at the removal hearing or on appeal.
 
Moreover, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this case arises, has found the violation of a fundamental constitutional or statutory right to be inherently prejudicial. See Waldron v. INS, 17 F.3d 511 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1014 (1994); cf. Matter of Hernandez, 21 I&N Dec. 224, 227 (BIA 1996) (acknowledging Waldron, but finding that an explanation of an Order to Show Cause by the Service at the time of personal service does not implicate a fundamental right). The right to effective representation by one’s retained attorney is such a fundamental right. See Montilla v. INS, 926 F.2d 162 (2d Cir. 1991) (holding that a remand was required where regulations regarding an alien’s right to counsel in deportation proceedings were violated).
 
The respondent is undoubtedly a criminal. It is also uncontested that he has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States for 27 years, has served in the United States Marine Corps, has two United States citizen children, and also has parents and siblings who are United States citizens. Thus, his stake in this country is very substantial. I would not remove him unless satisfied that the charge of deportability has been properly proved by the Service following a fundamentally fair hearing.
 
**7 For the foregoing reasons, I find that the respondent’s removal under current circumstances would be a miscarriage of justice. I would therefore grant his motion to reopen under Matter of J-J-, supra, and remand the case to the Immigration Judge so that the respondent’s removability can be fairly and properly determined. Consequently, I respectfully dissent.
DISSENTING OPINION: Lory Diana Rosenberg, Board Member
 
*1223 I respectfully dissent.
 
The record reflects an unfair hearing before the Immigration Judge, an unfair disposition of the charges, and an unfair review of the Immigration Judge’s decision on appeal before the Board. This is due in part to certain errors made by the Immigration Judge below, and due in part to the absolute failure of the respondent’s original counsel to appear and properly represent him. Nevertheless, the majority invokes our restricted administrative discretion under the regulations governing motions to reopen not filed within 90 days as its basis for declining to right these wrongs.
 
We should not be blinded by our commitment to the regulatory time and number limits on motions to reopen removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(c) (1999). In refusing to remand the respondent’s case to the Immigration Judge to allow him to be represented by counsel in a fair hearing before being ordered removed from the United States, the majority has lost sight of the larger picture. The majority closes its eyes to three critical points:
(1) A lawful permanent resident, who has lived in the United States for 27 years and has other compelling equities, is about to be removed with no hope of return to the United States.
(2) The Immigration and Naturalization Service was effectively relieved, in the hearing below, of its burden of proving that the respondent was convicted, as it had alleged, and removable, as it had charged, under the statute.
(3) The respondent had a valid challenge to the charges levied by the Service and to the ruling of the Immigration Judge, but was denied effective counsel at his removal hearing and on appeal to the Board.
 
As a result of the majority’s refusal to remand this case, the possibility of accommodating due process or achieving justice in removal proceedings simply falls by the wayside. It becomes nothing more than an ideal that looks good on paper and means little in practice. I cannot join the majority in elevating the regulations and limiting our intervention, rather than reopening, when doing so could achieve a just result. Therefore, I dissent.
 
I. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS
The respondent is a former United States Marine who has lived lawfully in the United States for 27 years. He is the parent of two United States citizen children. Through no fault of his own, he was unrepresented at the removal hearing below and on appeal and is subject to a final order of removal dated December 29, 1998.
 
On July 23, 1999, we granted a temporary stay of execution of the removal order and asked the Service to respond to the respondent’s argument *1224 that the state statute under which he was convicted is divisible, and that our precedent decisions in Matter of Mena, 17 I&N Dec. 38 (BIA 1979), and Matter of Paulus, 11 I&N Dec. 274 (BIA 1965), control the disposition of his case. The majority essentially obviates that order, ignores the substantive issues before us, and denies the motion on purely administrative grounds under the regulations.
 
A. Right to Counsel
**8 The respondent is the unfortunate subject of a continued removal hearing, in which the Immigration Judge disregarded his earlier order issued October 28, 1997, continuing the case to allow the respondent to obtain counsel. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 240.6, 240.10(a)(1) (1998); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.16; 3.29 (1998) (allowing representation by counsel at the respondent’s own expense and authorizing a continuance for good cause shown). Ostensibly, the purpose of advising a respondent that he may be represented by counsel and continuing proceedings to allow him to obtain counsel is to afford a respondent the opportunity to be represented in proceedings in which his removal may be ordered. However, at the reconvened hearing, the Immigration Judge did not inquire first whether the respondent had retained counsel to represent him in the proceedings. He simply went ahead and questioned the unrepresented respondent regarding the allegations made by the Service, finding the respondent to be removable based on his admission to the allegations in the Notice to Appear (Form I-862) prepared by the Service.
 
In fact, the respondent had retained counsel and, through his family, had paid the attorney and given him documentation relevant to his case. However, the date of the continued hearing originally set by the Immigration Judge was changed because of circumstances outside the control of the respondent, and the attorney who had been retained by the respondent failed to appear for the rescheduled hearing. The respondent insisted that he had expected to be represented. As a result, even though the Immigration Judge already had questioned the respondent and secured his admission to the allegations in the Notice to Appear, the hearing was continued.
 
At a subsequent hearing, the respondent’s attorney still failed to appear. Ignoring the fact that the respondent’s prior admissions were made in the absence of counsel, and citing the fact that no attorney had “filed anything,” the Immigration Judge had the respondent affirm the prior pleadings and issued a summary order of removal.
 
These fundamental errors--questioning the respondent and taking his pleadings to the allegations in the Notice to Appear when the respondent had retained counsel, but counsel was not available to represent him--constitute significant due process violations that tainted the respondent’s *1225 removal hearing and rendered it fundamentally unfair. A removal hearing must be conducted in a manner that satisfies principles of fundamental fairness. See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 449 (1987); Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 34-35 (1982); Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580 (1952); Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 154 (1945) (emphasizing that deportation “visits a great hardship on the individual” and recognizing that “(m)eticulous care must be exercised lest the procedure by which he is deprived of that liberty not meet the essential standards of fairness”); see also Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d 879 (2d Cir. 1994).
 
**9 The regulation requiring the Immigration Judge to advise a respondent of his right to be represented by counsel at his or her own expense, and the Immigration Judge’s order continuing the proceedings to allow the respondent to obtain counsel, each reflect administrative mechanisms that protect fundamental rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. See Montilla v. INS, 926 F.2d 162 (2d Cir. 1991). The instant case does not present a situation in which the respondent had been granted more than one continuance to obtain counsel and the Immigration Judge denied a further continuance. Cf. 8 C.F.R. § 3.16. Rather, it reflects an error on the part of the Immigration Judge, who required the respondent to plead to the allegations lodged by the Service, without ever inquiring whether the respondent had obtained representation or was represented by counsel, and in violation of the right to be represented by counsel.
 
Denial of the right to be represented by counsel calls into question the fairness of the proceedings, and deviation from these fundamental rights is considered inherently prejudicial in the circuit in which this motion arises. See Waldron v. INS, 17 F.3d 511, 518 (2d Cir. 1993). A decision rendered in the course of such proceedings cannot support an order of removal. B. Offense Underlying the Conviction
 
Complicating this questionable order of events in the hearing below is a criminal “Information” issued by the Superior Court of Connecticut, which was submitted by the Service in the initial hearing and eventually made part of the record. This document indicates that on October 24, 1995, the respondent pled guilty to and was convicted of a violation of Connecticut state law--“Poss. w/ intent to sell” under “§ 21a-2779 (sic) ” of the Connecticut General Statutes. Apparently, as a result of this conviction, the Service alleged and charged in the Notice to Appear issued on April 22, 1997, that he was removable from the United States because he was “on July 8 1996, convicted . . . for the offense of possession of narcotics with intent to sell.”
 
The regulations require the Immigration Judge to read the factual allegations and the charges in the Notice to Appear to the respondent and to *1226 explain them in nontechnical language. 8 C.F.R. § 240.10(a)(6) (1999). Although the Immigration Judge broadly summarized the allegations at the initial hearing, he glossed over the distinction between the allegation in the Notice to Appear that narcotics were involved and the actual language on the respondent’s conviction record, which indicates only that the offense involved a controlled substance.
 
This is a distinction with an express difference. To constitute a controlled substance conviction that triggers removability, a conviction must be for an offense that is analogous to a federal offense, i.e., the controlled substance must be included in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act. Matter of Davis, 20 I&N Dec. 536 (BIA 1992); see also Matter of Paulus, supra (requiring specification of the particular controlled substance offense alleged to form the basis of deportability). The Connecticut statute is broader, listing controlled substances not included on the federal list.
 
**10 The court documents make clear that the respondent was not convicted of possession of narcotics with intent to sell, as charged by the Service, but that he was convicted of “Poss. w/ intent to sell.” The respondent’s admission--consisting of a “yes” to the Immigration Judge’s question, “Is that all correct?” (referring to the Service’s allegations in the Notice to Appear)--is contradicted by the record of conviction submitted by the Service itself.
 
In addition, it should be obvious that, according to the documents submitted by the Service, the respondent was convicted on October 24, 1995, and not on July 8, 1996, as charged by the Service. Rather, the conviction document, on its face, reflects that July 8, 1996, was actually the date sentence was imposed, not the date the respondent was convicted.
 
Consequently, the respondent’s agreement that the allegations in the Notice to Appear were correct cannot be deemed to establish that he was convicted of a controlled substance offense within the meaning of section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B) (Supp. II 1996). The evidence in the record is neither clear nor convincing. It is unreasonable to hold that the respondent’s “yes” satisfies the burden of proof ordinarily placed on the Service by the express terms of the statute, when the record contains evidence that is inconsistent with the allegation admitted by the respondent. See section 240(c)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A) (Supp. II 1996); see also Matter of Pichardo, 21 I&N Dec. 330 (BIA 1996) (holding that a respondent’s testimony concerning his violation of the law is not admissible and does not relieve the Service of its burden of proving that the respondent is subject to deportation or removal based on a particular conviction); Matter of Teixeira, 21 I&N Dec. 316 (BIA 1996).
 
The statute requires that substantial evidence must exist to support a finding of removability. See section 240(c)(3)(A) of the Act (“No decision on deportability shall be valid unless it is based upon reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence.”). None exists in the instant case. Although an *1227 Immigration Judge’s determination that removability has been established may be based on the admissions of the respondent, the Immigration Judge must be “satisfied” that no “issues of law or fact remain.” 8 C.F.R. § 240.10(c). This regulation offends the statute if it is used as a quick and easy way for an Immigration Judge to enter a removal order, as obviously happened here.
 
At a minimum, there are evidentiary conflicts with regard to the substantive offense of which the respondent was convicted, according to the actual conviction documents, and the date on which he was convicted. The regulations permitting an Immigration Judge to rely on a respondent’s admission must be tempered by recognition of the statutory burden of proof assigned to the Service by Congress. Given the disparities in the record, the Immigration Judge’s ruling, which was based on the respondent’s admission alone, should not have been sustained. Even at this late date, the Board is empowered to intervene to see that justice is done in such a situation, and we should intercede to prevent the respondent from being removed on the basis of his admission to an allegation that is not supported by the underlying record.
 
II. APPLICABLE STANDARDS FOR REOPENING
**11 So intent is the majority on limiting any exceptions to the restriction on untimely motions that its application of the rule swallows the exception. Cf. 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(a) (authorizing the Board to reopen a case at any time); cf. also Matter of G-D-, Interim Decision 3418 (BIA 1999) (Rosenberg, dissenting); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (Rosenberg, dissenting). However, the interests of justice--put off by the majority for another day--warrant our adjudicating the respondent’s motion on its merits and remanding his case to the Immigration Judge for a fair hearing.
 
The alternative--removal of a long-term lawful permanent resident on a record in which the Service has not met its burden of establishing removability by clear and convincing evidence--would result in a gross miscarriage of justice. See Matter of Roman, 19 I&N Dec. 855 (BIA 1988) (recognizing that a final order of deportation or exclusion may be attacked upon a showing that the prior order resulted in a gross miscarriage of justice); Matter of Malone, 11 I&N Dec. 730 (BIA 1966) (finding that the validity of the deportation order can and must be examined where the record reveals that the Service failed to sustain its burden of proof). The circumstances presented by the respondent’s motion to reopen should be considered but one situation in which the Board, in the exercise of its discretion, may elect to assert jurisdiction over a motion that does not comport with the regulations. See Matter of J-J-, supra.
 
*1228 A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel as a Basis To Reopen Proceedings I do not dispute that the respondent bears the burden of demonstrating that his case should be reopened. However, ineffective assistance of counsel may form the basis on which the Board will grant a motion to reopen. Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). In general, to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a respondent must satisfy the three-pronged screening test articulated in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), by showing (1) that he had an agreement with his former attorney to provide representation, and how the attorney failed to meet that agreement; (2) that he notified his former attorney of the allegations of ineffective assistance he is making against him; and (3) that he lodged a complaint against his former attorney with the state disciplinary authority. The respondent has established ineffective assistance of counsel under the Board’s Lozada test by providing evidence that he had retained counsel and had an agreement for representation, that the agreement was breached, that he confronted prior counsel regarding the breach, and that he filed a complaint with the state bar authorities. Id.; see also Matter of N-K-and V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997).
Moreover, according to the law of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, ineffective assistance of counsel may form a basis on which to determine that due process has been violated, even in the absence of a specific Lozada claim. See Rabiu v. INS, supra, at 883-84 (addressing ineffective assistance of counsel where the respondent’s counsel failed to file for relief from deportation); Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108, 110-11 (2d Cir. 1993) (addressing ineffective assistance of counsel where counsel failed to file an appeal). The Second Circuit views the breaches of an attorney’s obligation to his client that are at issue in these cases as violations implicating the fundamental fairness of the proceedings.
 
**12 In this case, we have evidence not only that the respondent’s counsel let him down by failing to represent him at the hearing on the merits of the removal charges and by failing to take an appeal to the Board, but also that the respondent has complied with our screening standard in Matter of Lozada, supra. In any event, even if the respondent is required to demonstrate prejudice, it appears that he has been harmed by his former counsel’s conduct or nonfeasance. He lost not only his opportunity to present his defenses and challenges to the charge of deportability, but also the opportunity to argue his legal position on appeal before the Board. See Rabiu v. INS, supra, at 883-84.
 
B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel as an Exceptional Situation
The majority bemoans the fact that the respondent raised these points *1229 in the context of an untimely motion to reopen and scolds the respondent for failing even to mention the untimeliness of his motion. But for this unfortunate factor, the majority suggests that it would consider reopening and remanding the case. The majority contends that its point of view is changed by the fact that the respondent delayed in bringing his motion. I must reject such reasoning.
 
To prevail on a motion to reopen that is untimely, the respondent must demonstrate that his case is one which presents an exceptional situation. Matter of J-J-, supra. The respondent has established aspects of his case that clearly compromised its fairness and resulted in his having to resort to this untimely motion. There is no evidence that the respondent’s motion is either dilatory or frivolous. To the contrary, it is compelling.
 
The exceptional situation presented by the respondent is one in which he was unrepresented below. Initially, he was afforded an opportunity to obtain counsel, but then was virtually denied the right to be represented when the Immigration Judge proceeded without even inquiring whether he had counsel. Secondly, he became the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel at his removal hearing and on appeal, when the attorney his family had retained failed to appear and represent him.
 
C. Gross Miscarriage of Justice as an Exceptional Situation
In addition, the exceptional situation presented involves a matter of substantive law. The respondent has alleged and argued, complete with legal citation, that, based on the record, he is not removable as charged. Specifically, he has pointed to the Service’s reliance on a charge that conflicts with the actual record of conviction in the record before us.
 
He also has argued that the statute under which he was convicted is a divisible one that, standing alone, cannot support the allegations made by the Service. See, e.g., Matter of Paulus, supra. He has shown that, according to the statutory burden assigned to the Service in a removal proceeding involving a lawful permanent resident, he is not subject to removal on the ground of deportability charged by the Service. Section 240(c)(3)(A) of the Act; see also Matter of Sweetser, Interim Decision 3390 (BIA 1999) (involving analysis of a divisible statute alleged to include a crime that constitutes an aggravated felony).
 
**13 As we made clear in Matter of Mena, supra, and Matter of Paulus, supra, a state controlled substance violation must be for a substance that is included in the federal controlled substance schedules to incur removal consequences. On its face, the state statute under which the respondent was convicted refers to “any controlled substance which is a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, or a narcotic substance.” Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 21a-277(a) (West 1995). The state statute therefore covers both the broader category of controlled substance offenses and the *1230 specific subcategory of narcotics offenses. +
+ We also have made clear that where a criminal statute includes some offenses that constitute the type of crime included in the immigration provision at issue, and some that do not, we look at the record of conviction to determine the precise nature of the offense of which the respondent was convicted. See Matter of Short, 20 I&N Dec. 136 (BIA 1989), and cases cited therein. Here, the record of conviction presented by the Service does not establish that the substance that gave rise to the respondent’s conviction is one, such as narcotics, which appears on the federal schedules as well as on the Connecticut schedules. See Matter of Davis, supra. In fact, the record of conviction states only that the conviction is for “Poss. with intent to sell” and makes no reference to any type of substance. This is inadequate to sustain the finding that the respondent has been convicted of an offense that qualifies as a controlled substance violation under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act.
 
Nevertheless, the Service persists in claiming that the record of conviction “specifically refers to possession with intent to sell •narcotics.”’ The fallacy of the Service’s argument is exposed by documentation and legal argument submitted by the respondent in support of his motion to reopen and request for a stay of removal. Through current counsel, he explains that the additional listings in the Connecticut statute would be rendered surplusage if the more narrow federal listing always trumped the state listing, as the Service urges it does. He emphasizes that, in fact, Connecticut law provides that federal law is deemed to control, except where the state has placed a particular substance not present on the federal schedule in a higher category on the Connecticut list. As an example, he points to the 1989 and 1990 additions to the Connecticut schedules of anabolic steroids and the legislative history related to such enactments, which clearly refers to Connecticut’s discretion to expand the state schedule beyond that provided in the federal schedules.
 
The majority is simply wrong in insisting that the respondent has not claimed that he is not removable, when the respondent has challenged the evidence submitted and the position taken by the Service in these proceedings. The majority is equally wrong in insisting that the respondent must assume the burden of proving that he is not deportable as charged by establishing the substance that formed the basis of his conviction.
 
**14 I do not read the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(a), enabling the Board to reopen or reconsider at any time on its own motion, to obviate the Service’s burden in the proceedings below to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is actually removable as charged. It would be unreasonable to so hold. Proving that he is not deportable is not the respondent’s burden in the context of an untimely motion to reopen; his burden is to establish an exceptional situation. See, e.g., Shahandeh-Pey v. INS, 831 F.2d 1384 (7th Cir. 1987) (finding no requirement that the respondent provide *1231 proof that his claim would have succeeded on the merits so long as the violation he suffered had the potential to affect the outcome of the hearing).
 
I conclude that an exercise of the Board’s discretion to reopen in an exceptional situation is warranted in the respondent’s case. The respondent’s removal based on such a defective record, in which the respondent has not been shown to be removable as charged, would constitute a gross miscarriage of justice, and our assertion of jurisdiction over his untimely motion to reopen is warranted.
 
III. AVAILABILITY OF RELIEF UNDER SECTION 212(c) OF THE ACT
On the record before us, there is every reason to believe that the Service has not met and cannot meet its burden of proving that the respondent is removable as charged based on clear and convincing evidence. On the basis of the conflict between the respondent’s admission and the record of conviction alone, I would, at a minimum, remand the case to the Immigration Judge so that the respondent could face the charges against him represented by counsel. However, I also find another reason to remand.
 
Even assuming that the respondent was convicted of a controlled substance violation that constitutes drug trafficking within the meaning of section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, that conviction occurred in 1995, not 1996. The record of conviction makes clear that the guilty plea was entered and guilt was found on October 24, 1995, before the enactment of section 440(d) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, 1277 (“AEDPA”). Only the sentencing took place on July 8, 1996.
 
I recognize that, arguably, the Attorney General’s decision in Matter of Soriano, 21 I&N Dec. 516 (BIA 1996; A.G. 1997), controls the question of the respondent’s eligibility to apply for a waiver under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1994). However, while I am bound by the rules pronounced by the Attorney General, I believe the recent opinions of the Supreme Court, as well as the decisions of the First, Second, Third, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuit Courts of Appeals and a growing number of federal district courts, rejecting the Attorney General’s decision in Matter of Soriano, warrant reconsideration of the Attorney General’s interpretation of the temporal reach of former section 212(c) of the Act, as amended. See also Matter of Truong, Interim Decision 3416 (Schmidt, dissenting).
 
**15 In essence, as interpreted by the Attorney General, the 1996 amendments deny an otherwise eligible permanent resident alien the opportunity he would have had before April 24, 1996, to apply for a discretionary waiver of deportability arising from a conviction for an offense classified as an *1232 aggravated felony. Cf. Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994). This interpretation of section 440(d) of the AEDPA raises significant issues that involve both principles of statutory interpretation generally and the presumption against the retroactive application of statutes specifically. See Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320 (1997); Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 520 U.S. 939 (1997); Landgraf v. USI Film Products, supra.
 
The Supreme Court construed Congress’ silence in the statutory section of AEDPA in question in Lindh as “indicating implicitly that the amendments (under consideration) were assumed and meant to apply . . . only when those cases had been filed after the date of the Act.” Lindh v. Murphy, supra, at 327 (emphasis added). As compared to amended sections of the statute in which Congress expressly provided for a retroactive application, the Court concluded that “(n)othing, indeed, but a different intent explains the different treatment.” Id. at 329; see also INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, supra, at 432 (“•”(W)here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion. “‘” (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo, 427 U.S. 720, 722 (5th Cir. 1972)))). This construction is equally applicable to the amendment to former section 212(c) of the Act, in light of the fact that Congress made expressly retroactive designations with regard to some provisions that modified the Act, but did not do so with regard to the amendment to former section 212(c) of the Act.
 
Although the respondent’s hearing took place after April 24, 1996, and although it was a removal hearing rather than a deportation hearing, I believe that the respondent may be entitled to have an opportunity to apply for a waiver of deportation under former section 212(c) of the Act. See Henderson v. INS, 157 F.3d 106, 129 (2d Cir. 1998) (holding that the amended statute has an impermissibly retroactive effect on pre-April 24, 1996, cases that already had been “initiated before the date of (the AEDPA’s) enactment”), cert. denied sub nom. Reno v. Navas, 119 S. Ct. 1141 (1999); see also Mojica v. Reno, 970 F. Supp. 130, 168-72 (E.D.N.Y. 1997). The recent rulings of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut in Dunbar v. INS, 64 F. Supp. 2d 47 (D. Conn. 1999), and the federal district court decisions in Pottinger v. Reno, 51 F. Supp. 2d 349 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), and Maria v. McElroy, No. 98 CV 6596 (JBW), 1999 WL 82582 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, 1999), support such a conclusion.
 
**16 Specifically, in Pottinger v. Reno, supra, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York followed the Second Circuit’s reasoning in Henderson and concluded that section 440(d) of the AEDPA did not apply to either the date that deportation proceedings were commenced or the date of the conviction forming the basis for deportability. *1233 Instead, the court reasoned that the operative event was the commission of the crime. Similarly, in Maria v. McElroy, supra, a companion case to Pottinger, the Eastern District of New York reiterated its holding that section 440(d) does not apply to criminal conduct completed before the enactment of the AEDPA. Applying the Henderson and Mojica reasoning, as well as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, G.A. Res. 2200 (XXI), 21 U.N. GAOR, Supp. No. 16, at 52, U.N. Doc. A/6316 (1967) (entered into force Mar. 23, 1976; entered into force for the United States Sept. 8, 1992), the court reasoned that it was impermissible to apply section 440(d) of the AEDPA to offenses committed before its enactment.
 
The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, which would have habeas corpus jurisdiction over the respondent’s case were he to seek review of our decision, has adopted this reasoning and applied it to an alien in removal proceedings whose commission of a crime occurred prior to the AEDPA’s enactment. The court found that the commission of the crime was “the operative event” and reasoned that relief under former section 212(c) “constitutes a legal interest that is important enough for retrospective applications concerns to apply.” Dunbar v. INS, supra, at 53-54 (citing Pottinger v. Reno, supra, at 362). The court went on to note that “the very purpose of the amendments was to change the legal consequences of certain criminal conduct, not the consequences of being convicted of that conduct or having deportation proceedings commenced.” Dunbar v. INS, supra, at 54.
 
We need not even go as far back as the date on which the respondent committed the offense. Only recently, the Ninth Circuit recognized specifically that the alteration of the law certainly would “severely disturb (a respondent’s) settled expectations (at the time he pled guilty),” that he could apply for a waiver. Magana-Pizano v. INS, 1999 WL 1249703, at *8 (9th Cir. Dec. 27, 1999) (concluding that the amended version of section 212(c) of the Act may not apply if a respondent relied on access to a waiver in entering a plea of guilty). Thus, a showing of detrimental reliance on access to a waiver under section 212(c) of the Act would make the application of the amended statute retroactive as to such a respondent. Id.; see also Wallace v. Reno, 24 F. Supp. 2d 104, 110-11 (D. Mass. 1998), aff’d, 194 F.3d 279 (1st Cir. 1999).
 
The fact that the respondent is in a removal proceeding where the statute no longer provides for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Act, rather than a deportation proceeding under the former version of the statute, does not necessarily extinguish the respondent’s vested interest in applying for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Act. Nothing in section 304(b) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-597 (“IIRIRA”), repealing former section 212(c) of the Act states that such a repeal is to operate retroactively. See also IIRIRA § 309(a), 110 Stat. at 3009-625 (providing that the provisions of Title III-A, of which section 304(b) is part, apply beginning April 1, 1997); cf. IIRIRA § 309(c)(1), 110 Stat. at 3009-625 *1234 (providing that in the case of an alien who “is in” deportation or exclusion proceedings as of the Title III-A effective date (April 1, 1997), “ the amendments made by this subtitle shall not apply”).
 
**17 Congress did not expressly state that there would be no continuing jurisdiction over a respondent’s application for a section 212(c) waiver when the respondent is determined to have a vested interest in an opportunity to apply for such relief. Its reformation of vested interests that lodged prior to the effective date of the statute can be accomplished by repeal only if Congress expressly states its intent to achieve such a result. See Rodrock v. Security Indus. Bank, 642 F.2d 1193, 1196 (10th Cir. 1981).
 
Consequently, although an agency’s jurisdiction may be lost by the repeal of the statute that granted it, if vested rights have been acquired under the former law, jurisdiction is retained unless Congress dictates otherwise. See Pentheny v. Government of the Virgin Islands, 360 F.2d 786, 790 (3d Cir. 1966); see also Steamship Co. v. Joliffe, 69 U.S. 450, 458 (1864) (holding that repeal and reenactment “may, therefore, more properly be said to be substituted in the place of, and to continue in force with modifications, the provisions of the original act, rather than to have abrogated and annulled them”).
 
Thus, neither the amendment nor the repeal of former section 212(c) of the Act would have any meaningful bearing on the respondent’s reasonable expectation at the time he entered a guilty plea and was convicted of the offense in 1995 that he would have the opportunity to apply for a waiver under section 212(c) as it existed. Imposing such a limitation appears contrary to the thrust of the Landgraf, Hughes, and Lindh cases decided by the Supreme Court. Accordingly, reexamination of our interpretation of the statute may be appropriate, and the conclusion that the respondent can seek a waiver under former section 212(c) may be warranted. See Matter of Truong, supra (Schmidt, dissenting).
 
IV. CONCLUSION
The respondent faced a removal hearing before the Immigration Judge without an attorney and was questioned without the advice of counsel. His answers to seemingly straightforward, but actually highly technical, questions are not adequate to meet the Service’s burden of proving a lawful permanent resident removable.
 
Because the respondent was denied representation by competent counsel, the allegations and charges levied by the Service were neither scrutinized nor challenged. The inconsistencies between the allegations lodged by the Service and the documentary evidence submitted by the Service *1235 were not raised or satisfactorily resolved. These inadequacies also were not addressed in the respondent’s appeal of right to the Board, and, as a result, this former Marine and father of two who has lived in the United States for 27 years faces a final order of removal.
 
I do not believe this to be a reasonable or a just result. Consequently, I dissent and would grant the respondent’s motion to reopen the proceedings.

for respondent
Frederick A. Organ, Esquire
River Vale, New Jersey
Before: Board En Banc: SCHMIDT, Chairman; DUNNE, Vice Chairman; SCIALABBA, Vice Chairman; VACCA, HOLMES, HURWITZ, VILLAGELIU, FILPPU, COLE, ROSENBERG, MATHON, GUENDELSBERGER, JONES, GRANT, MOSCATO, and MILLER, Board Members.
 
MATHON, Board Member:
 
In an order dated October 27, 1997, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen deportation proceedings, which were conducted in absentia in 1991 pursuant to section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b) (1988). The respondent filed a timely appeal from the Immigration Judge’s order, supported by an appellate brief. The Immigration and Naturalization Service did not file a brief in opposition to the appeal. For the following reasons, we will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
  
*1156 I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
 
The record reveals that on September 13, 1990, the respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, entered the United States without inspection. On September 15, 1990, the respondent was personally served with an Order to Show Cause, Notice of Hearing, and Warrant for Arrest of Alien (Form I-221S). On December 3, 1990, the Immigration Court sent notice of a hearing to the respondent’s address of record, informing her of a deportation hearing scheduled for April 9, 1991. When the respondent failed to appear for her scheduled hearing, the Immigration Judge found her deportable as charged and ordered that she be deported from the United States pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act.1 On July 16, 1997, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings, claiming that she was eligible to adjust her status to that of a permanent resident owing to an approved visa petition filed on her behalf by her United States citizen husband. The respondent did not provide a reason for her absence from her 1991 deportation hearing.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely filed on October 27, 1997. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent failed to demonstrate that she did not receive notice of the hearing, that her failure to appear was because of “exceptional circumstances,” or that she was in federal or state custody at the time of the hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii) (1998).
 
**2 The respondent contends in her Notice of Appeal that she missed her scheduled hearing because her former attorney had been “suspended by the Bar” at the time he appeared on her behalf and that he did not effectively represent her. The respondent’s appellate brief offers no support for this contention and does not further explain how her attorney’s actions may have caused her to miss her hearing. Instead, the respondent’s appellate *1157 brief asserts that these proceedings should be reopened to allow the respondent to adjust her status based on the approved visa petition filed on her behalf by her United States citizen husband.
  
II. ISSUES PRESENTED
 
The issues in this case are: (1) whether the regulatory language at 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii) contains time or numerical limitations on an alien who wishes to file a motion to reopen to vacate an outstanding order of deportation entered in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act; (2) whether the “exceptional circumstances” standard set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(1) is properly applied to motions seeking to reopen deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act in order to vacate the underlying order; and (3) whether proceedings should be reopened to allow the respondent to pursue her request for new, previously unavailable relief in the form of adjustment of status.
  
III. ANALYSIS
 
We find that the regulatory language at 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii) imposes no time or numerical limitations on an alien who wishes to file a motion to reopen to vacate an underlying order of deportation entered pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act. We recently reached the same result in the context of exclusion proceedings. See Matter of N-B-, Interim Decision 3381 (BIA 1999).
 
As we observed in Matter of N-B-, supra, federal regulations govern time and numerical limitations on motions to reopen removal, deportation, and exclusion proceedings. The regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(1) provides generally that “(a) motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal, deportation, or exclusion, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later.” See also 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(c)(2) (1999) (regarding motions to reopen or reconsider filed with the Board). Furthermore, 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(1) states that, with certain exceptions, “a party may file only one motion to reconsider and one motion to reopen proceedings.” One such exception exists for a motion to reopen in the asylum context based on changed country conditions. 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(i); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Additionally, no time and numerical limitations apply to a motion to reopen that is agreed upon by all parties and jointly filed. 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iv).
 
The regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii)(A) contains a different time frame for motions seeking to reopen deportation proceedings that were conducted in absentia. See 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii)(D). The regulation first *1158 permits an alien to file such a motion to reopen within 180 days of the in absentia deportation order if the alien demonstrates “exceptional circumstances” for failing to appear. 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(1). The regulation also allows an alien to file a motion at any time if the alien demonstrates that proper notice was not given or that he or she was in federal or state custody and the failure to appear was not the alien’s fault. 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(2). In Matter of Mancera, Interim Decision 3353 (BIA 1998), we discussed this regulation and found that the alien, who had been ordered deported in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act, had proved a lack of proper notice. We therefore found that the alien’s motion to reopen was excepted from the regulatory time limitations on motions. Id.
 
**3 Guided in part by our holding in Matter of N-B-, supra, we find in the instant case that the applicable regulations contain a gap that does not provide an explicit time and numerical exception for motions to reopen deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act.2 We find that the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(1) applies only to deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b (Supp. II 1990). As previously noted, Congress added section 242B to the Act via the Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978 (“1990 Act”). The regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(1) mirrors the statutory language of section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act, which sets a 180-day time limitation on certain motions to reopen deportation proceedings conducted in absentia. The statutory language found in section 242(b) of the Act contains no time or numerical limitation for motions to reopen proceedings conducted in absentia. Additionally, the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(1) applies the “exceptional circumstances” standard for reopening found in section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act instead of the “reasonable cause” standard in section 242(b) of the Act.
 
It appears that the drafters of 8 C.F.R. § 3.23 focused on updating the regulation to conform to the applicable changes in the law made by the 1990 Act, which added section 242B to the Act. See Motions and Appeals in Immigration Proceedings, 61 Fed. Reg. 18,900, 18,903 (1996). The *1159 Supplementary Information introducing the amendments to the regulation discusses, among other legal issues, motions to reopen and direct appeals in the context of deportation proceedings under section 242B of the Act, as well as exclusion proceedings under section 236 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1226 (1994). However, the Supplementary Information does not implicitly or explicitly discuss motions to reopen proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act.
 
Construing the existing regulatory language, we find that the motions regulations set no time or numerical limitations on aliens seeking to reopen deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act for the purpose of vacating the underlying order of deportation.3 See Matter of N-B-, supra, at 4-5. We reaffirm our holding in Matter of Mancera, supra, insofar as we held that a motion to reopen deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act that demonstrates a lack of notice is excepted from the regulatory time limitations on motions to reopen. Furthermore, we find that when aliens are seeking to reopen deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act in order to vacate the outstanding deportation order, it is appropriate to apply the “reasonable cause” standard, not the “exceptional circumstances” standard set forth in section 242B of the Act. See Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547 (BIA 1992); Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 1985), aff’d, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986); Matter of Marallag, 13 I&N Dec. 775 (BIA 1971).
 
**4 In the instant case, the Immigration Judge erroneously applied the “exceptional circumstances” standard to the respondent’s case. The respondent, whose deportation hearing was not governed by section 242B of the Act, need only have shown that she had “reasonable cause” for missing her scheduled deportation hearing. Nonetheless, the respondent’s motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge failed to assert any “reasonable cause” for her failure to appear. On appeal, the respondent argues for the first time that she was represented at her hearing by an attorney who was suspended and who did not effectively represent her. Even if we were to consider this argument--advanced for the first time on appeal--we must reject it, as the respondent has not complied with the requirements for proving ineffective assistance that were set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). We note that the respondent has not *1160 alleged that she failed to receive proper notice of her hearing. See Matter of Munoz-Santos, 20 I&N Dec. 205 (BIA 1990) (discussing notice under section 242(b) of the Act); Matter of Lopez-Barrios, 20 I&N Dec. 203 (BIA 1990) (same). In light of the foregoing, we find that the respondent has not shown that reopening should be allowed for the purpose of vacating the underlying order of deportation, which was entered in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act.
 
Alternatively, the respondent continues to request reopening of these proceedings to apply for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255 (1994). In Matter of M-S-, Interim Decision 3369 (BIA 1998), we held that deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242B of the Act may be reopened to allow an alien to apply for new, previously unavailable relief if the alien’s motion to reopen is filed according to the regulatory requirements at 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.2(c) and 3.23(b)(3). We need not decide in the instant case whether to extend our holding in Matter of M-S- to these deportation proceedings, which were conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act. Insofar as the respondent’s motion to reopen requested an adjudication of her application for adjustment of status, the motion was untimely because it was not filed by September 30, 1996. See 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(1); see also Matter of M-S-, supra (discussing the regulatory requirements for filing a motion requesting new relief).
  
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly, we conclude that the respondent’s motion to reopen to vacate the outstanding order of deportation entered in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act was not barred by the regulatory time or numerical limitations. However, the respondent did not establish that “reasonable cause” or a lack of notice excused her absence from the scheduled hearing. Insofar as the respondent’s motion requested reopening to apply for new relief, the motion was not timely filed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
**5 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Prior to June 13, 1992, section 242(b) of the Act governed all deportation proceedings. See Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, 506 n.2 (BIA 1996). Deportation proceedings involving notices of hearing issued between June 13, 1992, and March 31, 1997, were governed by section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b (Supp. II 1990), which was added by Congress in the Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, § 545(a), 104 Stat. 4978, 5061-66 (“1990 Act”), and was amended by the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991, Pub. L.

The law governing motions to reopen exclusion proceedings conducted in absentia traditionally has corresponded with the law governing motions to reopen deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act. For example, the Board, relying on the statutory language of section 242(b) of the Act (governing deportation proceedings), has required aliens filing such motions in either type of proceeding to show that “reasonable cause” excused their absence from a scheduled hearing. See Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992) (deportation proceedings conducted pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act); Matter of Ruiz, 20 I&N Dec. 91, 92-93 (BIA 1989) (exclusion proceedings).

We emphasize that our decision in the instant case fills in the regulatory gap that exists in the current regulation. Nothing prevents the Department of Justice from revising the current regulation to fill the regulatory gap in a manner that would create specific restrictions on motions to reopen deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act. See Matter of N-B-, supra, at 5 n.2.

VILLAGELIU, Board Member:
 
In a decision dated August 8, 1997, the Immigration Judge found the respondent deportable as charged under section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) (1994), denied his motion to terminate proceedings, and ordered that he be deported to Nigeria. The respondent has appealed. The appeal will be dismissed. The respondent’s motion to remand will be denied.1 The request for oral argument before the Board is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 3.1(e) (1998).
  
*553 I. SUMMARY OF FACTS
 
The respondent entered the United States on June 14, 1986, as a nonimmigrant visitor. On January 20, 1993, the respondent’s status was adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident alien. On September 20, 1995, the respondent was convicted pursuant to his plea of guilty in the Superior Court of Hamilton County, Indiana, of the offense of submitting a false claim with intent to defraud the Indiana Farmers Mutual Insurance Company, in violation of section 35-43-5-4(10) of the Indiana Code. The offense is a Class D felony for which the respondent received the maximum penalty of 3 years’ confinement.
 
The offense arose out of a “slip and fall” in an Indiana convenience store on February 2, 1993, after which the respondent submitted a false medical bill to the insurance company in support of his claim. The respondent initially sought $60,000 from the insurance company, but agreed to settle for $15,000. He was arrested by law enforcement officers posing as insurance company employees when he arrived at a meeting to sign a release and collect the $15,000. Following his conviction, the respondent was charged on December 27, 1996, with deportability under section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, as an aggravated felon. The Order To Show Cause and Notice of Hearing (Form I-221) specifies that the respondent was convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43) (1994 & Supp. II 1996), “to wit: an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss or potential loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.” At the deportation hearing, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was deportable as an aggravated felon under sections 101(a)(43)(M)(i) and (U) of the Act.
  
II. ISSUES
 
**2 On appeal, the respondent contends that his conviction is not for an aggravated felony, as defined under either section 101(a)(43)(M)(i) or (U) of the Act because the insurance company did not suffer a loss in excess of $10,000. He also contends that his conviction is not final because an appeal is pending.
  
III. ANALYSIS
 
Section 101(a)(43)(M)(i) of the Act provides that the term “aggravated felony” includes an offense that “involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.” Section 101(a)(43)(U) of the Act provides that the term “aggravated felony” also includes “an attempt or *554 conspiracy to commit an offense described in (section 101(a)(43)).”
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is deportable as an aggravated felon because he was convicted of an offense involving an attempt to defraud $15,000 from the insurance company.2 We find that under the Indiana statute in question an attempt to defraud is included within the offense of which the respondent was convicted. The statute under which the respondent was convicted provides that “a person who knowingly and with intent to defraud, makes, utters, presents, or causes to be presented to an insurer, a claim statement that contains false, incomplete, or misleading information concerning the claim . . . commits fraud, a Class D Felony.” Ind. Code Ann. § 35-43-5-4(10) (West 1995) (see Appendix A). The Indiana statute does not require proof that the insurer incurred a loss. It encompasses both successful frauds and unsuccessful attempts to defraud an insurance company.
 
Where a criminal charge of attempted fraud is alleged under Indiana law, the State need only prove that a substantial step toward the commission of the fraud occurred, along with the requisite intent to defraud. Houston v. State, 528 N.E.2d 818 (Ind. Ct. App. 1988). The record of conviction reflects that the respondent had initiated the paperwork necessary to complete the fraud and was arrested after he arrived at a meeting to collect the $15,000. Like the defendant in Houston v. State, supra, the respondent in this case had not completed the transaction required to obtain the proceeds of his crime when he was arrested while trying to flee from the undercover police officers. The Indiana court in Houston v. State, supra, ruled that the substantial step of presenting a stolen credit card belonging to someone else for payment of a watch was a sufficient substantial step to support a conviction for attempted fraud even though the defendant did not actually sign the credit card charge slip or receive the watch when the store security officer took possession of the credit card as stolen.
 
We disagree with the respondent’s contention that section 101(a)(43)(U) of the Act requires that the victim suffer an actual loss which exceeds $10,000. By its very nature, an attempt involves an unsuccessful effort to commit a crime. Wayne R. LaFave et al., Criminal Law § 6.2 (2d ed. 1986). Here, the offense for which the respondent was convicted involved an attempt to obtain $15,000 from the insurance company through fraud and deceit. The respondent’s actions support a conviction for attempted fraud which is a lesser included offense within a conviction for fraud under Indiana law. Houston v. State, supra. The fact that the respondent failed to obtain the money is of no consequence under section 101(a)(43)(U) of the Act, which prescribes deportability as an aggravated felon for aliens convicted of an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense described in section 101(a)(43) of the Act. In view of this conclusion we need not address at this time the Immigration Judge’s additional finding that the respondent is also deportable as an aggravated  *555 felon under section 101(a)(43)(M)(i), as an alien convicted of a fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim exceeds $10,000.
 
**3 With regard to the respondent’s contention that his conviction is not final, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the conviction is final. The respondent was convicted upon his plea of guilty on September 20, 1995, and has no right of direct appeal from his guilty plea under Indiana law. Tumulty v. State, 666 N.E.2d 394 (Ind. 1996); Weyls v. State, 362 N.E.2d 481 (Ind. 1977). Instead, he may only seek relief under Indiana Post-Conviction Rule PC 1. On December 6, 1996, the respondent submitted a late appeal from his conviction, along with other motions, claiming that the trial court lacked jurisdiction, and thus, his conviction was not yet final. However, we note that on January 17, 1997, the clerk’s office for Hamilton County, Indiana, referred to all these filings as part of the respondent’s April 15, 1996, Petition for Post-Conviction Relief. The deadline for appealing criminal convictions in Indiana is 30 days, and upon expiration of the filing period, a defendant waives his right for direct appeal under Indiana Criminal Rule 11. Clark v. State, 506 N.E. 2d 810 (Ind. 1987).
 
The availability of post-conviction motions or other forms of collateral attack does not affect the finality of criminal conviction for immigration purposes, unless and until the conviction has been overturned pursuant to such a motion. Okabe v. INS, 671 F.2d 863 (5th Cir. 1982). We therefore conclude that the respondent’s conviction is final, regardless of any impact that new section 101(a)(48) may have on the notion of “finality” as it evolved before enactment of a definition of “conviction.” See Matter of Chairez, Interim Decision 3248 (BIA 1995); Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894 (BIA 1994).
 
Finally, in the respondent’s motion, he raises the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, he has failed to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We also find the respondent’s constitutional arguments to be without merit. See Matter of Fuentes-Campos, Interim Decision 3318 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
  
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Upon consideration, therefore, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is deportable on account of his conviction for an aggravated felony. Furthermore, the respondent has not complied with the requirements for showing that he was denied the effective *556 assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed and the motion denied.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion is denied.

**4 DISSENTING OPINION: Michael J. Heilman, Board Member, in which Paul W. Schmidt, Chairman; Mary Maguire Dunne, Vice Chairman; John W. Guendelsberger and Lory D. Rosenberg, Board Members, joined
I respectfully dissent.
 
In its decision, the majority finds that the respondent’s conviction for a completed fraud under Indiana law is an “attempt” falling within the parameters of section 101(a)(43)(U) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(U) (Supp. II 1996). The respondent was entitled to notice of that charge of deportability so that he could defend against it. However, he did not receive notice of the charge upon which the majority has found him deportable. Moreover, the respondent’s conviction under Indiana law was for a completed fraud--not an “attempt” as set forth under section 101(a)(43)(U) of the Act. Accordingly, I would sustain the respondent’s appeal.
 
The respondent was not charged with deportability under section 101(a)(43)(U) of the Act. He was charged in the Order To Show Cause and Notice of Hearing (Form I-221) (“OSC”) as follows:
Section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), as amended, in that, at any time after entry, you have been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43) of the Act, to wit: an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss or potential loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.
 
 
The plain wording of the OSC does not describe a conviction for “attempt” or make reference to section 101(a)(43)(U) of the Act. Instead, the wording is similar to the language set forth in section 101(a)(43)(M)(i), which provides that the term “aggravated felony” includes any offense that “involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.” Given the plain wording of the OSC and its similarity to the language set forth in section 101(a)(43)(M)(i), the respondent filed a motion to terminate the deportation proceedings, in part on the basis that the victim of his fraud had not suffered any monetary loss, much less a financial loss in an amount exceeding $10,000. His motion clearly demonstrates that he was not given adequate notice of the precise charge of deportability against him. The Immigration Judge also recognized that the language in the OSC raised an issue with regard to the adequacy of the notice to the respondent of the *557 precise charge of deportability set forth in the OSC. However, in her written order on the motion to terminate, the Immigration Judge concluded that the use of the term “potential” in the OSC charge was sufficient to give the respondent notice of the “specific charge of deportability.” The Immigration Judge cites no legal precedent for her conclusion. I cannot agree that insertion of the word “potential” in the OSC charge gives the respondent notice that he has been charged with an attempt under section 101(a)(43)(U) of the Act.
 
An alien is entitled to notice of the nature of the charge against him. Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, 344 U.S. 590, 596-98 (1953). The OSC neglects to state that the charge upon which the respondent is deportable is an attempt under section 101(a)(43)(U) of the Act. In this respect, the OSC fails to satisfy the requirement that the OSC inform the respondent of the “designation of the charge against the respondent and the statutory provisions alleged to have been violated.” See 8 C.F.R. § 242.1(b) (1997). Therefore, I conclude that the respondent in this case was not given adequate notice of the charge of deportability against him. See Matter of Siffre, 14 I&N Dec. 444 (BIA 1973) (stating that an alien is entitled to know the correct ground upon which his deportation is being sought); see also Matter of Liburd, 15 I&N Dec. 769 (BIA 1976) (same). Accordingly, I would sustain the appeal.
 
**5 I also disagree with the majority’s conclusion that the offense for which the respondent was convicted is an “attempt” falling within the parameters of section 101(a)(43)(U) of the Act. The inclusion of subparagraph (U) in section 101(a)(43), which lists offenses that are deemed to constitute aggravated felonies, must be read in conjunction with section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) (1994), which plainly requires a conviction for any designated offense relied upon to establish deportability. Thus, to come within the statutory language regarding an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense described in this paragraph, a respondent must have been convicted of either attempt or conspiracy, and the attempt or conspiracy of which a respondent was convicted must be for an offense included under the other subsections of section 101(a)(43) of the Act. Under section 35-43-5-4(10) of the Indiana Code, the offense of fraud against an insurer is complete when an individual knowingly presents a claim containing false information to the insurer. The statute does not require proof that the insurer suffer a loss in order to obtain a conviction. The respondent’s contention on appeal that he is not deportable as charged for an aggravated felony based on section 101(a)(43)(M)(i) of the Act is correct. The record of conviction reflects that no loss was suffered in connection with the offense of which the respondent was convicted.
 
The majority, however, now takes the respondent’s conviction for a completed fraud under the Indiana statute and concludes that “(t)he respondent’s actions support a conviction for attempted fraud which is a lesser *558 included offense within a conviction for fraud under Indiana law.” Matter of Onyido, Interim Decision 3379, at 4 (BIA 1999). That may well be true, but it is completely irrelevant. The respondent was convicted of the completed fraud--not an attempted fraud. It is not for us to look behind the conviction, review the facts underlying the conviction, and conclude that the respondent might have been convicted of some other lesser included offense, such as an attempt or a conspiracy to commit the substantive offense underlying the attempt or conspiracy. We have always found that the crimes of attempt and conspiracy, as used in the Immigration and Nationality Act, referred only to convictions for attempt and conspiracy--not to crimes of which the respondent might have been convicted. See, e.g., Matter of Davis, 20 I&N Dec. 536 (BIA 1992) (conviction for conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance); Matter of J-, 4 I&N Dec. 512 (BIA 1951) (conviction for attempt to escape); Matter of V-, 4 I&N Dec. 100 (BIA 1950) (conviction for attempted bribery).
 
The majority appears to recognize that the respondent was not convicted of an “attempt” and seeks to sweep that critical fact away by finding that “under the Indiana statute in question an attempt to defraud is included within the offense of which the respondent was convicted.” Matter of Onyido, supra, at 3. That is simply incorrect. Section 35-41-5-1 of the Indiana Code is the general attempt statute in Indiana. Section 35-43-5-4(10) of the Indiana Code, the fraud statute under which the respondent was convicted, does not include any lesser offense of attempted fraud. Indeed, the very case upon which the majority relies so heavily, Houston v. State, 528 N.E.2d 818 (Ind. Ct. App. 1988), is a case involving a conviction under section 35-41-5-1 of the Indiana Code, the general attempt statute, for the offense of attempted credit card fraud. The defendant in Houston was not convicted of the completed offense of fraud, as was the respondent in the instant case. Thus, the case upon which the majority so heavily relies establishes the very point that is so crucial in this case--that the respondent was not convicted of an “attempt.”

ROSENBERG, Board Member:
 
The respondents have appealed the decision of the Immigration Judge not to reopen proceedings in which they were granted voluntary departure.1 The appeal will be dismissed. The request for oral argument is denied.
 
The respondents, natives and citizens of Iran, entered the United States on nonimmigrant visitor visas on different dates in 1990. On October 1, 1996, the respondents were granted voluntary departure until June 15, 1997. On June 19, 1997, after their period of voluntary departure had expired, the respondents filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, alleging that prior counsel wrongfully dissuaded them from applying for asylum and charging her with ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
On July 2, 1997, the Immigration Judge denied the respondents’ motion to reopen, observing that they had not complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in our decision Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, *310 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The Immigration Judge also commented that motions to reopen that serve dilatory purposes are disfavored and noted that the respondents were granted a generous period of voluntary departure for the express purpose of allowing a minor respondent to finish school.
 
On appeal, the respondents have submitted additional documentation in an effort to comply with the Lozada requirements and maintain that they have been the victims of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondents allege that former counsel wrongly advised them that corroborating evidence would be necessary for their asylum claim and thus precluded them from applying for that relief. The respondents also argue that their efforts to satisfy the requirements of Lozada, while not precisely in accordance with that decision, are sufficiently proximate to make their claim.
 
In reply, the Immigration and Naturalization Service endorses the decision of the Immigration Judge. Noting that both the respondents’ motion to reopen and their Notice of Appeal were untimely,2 the Service contends that the record reflects prior counsel’s best judgment and not a refusal to file an asylum application.
 
As a general matter, we are reticent to revisit the respondents’ choice of relief. First, there are strong policy reasons for strictly adhering to and enforcing voluntary departure orders, not the least of which is to discourage dilatory behavior. See Matter of Shaar, Interim Decision 3290 (BIA 1996), aff’d, 141 F.3d 953 (9th Cir. 1998). The timing of the respondents’ motion to reopen and their failure to take any remedial action during their 8½ months of voluntary departure period invites speculation into the motive behind the filing of their motion. Second, subsequent dissatisfaction with a strategic decision of counsel is not grounds to reopen. See Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931 (9th Cir. 1986) (finding that the decision to forego contesting deportability in favor of a generous grant of voluntary departure is a tactical choice); cf. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992) (stating that withdrawal of an asylum claim to secure a tactical advantage in the first hearing did not constitute a reasonable explanation for failing to pursue the claim at that hearing). The respondents opted for a particular strategy and form of relief, and although they might wish to fault their former attorney and recant that decision, they are nonetheless bound by it, unless they can show egregious conduct on counsel’s part. See Matter of Lozada, supra; see also LeBlanc v. INS, 715 F.2d 685 (1st Cir. 1983).
 
**2 Through their claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the *311 respondents seek to characterize the advice of former counsel as egregious conduct. They argue that “but for” her insistence on corroborating evidence, they would have pursued their asylum claim. Upon review of the record and the respondents’ contentions on appeal, we are not persuaded by this argument.
 
To prevail, the respondents must show that the conduct of former counsel was so egregious that it rendered their hearing unfair. See Matter of Lozada, supra. However, we observe no misconduct, malfeasance, or incompetence on counsel’s part. Cf. Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3284 (BIA 1996). To the contrary, the record reflects that counsel was professional in her handling of the respondents’ case and counseled them accordingly. We observe that counsel secured certain benefits for the respondents, including generous periods of voluntary departure from both the Service and the Immigration Court. She also explored other immigration options, including employment-based nonimmigrant visas, family-based immigrant visas, and--at least initially-- political asylum. On its face, the conduct of former counsel is not that which we envisioned in our decision in Lozada.
 
The respondents maintain that it was egregious conduct for counsel to insist on corroborating evidence before prosecuting their asylum claim. We find, however, that counsel’s evaluation of their asylum claim and her insistence on corroborating evidence was entirely reasonable. We are cognizant that, in some instances, an asylum-seeker need not have corroborating evidence to prevail. See Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 I&N Dec. 439 (BIA 1987). Nonetheless, the provision of corroborating evidence is not optional, and the respondents must satisfy their affirmative duty to corroborate their claim to the degree that they can, or otherwise reasonably explain their failure to do so. See Matter of S-M-J-, Interim Decision 3303 (BIA 1997); Matter of Dass, 20 I&N Dec. 120 (BIA 1989); see also Matter of M-D-, Interim Decision 3339 (BIA 1998); Matter of Y-B-, Interim Decision 3337 (BIA 1998). We find nothing egregious in counsel advising the respondents to comply with express legal precedent, particularly when counsel must balance her clients’ desire for relief with her duty to both the court and her clients’ interests not to file a frivolous application for relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 292.3(a)(15)(i) (1998); see also section 208(d)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(d)(6) (Supp. II 1996).
 
In summary, we find that the respondents have not made a prima facie showing of ineffective assistance of counsel. As the record does not establish that former counsel engaged in egregious conduct, we decline to reopen the proceedings. See Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Mohsseni Behbahani v. INS, 796 F.2d 249 (9th Cir. 1986). See generally Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 1984).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
Footnotes

1

The respondents’ timely appeal was initially rejected because it was not accompanied by a notice of appearance. To avoid any jurisdictional issues, we will consider this case on certification, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 3.1(c) (1998).

2

At the motion level, the Service argued that the respondents were time barred from filing their motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.2(c)(2), 3.23(b)(4)(i) (1997). The Immigration Judge did not address this objection in his ruling on the motion. As we find the respondents have not made a persuasive claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we do not reach this jurisdictional issue.

IN RE Guo Yu LEI, Respondent
File A42 733 363 - San Francisco
Decided July 16, 1998
**1 *113 A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day statutory limit for the filing of a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia order of deportation under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3)(A) (1994), on the basis of exceptional circumstances.

Before: Board En Banc: VACCA, HEILMAN, HOLMES, HURWITZ, FILPPU, COLE, MATHON, JONES, and GRANT, Board Members. Concurring and Dissenting Opinions: ROSENBERG, Board Member; GUENDELSBERGER, Board Member. Dissenting Opinions: SCHMIDT, Chairman; VILLAGELIU, Board Member.
 
MATHON, Board Member:
 
In a decision dated September 14, 1995, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent deported in absentia after he failed to appear for his scheduled hearing. On September 26, 1995, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, which was denied by the Immigration Judge. The Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision on April 30, 1996, and on September 30, 1996, the respondent filed this motion to reopen with the Board. The motion will be denied.
  
I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The record reflects that the respondent and his first attorney appeared *114 at a hearing before the Immigration Judge on January 31, 1995. He conceded deportability on the charge under section 241(a)(1)(D)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(D)(i) (1994), but denied the remaining charges against him. The continued hearing was originally set for October 10, 1995, and the respondent’s attorney was personally served with the notice of hearing in court. However, the hearing was later rescheduled for September 14, 1995. Notice of the rescheduled hearing was sent to the respondent’s attorney of record by certified mail, and the signed certified mail receipt is included in the record. However, neither the respondent nor his attorney appeared for the September 14, 1995, hearing, and the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent deported in absentia pursuant to section 242B(c)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c) (1994).
 
On September 26, 1995, the respondent, through the same attorney, filed a motion to reopen requesting rescission of the in absentia deportation order under section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Act, alleging that neither he nor his attorney received notice of the rescheduled hearing. On November 27, 1995, the Immigration Judge denied the motion after determining that sufficient notice had been provided to counsel in accordance with section 242B(a)(2) of the Act. See also 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a) (1995) (providing that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the alien). The respondent timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision, reiterating his lack of notice claim. On April 30, 1996, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal.1
 
**2 On September 30, 1996, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a motion to reopen with the Board. He now contends that his original failure to appear was due to “exceptional circumstances” under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act.2 The respondent concedes that the time limit for filing a motion seeking rescission of an in absentia deportation order on such a basis has expired. However, he contends that the time bar should not apply in this case, given the fact that the failure to timely file was due to the ineffective assistance of his former attorney. Specifically, he argues that due to his former attorney’s lack of familiarity with immigration law, she failed to recognize the potential “exceptional circumstances” claim within the statutory time limit for such motions.
  
*115 II. ISSUE PRESENTED
 
The issue before the Board is whether a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes an exception to the 180-day time limit under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act.
  
III. APPLICABLE LAW
 
Section 242B(c)(3) of the Act provides for the rescission of a deportation order entered in absentia under section 242B(c)(1) as follows:
RESCISSION OF ORDER. -- Such an order may be rescinded only --
(A) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (f)(2)), or
(B) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with subsection (a)(2) or the alien demonstrates that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien.
Section 242B(c)(3) of the Act.
 
The use of the term “only” makes this the exclusive method for rescinding an in absentia deportation order entered pursuant to section 242B(c) of the Act. See Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644, 646 (BIA 1993).
  
IV. ANALYSIS
 
Section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act expressly requires that a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances be filed within 180 days of the in absentia order. The record in this case reflects that the order of deportation was entered on September 14, 1995. The respondent did not file his current motion until September 30, 1996, well beyond the 180 days allotted by the statute. Therefore, we find that the respondent is statutorily barred from rescinding the deportation order under section 242B(c)(3)(A).3
 
The respondent concedes that the time limit for filing a motion to reopen to rescind based upon exceptional circumstances has elapsed. However, he essentially urges us to create an exception to the 180-day rule, *116 where the failure to timely file a motion to reopen is due to ineffective assistance of counsel. We decline to do so.
 
It is well settled that the language of the statute is the starting point of statutory construction. See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 431 (1987). The plain meaning of the words used in the statute as a whole has been held to be the paramount index of congressional intent. Id. at 431; Matter of W-F-, Interim Decision 3288, at 6 (BIA 1996). Moreover, it is assumed that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used. INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 189 (1984); see also Matter of Shaar, Interim Decision 3290 (BIA 1996), aff’d, 141 F.3d 953 (9th Cir. 1998).
 
**3 The language of section 242B(c)(3)(A) regarding the time limit within which a motion to reopen must be filed is clear on its face and unambiguous. It provides that an in absentia deportation order entered pursuant to section 242B(c) may be rescinded “only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances.” Section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act (emphasis added). The statute contains no exceptions to this time bar. Where the statutory language is clear, “that is the end of the matter” and we “must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984); see also Matter of W-F-, supra, at 5-6. Accordingly, we are bound to uphold and apply the plain meaning of the statute as written. Had Congress intended to provide for an exception to the 180-day time limit based on the ineffective assistance of counsel, it could have done so.
 
This conclusion is consistent with the overall statutory scheme of section 242B of the Act. Section 242B was added to the Act by section 545(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978, 5061-65 (enacted Nov. 29, 1990). See generally Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, supra. It was enacted to provide stricter and more comprehensive deportation procedures, particularly for in absentia hearings, to ensure that proceedings are brought to a conclusion with meaningful consequences. See Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3246, at 7 (BIA 1995); Matter of Villalba, Interim Decision 3310, at 5 n.2 (BIA 1997); 136 Cong. Rec. S17,109 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1990); 136 Cong. Rec. H8630 (daily ed. Oct. 2, 1990). The 180-day time limit reflects congressional intent to bring finality to in absentia deportation proceedings.
 
Therefore, given that the statute is explicit in its requirement that a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days of the in absentia order, and considering the legislative history of section 242B of the Act, we conclude that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not an exception to the 180-day time limit imposed by section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act.
  
*117 V. CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly, we find the respondent is statutorily barred from rescinding the order of deportation based on “exceptional circumstances” pursuant to section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act, regardless of whether he can demonstrate that his failure to timely file the motion is attributable to ineffective assistance of counsel.4
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
Vice Chairman Mary Maguire Dunne and Board Member Lori L. Scialabba did not participate in the decision in this case.
 
CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION: Lory D. Rosenberg, Board Member
I concur in part and dissent in part.
 
Our obligation to enforce the terms of section 242B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b (1994), does not require us to enforce section 242B and its subsections narrowly and restrictively, and it does not preclude us from enforcing section 242B in its entirety, and consistently with the United States Constitution, guided by fairness and compassion. To the contrary, I agree with the majority that we are bound to uphold the statute as written. I cannot agree, however, that the majority’s reading and interpretation of section 242B is true to the terms of the statute, consonant with constitutional due process protections, or consistent with agency precedent and authority.
 
**4 The respondent in this case was represented by counsel and was present in court on January 31, 1995, with his attorney. The Immigration Judge continued the hearing and set October 10, 1995, as the next date on which the respondent was to appear before the Immigration Court. Then, something happened that the respondent had no reason to anticipate: 3 months later, on April 27, 1995, the Immigration Court sent a notice by certified mail to the respondent’s attorney, rescheduling the hearing from October 10, 1995, to September 14, 1995. The respondent never received any notification that his continued hearing date had been canceled, and that he was expected to appear on a rescheduled date prior to the originally continued date, because that notice was sent only to his attorney, who never notified the respondent of the rescheduled date.
 
Twelve days after the Immigration Judge conducted the continued *118 deportation hearing on September 14, 1995, in absentia, the respondent’s former attorney filed a “motion to reopen,” contending in a declaration that she had not received (actual) notice of the rescheduled hearing and that there was the “possibility of having confusion.” Compare section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act (involving exceptional circumstances that prevented a respondent’s appearance, requiring filing of such a motion within 180 days), with section 242B(c)(3)(B) (involving failure of proper notice that prevented a respondent’s appearance, specifying that such a motion may be filed at any time). When the Immigration Judge denied that motion 2 months later, the respondent appealed, and when a panel of the Board upheld the denial 5 months after that, more than 180 days had passed. The respondent, through present counsel, filed a second motion under section 242B(c)(3), which is the subject of our decision today.
 
Although the respondent’s former attorney did not assert previously that “exceptional circumstances” existed for the respondent’s failure to appear, she admits, in the motion to reopen now before us filed by present counsel, that she was unfamiliar with the requirements of section 242B and did not prepare an adequate motion prior to the expiration of the 180-day period. The respondent’s former attorney apparently failed to understand that the plain language of the statute had never been interpreted by the Board to grant a hearing to an alien who had not personally received notice of a rescheduled hearing, despite the language of section 242B(c)(3)(B), and she provided no claim or argument in favor of such a construction. She apparently was unaware of, or ignored, the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a) (1995), which provide that when a respondent is subject to any requirement of the Act, service on counsel of record satisfies service on the respondent.
 
She must not have known, or failed to understand, that she was deemed to have been given notice under our precedent decision in Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3246 (BIA 1995), since notice of the rescheduled hearing had been sent to her by certified mail. Cf. Matter of Huete, 20 I&N Dec. 250 (BIA 1991). She therefore failed to address the fact that the responsibility to notify the respondent was hers alone, whether she received actual notice or not. Finally, former counsel apparently did not understand that, although a claim of inadequate notice was not time-barred, a claim of exceptional circumstances had to be made within 180 days, and prudence dictated that such a motion be filed.
 
**5 A deportation or removal hearing often involves an individual’s potential separation from family, home, employment, and community, and, in some cases, his or her very freedom and liberty. The respondent did not receive notice of his rescheduled, continued deportation hearing and then did not seek to rescind the resulting in absentia deportation order on “exceptional circumstances” grounds within the 180-day time period provided by statute due to circumstances entirely beyond his control. He should not be *119 denied his day in court unless absolutely mandated or voluntarily waived.
 
The Board has long frowned upon the ready dismissal of a respondent’s claims based on technicalities. See Matter of Martinez-Solis, 14 I&N Dec. 93, 95 (BIA 1972) (holding that a contested deportation hearing is a “quest for truth,” not a sporting event); Matter of K-H-C-, 5 I&N Dec. 312, 314 (BIA 1953). The propriety of an in absentia deportation order in response to the respondent’s failure to appear must be based on the totality of the factual circumstances, in the context of all of the statutory provisions pertaining to issuance of in absentia deportation orders and related constitutional due process protections.1 See Matter of J-P-, Interim Decision 3348 (BIA 1998).
 
Comparing sections 242B(c)(1) and 242B(c)(3)(A) and (B) of the Act, I find that the language of these subsections of the statute provides three related, but independent bases that support sustaining the respondent’s appeal and granting his motion to reopen. First, the respondent did not “receive notice in accordance with section (a)(2)” as required by the statute. Section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Act. Second, the respondent’s former attorney failed to provide him with proper notice as contemplated by the statute, regulations, administrative precedent, and generally accepted principles of effective representation in the context of an attorney-client relationship. Third, the attorney’s obvious unfamiliarity or disregard of the provisions of section 242B pertaining to notice and “exceptional circumstances,” and her failure to comply with the Board’s requirements for establishing (her own) ineffective assistance of counsel and the statute’s requirements for rescinding an in absentia deportation order under section 242B(c)(3)(A) by filing a timely motion to reopen on those grounds, is ineffective assistance of counsel that constitutes “exceptional circumstances.”
 
Nevertheless, the majority declines to consider the motion before us as a “notice” motion as well as an “exceptional circumstances” motion under section 242B(c)(3) of the Act, despite the fact that it is premised both on the former attorney’s ineffective counsel for failing to inform the respondent of his rescheduled hearing date, and on later failing to file a motion within 180 days to rescind the resulting deportation order. Furthermore, although it is clear that the attorney’s failure to comply with the statutory deadline compounds her ineffective assistance (in not notifying the respondent of the rescheduled hearing date for which a certified mail receipt was signed by *120 her office staff), the majority construes such circumstances as absolutely impeding the respondent’s ability to invoke the statute’s “exceptional circumstances” ground as a basis for rescinding the in absentia order.
 
**6 The majority’s interpretation of the statute is contrary to principles of equity and is not a reasonable interpretation of the provision, as it forecloses any remedy for a respondent who exercised his right to counsel, but was the victim of ineffective assistance that both violated his basic right of notice and ignored the statute’s jurisdictional requirements. This result is contrary to the statutory language and the guarantee of fairness and due process of law in deportation proceedings. Consequently, I dissent.
 
I. FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS AND CONTROLLING CIRCUIT LAW
Our role in conducting rather than foreclosing hearings is emphasized by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in which this case arises, and is viewed as furthering the interests of due process. See Baires v. INS, 856 F.2d 89, 91 (9th Cir. 1988). Furthermore, other circuit courts of appeals that have addressed access to a deportation hearing under section 242B of the Act have indicated a concern with the Board’s unnecessarily narrow, literal reading of the statutory in absentia provisions. See, e.g., Romero-Morales v. INS, 25 F.3d 125, 131 (2d Cir. 1994) (finding the Immigration Judge’s “failure to examine the particulars of the case before him” in the context of “either issuing the in absentia ruling or denying the motion to reopen,” which the Board affirmed, “disquieting”).
 
It is well established that “(a)n alien is entitled to due process under the Fifth Amendment in his deportation hearing.” Rios-Berrios v. INS, 776 F.2d 859, 861 (9th Cir. 1985) (citing United States v. Barraza-Leon, 575 F.2d 218, 220 (9th Cir. 1978)).2 In Sharma v. INS, 89 F.3d 545, 548 (9th Cir. 1996), the Ninth Circuit reaffirmed that “(d)ue process, in deportation proceedings, • includes the right to a full and fair hearing.’ *121 Getachew v. INS, 25 F.3d 841, 845 (9th Cir. 1994). Petitioners cannot complain of an order entered in absentia, however, if they •voluntarily choose() not to attend a deportation hearing which may affect (them) adversely.’ United States v. Dekermenjian, 508 F.2d 812, 814 (9th Cir.1974).” (Emphasis added.)
 
The right to be present at one’s deportation hearing arises from the statutory language and from due process considerations that involve issues of personal liberty.3 It also is related to the concern for reliability in deportation proceedings, which often involve highly complex facts regarding a respondent’s attributes and activities and require the respondent’s testimony to properly adjudicate the case. See, e.g., Purba v. INS, 884 F.2d 516, 517-18 (9th Cir. 1989) (holding that the statutory language of section 242(b), combined with significance of credibility determinations in deportation matters, supports a bright-line rule requiring physical presence before the Immigration Judge). In addition, although a respondent has no Sixth Amendment right to appointment of counsel at government expense, “due process mandates that he is entitled to counsel of his own choice at his own expense under terms of the Immigration and Nationality Act.” Rios-Berrios v. INS, supra, at 861. As the Ninth Circuit has recognized, “Section 292 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1362 (1982), makes that privilege explicit.” Id.; see also section 292 of the Act.
 
**7 It is difficult to imagine what could be more prejudicial to a respondent charged with being deportable from the United States than denial of an opportunity to be present at his deportation hearing where he might provide any defenses to the charges against him, or advance any claims he may have for relief from deportation. See Iris Gomez, The Consequences of Nonappearance: Interpreting New Section 242B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 30 San Diego L. Rev. 75, 107-08 (1993); section 242(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b) (1994);4 see also Maldonado-Perez v. INS, 865 F.2d 328, 333 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (holding that the Act implements constitutional requirements of a fair hearing).
 
Once an alien has been ordered deported in absentia, section 242B(c)(3) permits only two grounds for rescinding the order: either that the alien did not receive proper notice, or that certain defined “exceptional *122 circumstances” exist. The essence of a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia order is that it is a request for discretionary action -- as an exception to allowing an in absentia order to stand -- in order to resolve a case fairly and justly. See section 242B(c)(3) (stating that an in absentia order “may be rescinded” only upon a showing that the “alien did not receive notice” or of “exceptional circumstances”) (emphasis added). Such discretionary exceptions to the in absentia rule ensure that a deportation order is not issued in violation of the universally accepted principle of notice and an opportunity to be heard, and they favor individual consideration, not a blanket prohibition such as that contained in the majority opinion.
 
In my view, the majority errs in concluding that, under the terms of the statute, we do not have any latitude to find that an attorney’s failure to notify the respondent to appear, followed by her failure to file a timely motion asserting exceptional circumstances attributable to such conduct, constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel amounting to a prejudicial violation of due process, which we may remedy by rescinding the deportation order and reopening the proceedings. Baires v. INS, supra, at 91 (holding that administrative expediency must give way to protection of fundamental rights); Matter of W-F-, Interim Decision 3288 (BIA 1996) (Rosenberg, concurring and dissenting). In Rios-Berrios v. INS, supra, at 863-64, the Ninth Circuit stated, “We are not in favor of an agency treating the statutes and regulations by which it is governed as casually as it viewed them here. We will continue to take a close look at a claim such as that raised by petitioner, especially where so fundamental a question as right to counsel of one’s choice is concerned.” These principles are equally applicable to “so fundamental a question as” a respondent’s right to notice and to be present at his deportation hearing.
 
II. STATUTORY GROUNDS FOR GRANTING THE RESPONDENT’S MOTION
In addition to the constitutional considerations addressed above, my reasons for dissenting in light of the statutory language are threefold. First, I disagree with the majority’s limited treatment of the motion before us as subject to the 180-day deadline under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act, when it has been demonstrated that the respondent did not receive notice, under section 242B(c)(3)(B), which authorizes granting a motion to reopen based on failure of notice “at any time.” Second, in the alternative, I find that rescission of the order is warranted based on the motion before us today, as it demonstrates clearly that -- due to ineffective assistance of counsel -- the respondent did not receive actual notice as the statute requires. See section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Act; see also Matter of N-K- & V-S-, Interim Decision 3312 (BIA 1997) (finding that failure to provide proper *123 notice constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
**8 Third, I disagree with the majority’s limited interpretation of the effect of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3284 (BIA 1996) (finding that a respondent who did not receive proper notice from his attorney and who has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), has established ineffective assistance of counsel based on “exceptional circumstances,” warranting rescission of an in absentia order). Our decision in Grijalva neither forecloses rescission “at any time” when failure to appear is based on lack of receipt of notice due to ineffective counsel, nor does it prohibit rescission when ineffective assistance of counsel results in counsel’s failure to file a timely motion under section 242B(c)(3)(A). It is unreasonable to read the statutory deadline to preclude any and all remedies to rescission of an order that was entered unfairly, particularly when acceptable alternatives exist to preserve the respondent’s access to a hearing.
 
As I have noted in several published dissents, neither the statutory language nor the legislative history supports an interpretation of the statute that renders section 242B(c) of the Act as more a penalty provision than a deliberate measure to achieve prompt determinations and closure in the cases of deportable aliens. The overriding objective of Congress in enacting section 545 of the Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978, 5061-67, was to bring aliens to their hearings, and the legislative history does not contain a punitive intent. See generally Gomez, supra, at part II.B (1993) (stating that S. 358, a later Conference Committee report incorporated certain previously excluded enforcement provisions to ensure that aliens were properly notified and in fact would appear for their hearings).
 
A. Failure of Proper Notice Based on the Plain Language of the Statute
The statute authorizes rescission when a respondent demonstrates that he has not received notice. See section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Act. The verb used in section 242B(a)(2) -- to “give” -- and the verb used in section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Act -- to “receive” -- are distinct. See also section 242B(a)(1) (using the verb “give”). Similarly, the verb used in section 242B(c)(1) -- to “provide” is different from the verb to “receive,” as used in section 242B(c)(3)(B).
 
Section 242B(c)(1) of the Act states in relevant part that an alien who does not attend a proceeding “after written notice required under subsection (a)(2) has been provided to the alien or the alien’s counsel of record” shall be ordered deported in absentia “if the Service establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided.” (Emphasis added.) By contrast, section 242B(c)(3)(B) states that an in absentia order may be rescinded, “at any time if the alien demonstrates *124 that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with subsection (a)(2).” (Emphasis added.) Thus, according to section 242B(c)(3)(B), notice that was “provided” to the respondent’s attorney but not to the respondent (that otherwise might satisfy the requirements of section 242B(a)(2) for purposes of showing that notice was “given”) does not preclude rescission and reopening when, as here, the respondent did not receive notice. See section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Act; cf. sections 242B(a)(2), (c)(1); see also Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3246 (recognizing that provision of notice might be challenged on the basis that notice was never received).
 
**9 It may be true that to “give” is better than to “receive,” but no matter how that moral question is resolved, it cannot be denied that to “give” is different from to “receive.” First, the act of “giving” or “providing” notice refers to the conduct of one party or entity involved in the event in question, while the state of “receiving” does not involve active conduct and refers to the situation of another party to the proceedings. Second, in the context of these particular subsections of the statute, certified mail service that is given or provided to the respondent’s counsel -- even if deemed to be “received” by counsel -- is not the type of notice that can be said to be “receive(d)” by the alien “in accordance with subsection (a)(2)” under section 242B(c)(3)(B) (referring to section 242B(a)(2)). See Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314, (1950) (holding that “(a)n elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding . . . is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections”).5
 
The language of section 242B(c)(1) of the Act that refers to an alien being “provided” notice refers to the broad language found in section 242B(a)(2), which addresses compliance with due process on the basis that notice was “given.” In the event that “personal service (on the alien) is not practicable,” section 242B(a)(2) allows us to rely on the presumption of regularity of mail delivery to the respondent, or if the respondent is represented, on notice to counsel, as constituting service of notice on “the alien.” See Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3246; cf. Matter of Huete, 20 I&N Dec. 250 (BIA 1991) (recognizing that the respondent cannot comply with his *125 initial statutory obligation unless he receives actual notice of the Order to Show Cause, which commences the hearing). By contrast, the language of section 242B(c)(3)(B) does not refer simply to section 242B(a) (2), but modifies the language of that subsection to require that “the alien” must “receive notice” in accordance with section 242B(a)(2).
 
Congress’ use of two different terms in two subsections of the same statute must be construed in a manner that gives each independent effect. See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, (1987). The meaning of section 242B(c)(3)(B) is clear; it is neither ambiguous, nor satisfactorily implemented by a regulation equating service on an alien’s representative with service on the alien. Cf. 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a) (1997) (stating only that when a person is required to give or be given notice or to serve or be served with notice, service on an attorney satisfies the requirement, but not addressing a statutory requirement that notice be received). “If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984). Where Congress’ intent is clearly enacted in unambiguous language, that language is conclusive. Negonsott v. Samuels, 507 U.S. 99, 104 (1993); Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U.S. 564, 570 (1982).
 
**10 Congress must be deemed to be aware of the difference between giving and receiving. Furthermore, as the parenthetical clause in the sentence of section 242B(a)(2) that is referred to in section 242B(c)(3)(B) indicates, Congress was well aware of how to draft this alternate method of service by proxy if it so chose. “To determine the plain meaning and purpose of a portion of a statute, we must examine not only the specific provisions at issue, but also the structure of the law as a whole including its object and policy.” Almero v. INS, 18 F.3d 757, 760 (9th Cir. 1994); see also Coit Independence Joint Venture v. Federal Sav. & Loan Ins. Corp., 489 U.S. 561 (1989) (stating that “whole statute” interpretation dictates that statutory sections should be read in harmony to achieve a harmonious whole); In re Bonner Mall Partnership, 2 F.3d 899 (9th Cir. 1993); Matter of W-F-, supra (citing K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 291 (1988)(ruling that a construction of the statutory language which takes into account the design of the statute as a whole is preferred)).
 
In section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the statute, Congress unambiguously provided that rescission may be appropriate where the respondent demonstrates that he did not receive notice to appear. Although section 242B(c)(1) and the subsections preceding it permit proceedings to be conducted on the presumption that notice is received by requiring only that notice be “given,” section 242B(c)(3) -- which preserves the fundamental guarantee of due process such as notice in such proceedings -- invokes the more stringent standard when a respondent claims he did not actually “receive” such *126 notice. We must read and give meaning to the language of these subsections taken together. So read, the statute indicates expressly that when the presumption that such notice was given is challenged by evidence that indicates that actual notice has not been received by the respondent, rescission of a deportation order entered in the respondent’s absence is necessary.
 
B. Violation of (Competent) Counsel’s Duty to Provide Notice
 
As a corollary to the above reading of the statutory language, I find it appropriate to consider the role of retained counsel in relation to the statutory scheme concerning notice to the respondent. This is even more important if my first point -- that the statutory language is plain and reading it to provide expressly for actual “receipt” of notice by the respondent is harmonious with the statute as a whole -- is subject to doubt. Although the statute addresses the role of counsel to a limited extent, stating that if personal service on the respondent is not practicable, service by certified mail may be made on counsel, it is silent regarding circumstances in which notice to counsel is, in reality, not equivalent to notice to the respondent. Therefore, the second point to be addressed is counsel’s ineffective representation as impeding notice as required by the statute.
 
**11 Counsel is expected to represent the interests of her client, and under the provisions of section 242B of the Act, failure to notify the respondent when and where to appear after an attorney has been notified, and failure to advise the respondent of the severe consequences and few cures associated with a failure to appear, most certainly constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel on the merits. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 690 (1984) (holding that “the proper standard for attorney performance is that of reasonably effective assistance” and determining “whether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance . . . keep(ing) in mind that counsel’s function, as elaborated in prevailing professional norms, is to make the adversarial testing process work in the particular case”).
 
We have held that when an attorney fails to provide proper notice to her client, such ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes “exceptional circumstances” within the meaning of section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Act. See, e.g., Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3284 (holding that circumstances in which improper notice from counsel frustrated a respondent’s opportunity to appear before the Immigration Judge demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel and rendered an order issued in the subsequent proceeding an unfair one that should not stand).6 In addition, the Board has ruled that *127 reopening of deportation proceedings is required when, because of ineffective assistance of counsel, “the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.” Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638.7
 
The record before us reflects on its face that former counsel (who was well aware that the respondent was a lawful permanent resident subject to a condition, the removal of which was the subject of the deportation hearing) had received notice of the continued hearing, inasmuch as the notice was sent by certified mail and was signed for by someone purportedly at the location indicated on former counsel’s pleadings. Both the statute and the regulations provide that, colloquially speaking, when a respondent is represented by counsel, notice to counsel is notice to the respondent. See sections 242B(a)(2), (c)(1) of the Act; see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.26, 292.5 (1997).
 
I note that we deem counsel adequate to accept service and to make binding representations on a client’s behalf. See 8 C.F.R. § 292; see also Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (holding that counsel’s admission and concession of his client’s deportability is binding on a respondent). We ought to, similarly, acknowledge that counsel’s failure to notify the respondent, when she is treated by the regulations and the statute as the respondent’s proxy, not only constitutes a breach of her duty and establishes ineffective assistance of counsel, but results in a failure of notice under the explicit language of section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act. Strickland v. Washington, supra.
 
**12 In Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3246, we acknowledged specifically that “(t)he enactment of section 242B responds to some of the concerns raised in an October 1989 United States General Accounting Office (•GAO’) report on delays in the deportation process and the substantial number of aliens who fail to appear for their scheduled deportation hearings. The . . . report . . . recommended several solutions to this problem, including developing procedures to improve the notification process . . . .”  *128 Id. at 6 (citations omitted). Mindful of our inability to guarantee notice in each and every case, we held that effective notice by the Immigration Court was presumed by proper delivery, but provided that this presumption could be overcome by an affirmative defense in the form of documentary evidence from the Postal Service, third party affidavits, or other similar evidence demonstrating that there was improper delivery or that nondelivery was not attributable to the respondent. Id.
 
Congress’ emphasis on fair and proper notice as part and parcel of its objective to see that hearings were convened, conducted, and completed could not be more clear.8 The amendments to the statute in 1990 did not merely impose more severe sanctions for failure to appear at deportation hearings and other points in the removal process. These amendments attached more stringent and exacting notice requirements to deportation proceedings than had existed previously. For example, according to the statute, an in absentia deportation order may be issued only upon clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence, introduced by the Service, that the respondent had notice of the hearing and failed to attend, as well as that the respondent is deportable by evidence which is clear, unequivocal, and convincing. See section 242B(c)(1) of the Act. The evidence before us includes the respondent’s statement that he never received notice from his former attorney or from any other source, and statements submitted by former counsel substantiate this fact. These circumstances amount to a failure of notice under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act due to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
C. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel as “Exceptional Circumstances”
Under circumstances in which notice was provided to respondent’s counsel, but she did not inform him of the notice, neither nonfeasance nor malfeasance on her part should be allowed to prejudice the respondent’s *129 right to a hearing.9 According to the statute and to our regulations, respondent’s former counsel was charged with the responsibility of notifying him of any continued or rescheduled hearing for which she received notice in his stead. According to the record, it is undisputed that she did not do so. Consequently, I conclude that, on the merits, the respondent has demonstrated “exceptional circumstances” for his failure to appear.
 
It is important to note the centrality of notice in cases decided under section 242B, and the continuing emphasis in the statute on a reasonable opportunity to be present. In Fuentes-Argueta v. INS, 101 F.3d 867 (2d Cir. 1996), the court recognized that “without repealing § 242(b), Congress amended the Act to add § 242B, a more stringent provision requiring (rather than merely permitting) the IJ to issue in absentia orders of deportation where the INS establishes deportability by •clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence.”’ Id. at 871 (citing Romero-Morales v. INS, supra, at 128). The court also stated: “(A)mong the differences between § 242(b) and § 242B, the latter sets forth a stricter notice requirement. See United States v. Perez-Valdera, 899 F. Supp. 181, 185 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (observing that, because consequences of alien’s failure to appear are more severe under § 242B, notice requirements under that section were •strengthened’).” Fuentes-Argueta v. INS, supra, at 870.
 
**13 Neither a statute nor a regulation can be read as operating to deny the respondent notice of his deportation hearing and be upheld as constitutional. I believe it is improper to refuse the respondent his day in court when it is plain on the face of the record that counsel’s reckless disregard, negligence, good faith error, or any other explanation for her failure to act is responsible for the respondent’s failure to appear, and for her failure to file a motion explicitly claiming exceptional circumstances under section 242B(c)(3)(A) within the statutory deadline.
 
To read the statute as foreclosing a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia order when the exceptional circumstances claimed are that counsel was ineffective in not notifying the respondent of his hearing, and that she perpetuated her ineffectiveness by failing to file a timely motion to rescind, unreasonably frustrates the operation of the statutory provision for an entire subclass of cases in which we would have found exceptional circumstances *130 under our decision in Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3284. Given that Congress has not plainly indicated an intent to foreclose motions that rest on “exceptional circumstances” alleged to constitute not only the reason for a respondent’s failure to appear, but the reason for his failing to meet the filing deadline contained in section 242B (c)(3)(B), the majority’s interpretation is inconsistent with the statute’s purpose of affording rescission of orders of deportation that were entered in the respondent’s absence, despite “compelling reasons beyond the control of the alien.” Id.; see also Romero v. INS, 39 F.3d 977, 981 (9th Cir. 1994) (citing United States v. Witkovich, 353 U.S. 194 (1957) (rejecting an interpretation of a statute affecting the liberty interests of aliens that would raise doubts as to the statute’s validity, based on the “•cardinal principle”’ favoring adoption of a construction of the statute “•by which the (constitutional) question may be avoided”’ (quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 62 (1932))).
 
Furthermore, it is self-evident that the respondent’s loss of an opportunity to present his defenses to deportation and his claims for discretionary relief from deportation before the Immigration Judge, as a result of the operation of section 242B(c)(1), constitutes prejudice. Cf. Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 1984); cf. also Waldron v. INS, 17 F.3d 511, 518 (2d Cir. 1993) (holding no showing of prejudice required where a fundamental right is at stake), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1014 (1994); Sewak v. INS, 900 F.2d 667, 670 n.7 (3d Cir. 1990) (rejecting harmless error doctrine where respondent did not receive notice of hearing); Shahandah-Pey v. INS, 831 F.2d 1384, 1389 (7th Cir. 1987) (finding prejudice in violation of procedural protection if it “had the potential for affecting the outcome” of the hearing); Colindres-Aguilar v. INS, 819 F.2d 259 (9th Cir. 1987) (finding prejudice not harmless where counsel could have better marshaled facts in asylum case and sought voluntary departure); Paul v. INS, 521 F.2d 194, 197 (5th Cir. 1975) (concluding that since it was the attorney who caused the hearing to be fundamentally unfair, the result of that hearing cannot be permitted to stand).
 
III. EQUITABLE RELIEF REQUIRED TO ENSURE FAIR TREATMENT
**14 Admittedly, the statute forecloses rescission when an alien files a motion based on exceptional circumstances for failure to appear after the expiration of the 180-day filing period designated by the statute. But, the statute does not address squarely the situation before us, in which the failure to file a motion within the 180-day period itself is attributable to ineffective counsel, which is the same basis for the claim of “exceptional circumstances” for failure to appear under section 242B(c)(3)(B) due to the fact that the respondent did not receive notice of the hearing. Furthermore, both judicial and administrative authority allows us to avoid imposing a *131 statutory bar when due process has been violated and to cure various defects in proceedings, if such treatment would equitably resolve a case. See Batanic v. INS, 12 F.3d 662, 667 (7th Cir. 1993); Matter of Garcia, Interim Decision 3268 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Lok, 18 I&N Dec. 101, 107 (BIA 1981), aff’d, 681 F.2d 107 (2d Cir. 1982); Matter of Vrettakos, 14 I&N Dec. 593 (BIA 1973, A.G. 1974).
 
In Singh v. Waters, 87 F.3d 346, 346-347 (9th Cir. 1996), the Ninth Circuit stated that to ensure the fair treatment of aliens within our borders,
Congress has created immigration judges, who, although they do not have the security of life tenure, are intended to act as judges -- that is, as persons fearlessly and impartially applying the laws of the United States to the agency to which they are assigned; and whose orders are to be obeyed by such agency as the orders of other judges of the United States are to be obeyed. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b).
 
 
This message applies no less to our resolution of appeals from the decisions of Immigration Judges. Yet, the majority contends that the issue presented is simply whether there exists a statutory exception to the requirement that a motion to rescind on the grounds of exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days of the in absentia order, and it concludes that no such exception exists. That construction of the statute, however, begs the question. It not only avoids the failure of notice ground discussed above, but rests on a rigid reading of the language contrary to our own understanding of the significance of ineffective assistance of counsel and its relationship to a fair hearing process.
 
Clearly, Congress contemplated enforcement of the statutory language. Nevertheless, an order resulting from ineffective assistance of counsel is no more acceptable than it would be otherwise, merely because former counsel failed to assert such ineffectiveness within the statutory 180-day period provided for a motion to rescind. As stated above, we are charged with giving effect to Congress’ intentions in a manner that comports with constitutional principles. Thus, I believe we must consider what permissible alternatives exist that can accommodate enforcement of the statute without compromising due process.
 
**15 Even if the majority persists in refusing to construe the respondent’s motion as one raising failure of notice -- to which no statutory time limitation is tied -- the majority unreasonably declines to exercise our residual administrative authority to ameliorate the undeniable exceptional circumstances that flow from former counsel’s multiple errors. Cf. Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3284. Our authority to construe the statute as permitting us to consider an “exceptional circumstances” motion after the passage of 180 days when the claim is ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to file a motion to rescind before the statutory period passes has not been foreclosed by Congress or by the Attorney General and is supported by judicial decisions. In the face of such a blatant due process violation, a *132 statutory provision that might otherwise preclude us from acting need not limit our ability to restore the respondent to the position he would have held but for that violation. See Snajder v. INS, 29 F.3d 1203, 1207-08 (7th Cir. 1994).
 
The extension of equitable relief in the context of statutory and discretionary aspects of deportation proceedings has long been accepted as within the province of the Board to fashion. We have invoked such authority historically by designating certain determinations made on the basis of our authority to achieve an equitable result as being effective “nunc pro tunc.” See Black’s Law Dictionary 1069 (6th ed. 1990); Matter of Garcia, supra (Guendelsberger, joined by Schmidt, dissenting); see also Matter of L-, 1 I&N Dec. 1, 5 (BIA, A.G. 1940) (finding, in the first case decided by the Board under the delegated authority of the Attorney General, that it would be capricious to conclude that “the technical form of the proceedings” determined the result). Furthermore, we have found nunc pro tunc relief appropriate in cases going back for more than 50 years, even prior to the enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, ch. 477, 66 Stat. 163. Matter of Garcia, supra (citing Matter of S-N-, 6 I&N Dec. 73, 76 (BIA, A.G. 1954) (reporting the Attorney General’s ruling that the 1952 Act provided no reason to abandon or reverse the practice of affording relief nunc pro tunc)).
 
We have exercised our administrative authority periodically to enter nunc pro tunc determinations that achieve equitable results serving the interests of the agency and the individual alike. As I discussed in Matter of Yeung, Interim Decision 3297 (BIA 1996; 1997) (Rosenberg, dissenting), such action has been invoked as a justice-based remedy in which “•complete justice to an alien dictates such an extraordinary action”’ and “•the record before us presents many sympathetic and mitigating factors.”’ Id. at 14 (quoting Matter of T-, 6 I&N Dec. 410, 412 (BIA 1954) (considering whether an application filed under the 1917 Act was subject to the terms of the 1952 Act)). Furthermore, we have taken such action as an efficiency-based remedy, in which nunc pro tunc relief was warranted to achieve an appropriate and necessary disposition of the case. Matter of Vrettakos, supra, at 599 (BIA 1973, A.G. 1974); see also Matter of Ng, 17 I&N Dec. 63 (BIA 1979); Matter of Ducret, 15 I&N Dec. 620 (BIA 1976); Matter of Rapacon, 14 I&N Dec. 375 (R.C. 1973); Matter of Farinas, 12 I&N Dec. 467 (BIA 1967); cf. Matter of C-, 20 I&N Dec. 529, 531 (BIA 1992) (rejecting the argument that an asylum application should be deemed constructively filed prior to the amended statute’s effective date, where there was no showing that fundamental rights were abridged or that the applicant would benefit).
 
**16 Nunc pro tunc relief is not restricted to the above cited situations by statute, agency definition or policy, or generally accepted principles of jurisprudence. Ordinarily, when a situation occurs in which an alleged procedural *133 error is made -- ranging from a mistranslation attributable to a court interpreter, to the inappropriate exclusion of evidence, to failure to advise of the right to counsel -- such errors are cured by simply holding a new hearing “in compliance with due process requirements,” which restores the wronged applicant to the position in which he found himself prior to the procedural error. Batanic v. INS, supra, at 667; see also Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d 879, 882-84 (2d Cir. 1994) (finding ineffective counsel’s failure to file a timely application for a waiver to violate the respondent’s rights and require reopening); Shahandeh-Pey v. INS, supra, at 1390 (remanding to allow an alien denied the opportunity to present evidence and to “have his day in court” and present all of his evidence in support of his application for asylum in lieu of deportation).
 
Violations of procedural due process generally “call for the prophylactic remedy of vacating the order of deportation and for writing thereafter on a clean slate.” Castaneda-Delgado v. INS, 525 F.2d 1295, 1302 (7th Cir. 1975); see also Matter of Santos, supra (requiring that such procedural violations are prejudicial). When holding another hearing does not cure the defect in the prior proceeding or make the prejudiced applicant “whole,” however, we are forced to look beyond such routine remedies.
 
There is no question but that the respondent’s motion claiming exceptional circumstances -- ineffective assistance of counsel -- was not filed within 180 days because of ineffective assistance of the same counsel. If we insist on limiting his motion to one asserting only “exceptional circumstances,” we must consider nunc pro tunc relief. Batanic v. INS, supra (holding that where denial of the right to counsel deprived the respondent of his right to apply for asylum, counsel’s ability to protect the respondent’s rights in a reconvened hearing must include the ability to apply for asylum nunc pro tunc). In particular, “when the procedural defect has also resulted in the loss of an opportunity for statutory relief,” the demands of due process require more than merely reconvening the hearing. Id. at 667 (emphasis added). When a violation of due process results in a denial of a fair hearing on the question of eligibility for discretionary relief, the respondent should be afforded the opportunity for consideration of his claim based upon the law as it existed at the time he was deprived of his rights. Snajder v. INS, supra, at 1208 n.12.
 
The process due the respondent -- an opportunity to present his motion for consideration pursuant to section 242B(c)(3) of the statute, in light of our ruling in Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3284 -- has not become moot, as the majority suggests, due to expiration of the 180-day statutory period. Instead, the process due the respondent requires that the respondent be given the advantage of the exceptional circumstances grounds available under the statute when his counsel filed a motion to reopen based on notice, and failed to include the equally applicable exceptional circumstances grounds, and when, after rejection of that motion, she failed to file a timely *134 motion claiming exceptional circumstances. To refuse to recognize ineffective assistance of counsel when that ineffective assistance itself is the cause for a tardy filing of a motion to rescind on such grounds, unreasonably limits our holding in Matter of Grijalva, and results in a denial of due process. In other words, in fairness, since it was his counsel’s error that caused the 180-day deadline to pass without a proper motion having been filed, the respondent should “be given the advantage of the law that existed when his first hearing was held.” Batanic v. INS, supra, at 668.
 
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
**17 In summary, I find that although sections 242B(a)(1) and (2) of the Act require only that written notice be “given” to a respondent (and that if personal service is not practicable, it may “be given” by certified mail to the respondent or his counsel), the notice provision in section 242B(c)(3)(B) specifically requires that such written notice is “receive(d)” by the respondent. On the facts presented, I would find that the respondent has established ineffective representation compromising his rights to proper notice of his deportation hearing, as well as constituting exceptional circumstances, amounting to a violation of due process in either case. Baires v. INS, supra.
 
Reading the statute to allow rescission “at any time” when the respondent demonstrates that he has not actually received notice of a rescheduled hearing is consistent with the statute’s plain language and with our precedent. See 242B(c)(3)(B) (requiring that notice is “received”); Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3246 (allowing rebuttal of the presumption of effective service when the statute requires only that notice “shall be given”). Furthermore, viewing the failure to advise the respondent of the proper hearing date as ineffective assistance of counsel that constitutes “exceptional circumstances” under the statute, as we do in Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3284, does not preclude conceiving of ineffective counsel as violating the statutory notice requirements.
 
Contrary to the conclusion drawn by the majority, it is not appropriate to ignore or limit the plain terms of section 242B(c)(3)(B).
 
If the respondent was not provided with and did not receive actual notice of his rescheduled hearing, it is an abuse of our discretion to refuse to rescind the Immigration Judge’s order of deportation and reopen the respondent’s hearing. A fair evaluation of the “totality of the circumstances,” as contemplated by Congress when section 242B was enacted, compels the conclusion that the respondent is entitled to a hearing at which he can present his defenses to deportation and any claims for discretionary relief or other benefits that he may wish to advance. See Matter of Rivera, Interim Decision 3296 (BIA 1996) (Schmidt, dissenting, joined by *135 Guendelsberger, Rosenberg, and Villageliu). Therefore, I would construe the instant motion under both subsections of section 242B(c)(3) and grant it as a motion to rescind based on “notice,” which can be considered “at any time.” In the alternative, I would adjudicate the respondent’s present motion nunc pro tunc and find that the ineffective assistance of former counsel in failing to timely file a motion under section 242B(c)(3)(A) constitutes “exceptional circumstances” and allows rescission outside the 180-day cutoff date for equitable reasons. I would do so primarily because such reconsideration is within our authority and justice so requires. I also would take such action because to fail to do so perpetuates a violation of the statute that I believe constitutes an error of constitutional proportions.
 
CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION: John W. Guendelsberger, Board Member
**18 I concur in part and dissent in part.
 
I concur with the majority’s analysis regarding the respondent’s inability to rescind the in absentia order of deportation under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3)(A) (1994), given the expiration of the 180-day time limitation for such motions. However, I would examine the respondent’s eligibility to rescind under section 242B(c)(3)(B), for cases involving lack of notice. Although the applicability of this alternate avenue for rescission is not explicitly raised on appeal, the issue should be addressed, in light of the respondent’s assertion that he never received notice of his hearing.
 
Section 242B(a)(2)(A) of the Act, which governs the method of providing notice in deportation proceedings, states in relevant part:
Written notice shall be given in person to the alien (or, if personal service is not practicable, written notice shall be given by certified mail to the alien or to the alien’s counsel of record, if any) . . . .
 
 
 
 
 
Section 242B(c)(1) of the Act sets forth the circumstances under which a hearing may be held in absentia:
Consequences of failure to appear.--
 
(1) In general.--Any alien who, after written notice required under subsection (a)(2) has been provided to the alien or the alien’s counsel of record, does not attend a proceeding under section 242, shall be ordered deported under section 242(b)(1) in absentia if the Service establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien is deportable.
 
 
 
In the instant case, the respondent’s attorney was given written notice of the respondent’s hearing by certified mail, in accordance with subsection (a)(2). Thus, the Immigration Judge properly held a hearing in absentia *136 under subsection (c)(1), as notice was provided to “the alien’s counsel of record.” However, the fact that notice is provided in accordance with section 242B(a)(2) of the Act does not conclusively resolve the issue of sufficiency of notice for the purposes of reopening to rescind under section 242B(c)(3)(B). That subsection provides, in pertinent part:
Rescission of order.--Such an order may be rescinded only--
. . .
 
(B) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with subsection (a)(2) . . . .
 
 
 
 
 
Notably, while subsection (c)(1) permits a hearing to be held in absentia where an alien fails to attend a proceeding “after written notice required under subsection (a)(2) has been provided to the alien or alien’s counsel” (emphasis added), section 242B(c)(3)(B) permits an alien to rescind such an order where the alien can demonstrate that “the alien did not receive notice in accordance with subsection (a)(2)” (emphasis added). The difference in the statutory language between these two sections is significant. Congress could have used the same wording in both sections, but instead focused only upon receipt by the alien for purposes of rescission. This variance in the statutory language demonstrates that Congress intended for the alien, as opposed to the alien’s counsel as agent, to have notice of his or her hearing for purposes of rescinding under section 242B(c)(3)(B). See, e.g., INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 432 (1987) (applying the principle of statutory construction that where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposefully in the disparate inclusion or exclusion). Therefore, even where the respondent’s attorney is served with notice in accordance with subsection (a)(2), which is sufficient notice under subsection (c)(1) for purposes of conducting a hearing in absentia, the alien should still be permitted to rescind the order under subsection (c)(3)(B) upon demonstrating that “the alien did not receive notice.”
 
**19 Our decision in Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3246 (BIA 1995), involved a similar issue of lack of notice under section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Act. In that case, the alien was served notice in accordance with section 242B(a)(2), by certified mail to the alien’s last known address. The certified mail return receipt was returned as unclaimed, following notices of certified mail provided to the alien by the United States Postal Service. The Board held that where service of a notice of hearing in deportation proceedings is sent by certified mail through the United States Postal Service, and there is proof of attempted delivery and notification of certified mail, a strong presumption of effective service arises which may be overcome by the affirmative *137 defense of nondelivery or improper delivery by the Postal Service. The alien asserted that he never received the notice of hearing or the notices of certified mail from the Postal Service, and we remanded the case to allow the alien an opportunity to demonstrate nondelivery or improper delivery of the notice, through no fault of the alien. Id. at 17.
 
Although Matter of Grijalva, supra, involved service of written notice directly upon the alien, a similar opportunity to demonstrate nondelivery should be available in the situation presented in the instant case, in which written notice is mailed to the alien’s attorney. Specifically, the alien should be allowed to demonstrate that his or her counsel failed to convey the notice of hearing to the alien.
 
Furthermore, this approach is not inconsistent with the regulation regarding representative capacity. That regulation, found at 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a) (1997), provides in pertinent part that “(w)henever a person is required . . . to give or be given notice . . . such notice . . . shall be given by or to . . . the attorney or representative of record, or the person himself if unrepresented.” This provision merely indicates to whom service is to be made and does not address whether such service is sufficient notice to the alien to preclude rescission under section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Act.
 
Thus, while the Immigration Judge properly held an in absentia hearing, in light of the evidence that notice in accordance with subsection (a)(2) had been provided to the respondent’s counsel, the respondent should not be precluded under subsection (c)(3)(B) from reopening and rescinding if he can establish lack of actual notice by showing that his attorney did not, in fact, communicate the notice of hearing to him, and that he therefore did not “receive notice” of his hearing. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (prescribing standards for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel). Section 242B(c)(3) does not specify a 180-day limit upon such a motion if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive notice of the hearing.
 
**20 DISSENTING OPINION: Paul W. Schmidt, Chairman
I respectfully dissent.
 
The uncontested evidence establishes that the respondent’s former attorney failed to discharge her duty to notify the respondent of his deportation hearing date and failed herself to appear at the deportation hearing. That conduct resulted in the entry of an in absentia order of deportation against the respondent. Former counsel also admits that, through her unfamiliarity with the proper procedures, she was responsible for failing to file a legally sufficient motion to reopen seeking to rescind the in absentia order within the 180-day statutory time frame. A properly perfected motion should have resulted in reopening and rescission of the in absentia order under our decision in Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3284 (BIA 1996) *138 (holding that ineffective assistance of counsel is an “exceptional circumstance” justifying reopening and rescission of an in absentia order).
 
I disagree with present counsel’s attempt to argue that referral of this matter to the State Bar of California under our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), is inappropriate because former counsel’s conduct would not be a ground for discipline under those rules. First, the record contains ample uncontested evidence of former counsel’s multiple acts of mishandling this case that tends to belie such a claim. Whether or not such conduct violates the Rules of Professional Conduct is a question that must be determined by the State Bar of California, not the respondent’s present counsel.
 
Nevertheless, in this particular case, insistence on satisfaction of the Lozada requirement that the matter be referred to the State Bar as a prerequisite to our recognizing the ineffective assistance claim elevates form over substance. Even more than in Matter of Rivera, Interim Decision 3296 (BIA 1996), a case in which I dissented, the record in the present case clearly establishes ineffective assistance of counsel. We can resolve the “defect” in Lozada compliance by either (1) serving a copy of our decision in this case on the State Bar of California, or (2) referring the matter to the Office of General Counsel of the Executive Office for Immigration Review for investigation of whether further referral to the State Bar or a referral under 8 C.F.R. § 292.3 (1997) (disciplinary regulations relating to immigration proceedings) is appropriate.1 Failure to refer this particular matter to the State Bar is not an appropriate basis for us to decline to recognize the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Because the respondent was deprived of his right to a deportation hearing through the ineffective assistance of counsel, I would reopen this matter sua sponte under 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(a) (1997) and rescind the in absentia *139 order of deportation, notwithstanding the expiration of the 180-day period set forth in section 242B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b (1994), for reopening on the basis of exceptional circumstances. I agree with present counsel that, in the circumstances of this case, invoking the 180-day limit to absolutely bar a claim based on ineffective assistance of counsel raises serious constitutional due process issues. See Matter of J-J-, Interim Decision 3323 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board may reopen on its own motion in exceptional circumstances); cf. Romero-Morales v. INS, 25 F.3d 125 (2d Cir. 1994) (cautioning against an overly mechanical application of section 242B).
 
**21 Finally, I doubt that under the circumstances of this case the respondent can be found to have received legally sufficient notice of his deportation hearing time and place. That is a separate ground for reopening under section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Act that is not subject to any time limitation.
 
For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the denial of the respondent’s motion.
DISSENTING OPINION: Gustavo D. Villageliu, Board Member
 
I respectfully join the dissents of Chairman Paul W. Schmidt and Board Members Lory D. Rosenberg and John W. Guendelsberger. I agree with their conclusion that section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3)(B) (1994), allows rescission of an in absentia deportation order at any time if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive notice of his deportation hearing due to ineffective assistance of counsel.

The decision was affirmed with regard to the issue of lack of notice. However, we rejected that part of the Immigration Judge’s decision which required the respondent to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief.

2

Specifically, the respondent claims that his attorney’s failure to provide him with notice of the hearing constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Most of the respondent’s motion is devoted to discussing whether the attorney’s failure to notify the respondent can be considered an “exceptional circumstance” excusing his failure to appear. However, due to our disposition in this case, we do not reach the substance of the respondent’s motion.

3

We acknowledge that the respondent’s motion to reopen is timely under the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 3.2 (1997), but we note that the issue of timeliness of the motion is governed by section 242B of the Act and not by the general regulations regarding motions found at 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.2, 3.23, and 242.22 (1997). 4

Given our holding in this case, we need not address whether the respondent has satisfied the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.

Deportation proceedings involve the potential deprivation of a significant liberty interest and must be conducted according to the principles of fundamental fairness and substantial justice. See Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 34-35 (1982); Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970); Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 154 (1945) (stating that deportation “visits a great hardship on the individual. . . . Meticulous care must be exercised lest the procedure by which he is deprived of that liberty not meet the essential standards of fairness.”); see also INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 449 (1987); Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580 (1952); Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. 276, 284 (1922).

2

Let there be no mistake that, although we may not rule on he constitutionality of the statute we administer, the Board is authorized and expected to take due process considerations into account and to construe the statute to achieve a constitutional reading of its provisions. See, e.g., Matter of G-, 20 I&N Dec. 764, 780 (BIA 1993) (requiring administrative proceedings to conform to “basic notions of fundamental fairness”) (citing Hariasides v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580 (1952)); Matter of Hernandez-Puente, 20 I&N Dec. 335, 339 (BIA 1991)(recognizing our authority to enforce an alien’s procedural rights through determinations affecting deportability, discretionary relief, or other benefits under the Act); Matter of Silva, 16 I&N Dec. 26, 30 (BIA 1976) (exercising authority to adopt a construction of the statute that would ensure equal treatment of similarly situated aliens); see also Yeung v. INS, 76 F.3d 337 (11th Cir. 1995); cf. Matter of Cenatice, 16 I&N Dec. 162 (BIA 1977) (stating that the Board does not rule upon the constitutionality of the statutes we apply in our adjudications).

3

The right to appear is an essential liberty interest that may attach in the civil context. See, e.g., Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682 (1979) (extending the right to an oral hearing to social security overpayment recoupment proceedings); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973) (implying the right to be present in probation revocation proceedings); Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972) (applying the right to be present in a parole revocation hearing); Specht v. Patterson, 386 U.S. 605 (1967) (upholding the right to be present in commitment proceedings).

4

While section 242B of the Act contains specific provisions allowing an Immigration Judge to conduct a deportation proceeding in absentia, it did not repeal or replace the “reasonable” opportunity to be present found in section 242(b). See Sharma v. INS, supra, at 548.

5

Subsequent interpretations of Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., supra, that do not require receipt of notice are inapplicable here, as the statute specifically provides for rescission where the respondent demonstrates that he did not receive notice for purposes of a motion to rescind under section 242(b)(c)(3)(B). Cf. United States v. Perez-Valdera, 899 F. Supp. 181, 184 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (noting that receipt was not required); cf. also United States v. Estrada-Trochez, 66 F.3d 773, 735 (5th Cir. 1995) (finding that section 242(b) was satisfied by a 1987 notice sent by first-class mail that was returned because the alien provided no forwarding address).

6

In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), we required the respondent to demonstrate -- over and above malfeasance or nonfeasance on the merits -- the terms of his agreement with his attorney, that he notified the attorney of his complaint, and that he filed a grievance with the state licensing entity or provided an explanation for not doing so (“Lozada test”). In the instant case, the former attorney acknowledged the breach of her agreement to effectively represent the respondent by notifying him of his hearing date and her failure to properly represent him by filing a motion to reopen that either established that he did not receive actual notice due to ineffective assistance of counsel or alleged exceptional circumstances within the statutory deadline. Unlike dissenting Chairman Paul W. Schmidt, I find these admissions not only constitute compliance with the first two prongs of the “Lozada test” but satisfy the third prong’s “explanation” alternative in lieu of filing a bar complaint.

7

Ineffective assistance of counsel that has prevented hearing the merits of a case altogether has been treated differently from ineffective assistance of counsel that resulted, rather, in poor presentation of a case or a disastrous strategy. Cf. Magallanes- Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931 (9th Cir. 1986); see also Thorsteinsson v. INS, 724 F.2d 1365 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1205 (1984)(rejecting an ineffective assistance claim when the attorney had made an informed, strategic decision in litigation).

8

Although I view the difference in wording as a clear indication of Congress’ intent to insure that a respondent is not deported in absentia when he did not receive notice of his hearings, I note, in addition, that the Ninth Circuit has cautioned that the meaning given to words in a statute must comport with legislative intent. See United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 975 F.2d 1396, 1400 (9th Cir. 1992), rev’d on other grounds, 511 U.S. 350 (1994) (stating that courts should not “make a fetish of construing statutes in a literal fashion,” but should see their role as “that of perceptive diviner of congressional intent”) (citing United States v. Monia, 317 U.S. 424, 431 (1943) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (“The notion that because the words of a statute are plain, its meaning is also plain, is merely pernicious oversimplification.”)); see also United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U.S. 235, 242 (1989) (finding that the plain meaning of an unambiguous provision controlling, except in the “•rare cases (in which) the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters”’ (quoting Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U.S. 564, 571 (1982))).

9

Notwithstanding our decision in Matter of Lozada, supra, the touchstone of fairness in relation to counsel is not whether one has complied technically with the three-prong “Lozada test,” but whether one has been deprived of due process. See Committee of Central American Refugees v. INS, 795 F.2d 1434, 1439 (9th Cir. 1986) (citing Vides-Vides v. INS, 783 F.2d 1463, 1469-70 (9th Cir. 1986)). Therefore, the “Lozada test” is, or should be, no more than a guideline or mechanism to facilitate consideration of valid claims involving the denial of due process resulting from ineffective assistance of counsel. When the mechanism fails to facilitate, but instead swallows, the objective, the mechanism must be deemed faulty and itself ineffective.

1

I note that as a result of recently proposed changes in the rules relating to attorney discipline in proceedings before the Executive Office for Immigration Review (“EOIR”), it is possible that in the future there will be more effective means of dealing with the problem of ineffective assistance of counsel in the immigration context. See 63 Fed. Reg. 2901, 2906 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 3.52(k)(proposed Jan. 20, 1998)). Under the proposed regulations, disciplinary investigations would be conducted by the EOIR General Counsel either in conjunction with, or independent of, action by a State bar and without involvement by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Claims that are found to have merit upon investigation would be prosecuted before a Disciplinary Committee appointed by the Deputy Attorney General. This should solve, at least to a large extent, the problem of collusive claims of ineffective assistance by counsel that concerned the Board in Matter of Rivera, supra. While I do not suggest that isolated instances of negligence or error on the part of counsel should be a basis for discipline, attorneys who repeatedly fail to properly and competently represent the interests of their clients, or who file false admissions of negligence or incompetence to secure strategic benefits for their clients, should not be practicing before EOIR.

MATHON, Board Member:
 
In a decision dated February 21, 1995, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent deported in absentia after he failed to appear for a scheduled deportation hearing. On April 13, 1995, the Immigration Judge denied a motion to reopen to rescind the outstanding deportation order. The Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision on March 7, 1996. The respondent filed this motion to reopen with the Board on February 21, 1997. The motion will be denied.
  
I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The respondent is a 34-year-old native and citizen of Burkina-Faso. He entered the United States on October 30, 1991, as an alien in transit with authorization to remain in the country until October 31, 1991. On July 26, 1994, the Immigration and Naturalization Service served the respondent with an Order to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing (Form I-221), charging *141 him with being deportable from the United States under section 241(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B) (1994), as an alien who remained in the United States for a time longer than permitted.
 
By means of a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney (Form EOIR-28) dated August 13, 1994, an attorney notified the Immigration Court of his intent to represent the respondent in deportation proceedings. In a letter dated November 16, 1994, the respondent was notified that he was scheduled to appear before an Immigration Judge on February 21, 1995, at an Immigration Court in Atlanta, Georgia. The letter was mailed to the respondent’s attorney of record on November 16, 1994. An individual at the respondent’s attorney’s office signed for the notice on November 21, 1994.
 
Neither the respondent nor his attorney of record appeared for the scheduled deportation hearing. The Immigration Judge conducted the proceedings in absentia and, in a decision dated February 21, 1995, ordered the respondent deported pursuant to section 242B(c)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(1) (1994). The respondent claims that he was not informed by his attorney of record of the scheduled deportation hearing until he received the subsequent deportation order.
 
**2 On April 7, 1995, the respondent, who continued to be represented by his former attorney, filed a motion to reopen to rescind the outstanding deportation order. See section 242B(c)(3) of the Act. The respondent asserted that he did not receive notice of the February 21, 1995, hearing. On April 13, 1995, the Immigration Judge denied the motion. He concluded that no substantial grounds had been advanced to warrant rescission of the outstanding order. The respondent appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision to the Board on May 22, 1995. On March 7, 1996, we dismissed the appeal, concluding that the respondent received proper notice of the February 21, 1995, hearing in that it was sent to and received by the respondent’s attorney of record. See section 242B(a)(2) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a) (1995).
 
On February 21, 1997, the respondent, represented by new counsel, filed a motion to reopen with the Board and requested a stay of deportation.1 The motion seeks to reopen the proceedings to rescind the outstanding deportation order pursuant to section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act. In particular, the respondent argues that he failed to attend the scheduled February 21, 1995, deportation hearing on account of an exceptional circumstance, namely the ineffective assistance of his counsel. The evidence of record indicates that on February 11, 1997, the respondent filed a grievance against his former attorney with the State Bar of Georgia.2 In addition, he has submitted *142 an affidavit in support of the motion and informed his former attorney of the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent argues that he merits reopening of the proceedings on account of exceptional circumstances, notwithstanding the fact that the motion was filed 721 days after the Immigration Judge’s issuance of the deportation order pursuant to section 242B of the Act. He concedes that there is a time limit, 180 days after the Immigration Judge’s order, for the filing of motions to reopen under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act, and he acknowledges that his motion filed on February 21, 1997, does not meet the statutory time limit. However, he contends that the time bar should not apply in this case, given that the failure to timely file was due to the ineffective assistance of his former counsel.
  
II. ISSUE PRESENTED
 
The issue before the Board is whether a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes an exception to the 180-day time limit under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act.
  
III. APPLICABLE LAW
 
Section 242B(c)(3) of the Act provides for the rescission of a deportation order entered in absentia under section 242B(c)(1) as follows:
 
RESCISSION OF ORDER.--Such an order may be rescinded only--
(A) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (f)(2)), or
 
**3 (B) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with subsection (a)(2) or the alien demonstrates that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien.
 
Section 242B(c)(3) of the Act (emphasis added).
 
The use of the term “only” makes this the exclusive method for rescinding an in absentia deportation order entered pursuant to section 242B(c) of the Act. See Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644, 646 (BIA 1993).
  
IV. ANALYSIS
 
Section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act expressly requires that a motion to *143 reopen to rescind an in absentia deportation order based on exceptional circumstances be filed within 180 days of the order. The record in this case reflects that the order of deportation was entered on February 21, 1995. The respondent did not file his current motion until February 21, 1997, well beyond the 180 days allotted by the statute. Therefore, we find that the respondent is statutorily barred from rescinding the deportation order under section 242B(c) (3)(A).3
 
The respondent concedes that the time limit for filing a motion to reopen based upon exceptional circumstances has elapsed. However, he essentially urges us to create an exception to the 180-day rule where the failure to timely file a motion to reopen is due to the ineffective assistance of counsel and where the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), have been satisfied. We decline to do so.
 
It is well settled that the language of the statute is the starting point of statutory construction. See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 431 (1987). The plain meaning of the words used in the statute as a whole has been held to be the paramount index of congressional intent. Id. at 431; Matter of W-F-, Interim Decision 3288, at 6 (BIA 1996). Moreover, it is assumed that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used. INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 189 (1984); see also Matter of Shaar, Interim Decision 3290 (BIA 1996), aff’d, Shaar v. INS, 141 F.3d 953 (9th Cir. 1998).
 
The language of section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act regarding the time limit within which a motion to reopen must be filed is clear on its face and unambiguous. It provides that an in absentia deportation order entered pursuant to section 242B(c) may be rescinded “only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances.” Section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act (emphasis added). The statute contains no exceptions to this time bar. Where the statutory language is clear, “that is the end of the matter” and we “must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984); see also Matter of W-F-, supra, at 5-6. Accordingly, we are bound to uphold and apply the plain meaning of the statute as written. Had Congress intended to provide for an exception to the 180-day time limit based on the ineffective assistance of counsel, it could have done so.
 
**4 *144 This conclusion is consistent with the overall statutory scheme of section 242B of the Act. Section 242B was added to the Act by section 545(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978, 5061-65 (enacted Nov. 29, 1990). See generally Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, supra. It was enacted to provide stricter and more comprehensive deportation procedures, particularly for in absentia hearings, to ensure that proceedings are brought to a conclusion with meaningful consequences. See Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3246, at 7 (BIA 1995); Matter of Villalba, Interim Decision 3310, at 5 n.2 (BIA 1997); 136 Cong. Rec. S17, 109 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1990); 136 Cong. Rec. H8630 (daily ed. Oct. 2, 1990). The 180-day time limit reflects congressional intent to bring finality to in absentia deportation proceedings.
 
Therefore, given that the statute is explicit in its requirement that such a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days of the in absentia order, and considering the legislative history of section 242B of the Act, we conclude that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not an exception to the 180-day time limit imposed by section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act.4 Notwithstanding the respondent’s apparent compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, the motion will be denied.
  
V. CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly, we find the respondent is statutorily barred from rescinding the order of deportation based on “exceptional circumstances” pursuant to section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act, regardless of whether he can demonstrate that his failure to timely file the motion is attributable to the ineffective assistance of his counsel.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s grant of a stay of deportation pending adjudication of the motion is vacated.
Vice Chairman Mary Maguire Dunne and Board Member Lori L. Scialabba did not participate in the decision in this case.
CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION: Lory D. Rosenberg, Board Member
 
*145 I concur in part and dissent in part.
 
Our obligation to enforce the terms of section 242B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b (1994), does not require us to enforce section 242B and its subsections narrowly and restrictively, and it does not preclude us from enforcing section 242B in its entirety, and consistently with the United States Constitution, guided by fairness and compassion. As I indicated in Matter of Lei, Interim Decision 3356 (BIA 1998), I agree with the majority that we are bound to uphold the statute as written. I cannot agree, however, that the majority opinion interprets section 242B in a manner that can be viewed as true to the terms of the statute, consonant with constitutional due process protections, or consistent with agency precedent and authority.
 
The respondent in this case is an individual who was represented by an attorney in deportation proceedings before the Immigration Judge. Under these circumstances, written notice was given by certified mail to the respondent’s attorney. See section 242B(a)(2) of the Act. The written notice was sent by the Immigration Court only to his attorney, and was not sent by either the Immigration Court or the respondent’s attorney to the respondent.
 
**5 When neither the respondent nor his attorney appeared before the Immigration Judge on the date and at the time stated in the notice, the Immigration Judge conducted a deportation hearing in absentia. Apparently the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent had been provided notice of the hearing as required by section 242B(a)(2) and found that the Immigration and Naturalization Service had met its burden of proof under section 242B(c)(1) of the Act.
 
The respondent, however, did not receive notice as required by section 242B(c)(3)(B). The verb used in section 242B(a)(2) -- to “give” -- and the verb used in section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Act -- to “receive” -- are distinct. See also section 242B(a)(1) of the Act (using the verb to “give”). Similarly, the verb used in section 242B(c)(1) -- to “provide” -- is different from the verb to “receive” as used in section 242B(c)(3)(B).
 
Although section 242B(c)(1) of the Act states in relevant part that an alien who does not attend a proceeding “after written notice required under subsection (a)(2) has been provided to the alien or the alien’s counsel of record” shall be ordered deported in absentia “if the Service establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided,” section 242B(c)(3)(B) states that an in absentia order may be rescinded, “at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with subsection (a)(2).” (Emphasis added.) Thus, according to section 242B(c)(3)(B), notice that was “provided” to the respondent’s attorney but not to the respondent (that otherwise might satisfy the requirements of section 242B(a)(2) for purposes of showing that notice was “given”), does not preclude rescission and reopening when, as here, the respondent did not receive notice. See section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the *146 Act; compare section 242B(a)(2) of the Act with section 242B (c)(1).
 
Represented by the same counsel, he filed an initial motion, within 2 months of issuance of the in absentia order of deportation by the Immigration Judge, in which he contended that he never received notice of the hearing. See section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Act, which imposes no time limit on motions to reopen filed on the basis of lack of notice or improper notice. When that motion was denied by the Immigration Judge, despite the statutory language of section 242B(c)(3)(B), the respondent appealed to the Board. Although the respondent appears to have been represented by former counsel throughout at least the first 180 days following issuance of the in absentia deportation order, no motion to reopen claiming exceptional circumstances was filed by former counsel under section 242B(c)(3)(A). When the Board denied the respondent’s appeal from the original motion to reopen 10 months later, the statutory deadline had long passed.
 
Several months after that, represented by new counsel, the respondent filed a new motion, claiming that ineffective assistance of his former counsel constituted exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear at the deportation hearing. The essence of his claim of ineffective assistance is that he was never notified of the deportation hearing by his former attorney or any other source, and did not learn of the fact the hearing had been scheduled and taken place, until he received a notice of the in absentia order of deportation issued by the Immigration Judge. He provided an affidavit in support of the motion, informed his former attorney of making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against him, and provided evidence that he had filed a grievance against that counsel with the State Bar of Georgia.
 
**6 We have held that when an attorney fails to provide proper notice to his client, such nonfeasance or misfeasance may amount to ineffective assistance of counsel, which constitutes “exceptional circumstances” within the meaning of section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Act. See Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3284 (BIA 1996) (finding that a respondent who did not receive proper notice from his attorney and who has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), has established ineffective assistance of counsel based on “exceptional circumstances”). In Matter of Lozada, we required the respondent to demonstrate -- over and above malfeasance or nonfeasance on the merits -- the terms of his agreement with his attorney, that he notified the attorney of his complaint, and that he filed a grievance with the State licensing entity or provided an explanation for not doing so (“Lozada test”).
 
In the instant case, the “Lozada test” appears to have been satisfied. Furthermore, the Board has ruled that reopening of deportation proceedings is required when, because of ineffective assistance of counsel, “the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.” Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638. Moreover, even if notice to the respondent’s attorney is presumed *147 to be adequate notice to him, the facts of this case rebut such a presumption. Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3246 (BIA 1995) (recognizing that provision of notice might be challenged on the basis that notice was never received); see also Matter of N-K- & V-S-, Interim Decision 3312 (BIA 1997) (finding that failure to provide proper notice constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel on the merits).
 
Our holding in Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3284, -- that circumstances in which improper notice from counsel frustrated a respondent’s opportunity to appear before the Immigration Judge, demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel and constituted exceptional circumstances -- does not foreclose rescission “at any time” when failure to appear is based on lack of receipt of notice due to ineffective counsel. Similarly, the decision does not prohibit rescission when ineffective assistance of counsel results in counsel’s failure to file a timely motion under section 242B(c)(3)(A). Compare section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act (involving exceptional circumstances, requiring filing of such a motion within 180 days), with section 242B(c)(3)(B) (involving failure of proper notice, including no time limitation for filing such a motion).
 
The propriety of an in absentia deportation order in response to the respondent’s failure to appear must be decided within the framework of all of the statutory provisions pertaining to issuance of in absentia deportation orders and related constitutional due process protections.1 In my view, the majority errs in concluding that, under the terms of the statute, we do not have any latitude to find that an attorney’s failure to notify the respondent to appear, followed by his failure to file a timely motion asserting exceptional circumstances attributable to such conduct, constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel amounting to a prejudicial violation of due process.
 
**7 The circuit courts of appeals that have addressed rescission of a deportation order under section 242B of the Act have indicated a concern with an unnecessarily narrow, literal reading of the statutory in absentia provisions such as that adopted by the majority. See, e.g., Romero-Morales v. INS, 25 F.3d 125 (2d Cir. 1994) (finding “disquieting” the Immigration Judge’s “failure to examine the particulars of the case before him” in the context of “either issuing the in absentia ruling or denying the motion to reopen”). I see no reason why, under such circumstances, we may not rescind the *148 deportation order and reopen the proceedings. See Baires v. INS, 856 F.2d 89, 91 (9th Cir. 1988) (holding that administrative expediency must give way to protection of fundamental rights); Matter of W-F-, Interim Decision 3288 (BIA 1996) (Rosenberg, concurring and dissenting).
 
The right to be present at one’s deportation hearing arises from the statutory language and from due process considerations that involve issues of personal liberty.2 It is difficult to imagine what could be more prejudicial to a respondent charged with being deportable from the United States than denial of an opportunity to be present at his deportation hearing where he might provide any defenses to the charges against him, or advance any claims he may have for relief from deportation. See Iris Gomez, The Consequences of Nonappearance: Interpreting New Section 242B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 30 San Diego L. Rev. 75, 107-08 (1993); section 242(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b) (1994);3 see also Maldonado-Perez v. INS, 865 F.2d 328, 333 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (holding that the Act implements constitutional requirements of a fair hearing).
 
I believe that we should allow the respondent’s motion based on his attorney’s failure to inform him of the time and place of the hearing, which constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel, as well as under a plain reading of the statutory language of section 242B(c)(3)(B) that requires that he receive notice. I note that we have statutory authority to grant such a motion “at any time.” Section 242B(c)(B)(3) of the Act. In addition, I believe that counsel’s failure to file a motion to reopen based on “exceptional circumstances” within the 180-day deadline constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel, and that such interference with the respondent’s fundamental due process right to be provided a hearing prior to being deported requires us either to construe section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the statute not to foreclose rescission under such circumstances, or warrants our exercising our authority to achieve an equitable outcome.
 
I therefore dissent for each of the reasons set forth in the entirety of my dissenting opinion in Matter of Lei, supra, pertaining to the statutory construction of section 242B(3)(c)(B), which authorizes rescission when the *149 respondent has not received notice of a hearing at which an in absentia order was entered, and to a reasonable reading of section 242B(c)(3)(A), which authorizes rescission of an in absentia order for “exceptional circumstances.” I stress that the later reading is appropriate, despite the fact that the subsection requires that a motion must be filed within 180 days of the in absentia order challenged -- when ineffective assistance of counsel results in the failure to file a timely motion under that section.
 
**8 In addition, the respondent in this case appears to be an asylum applicant, whose application for protection from alleged persecution was referred by an asylum officer and is contained in the record. Consequently, even notwithstanding my disagreement with the majority on the issue of whether we may rescind the in absentia order issued in the respondent’s case, I cannot agree that the respondent’s appeal is properly resolved by simply affirming the order of deportation. As I have discussed at length in my dissenting opinions in Matter of J-P-, Interim Decision 3348 (BIA 1998), Matter of S-M-, Interim Decision 3349 (BIA 1998), and Matter of B-A-S-, Interim Decision 3350 (BIA 1998), according to the statute, the respondent retains the right to a hearing before an Immigration Judge on the merits of his asylum application. I therefore dissent for the reasons stated in those opinions as well.
 
Consequently, I find the opinion of the majority to be erroneous and an abuse of discretion on two bases. First, I read the statute as requiring us to rescind the deportation order because the respondent, who did not receive notice in accordance with section 242B(a)(2) of the Act, was denied proper and meaningful notice due to ineffective assistance of counsel, and because I find that ineffective assistance of counsel constituted exceptional circumstances that were responsible for the respondent’s failure to file a timely motion to reopen on those grounds. Second, at a minimum, assuming there was a legitimate statutory basis to decline to rescind the in absentia order finding deportability, the statute requires us, nonetheless, to entertain the respondent’s application for asylum.
CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION: John W. Guendelsberger, Board Member
 
I concur in part and dissent in part.
 
I concur with the majority’s analysis regarding the respondent’s inability to rescind the in absentia order of deportation under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3)(A) (1994), given the expiration of the 180-day time limitation for such motions. However, I would examine the respondent’s eligibility to rescind under section 242B(c)(3)(B), for cases involving lack of notice. Although the applicability of this alternate avenue for rescission is not explicitly raised on appeal, the issue should be addressed, in light of the *150 respondent’s assertion that he never received notice of his hearing.
 
Section 242B(a)(2)(A) of the Act, which governs the method of providing notice in deportation proceedings, states in relevant part:
Written notice shall be given in person to the alien (or, if personal service is not practicable, written notice shall be given by certified mail to the alien or to the alien’s counsel of record, if any) . . . .
 
 
 
 
 
Section 242B(c)(1) of the Act sets forth the circumstances under which a hearing may be held in absentia:
Consequences of failure to appear.--
 
 
(1) In general.--Any alien who, after written notice required under subsection (a)(2) has been provided to the alien or the alien’s counsel of record, does not attend a proceeding under section 242, shall be ordered deported under section 242(b)(1) in absentia if the Service establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien is deportable. In the instant case, the respondent’s attorney was given written notice of the respondent’s hearing by certified mail, in accordance with subsection (a)(2). Thus, the Immigration Judge properly held a hearing in absentia under subsection (c)(1), as notice was provided to “the alien’s counsel of record.” However, the fact that notice is provided in accordance with section 242B(a)(2) of the Act does not conclusively resolve the issue of sufficiency of notice for the purposes of reopening to rescind under section 242B(c)(3)(B). That subsection provides, in pertinent part:
**9 Rescission of order.--Such an order may be rescinded only--
. . .
(B) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with subsection (a)(2) . . . .
 
 
 
 
 
Notably, while subsection (c)(1) permits a hearing to be held in absentia where an alien fails to attend a proceeding “after written notice required under subsection (a)(2) has been provided to the alien or alien’s counsel” (emphasis added), section 242B(c)(3)(B) permits an alien to rescind such an order where the alien can demonstrate that “the alien did not receive notice in accordance with subsection (a)(2)” (emphasis added). The difference in the statutory language between these two sections is significant. Congress could have used the same wording in both sections, but instead focused only upon receipt by the alien for purposes of rescission. This variance in the statutory language demonstrates that Congress intended for the alien, as opposed to the alien’s counsel as agent, to have notice of his or her hearing for purposes of rescinding under section 242B(c)(3)(B). See, e.g., *151 INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 432 (1987) (applying the principle of statutory construction that where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposefully in the disparate inclusion or exclusion). Therefore, even where the respondent’s attorney is served with notice in accordance with subsection (a)(2), which is sufficient notice under subsection (c)(1) for purposes of conducting a hearing in absentia, the alien should still be permitted to rescind the order under subsection (c)(3)(B) upon demonstrating that “the alien did not receive notice.”
 
Our decision in Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3246 (BIA 1995), involved a similar issue of lack of notice under section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Act. In that case, the alien was served notice in accordance with section 242B(a)(2), by certified mail to the alien’s last known address. The certified mail return receipt was returned as unclaimed, following notices of certified mail provided to the alien by the United States Postal Service. The Board held that where service of a notice of hearing in deportation proceedings is sent by certified mail through the United States Postal Service, and there is proof of attempted delivery and notification of certified mail, a strong presumption of effective service arises which may be overcome by the affirmative defense of nondelivery or improper delivery by the Postal Service. The alien asserted that he never received the notice of hearing or the notices of certified mail from the Postal Service, and we remanded the case to allow the alien an opportunity to demonstrate nondelivery or improper delivery of the notice, through no fault of the alien. Id. at 17.
 
Although Matter of Grijalva, supra, involved service of written notice directly upon the alien, a similar opportunity to demonstrate nondelivery should be available in the situation presented in the instant case, in which written notice is mailed to the alien’s attorney. Specifically, the alien should be allowed to demonstrate that his or her counsel failed to convey the notice of hearing to the alien.
 
**10 Furthermore, this approach is not inconsistent with the regulation regarding representative capacity. That regulation, found at 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a) (1997), provides in pertinent part that “(w)henever a person is required . . . to give or be given notice . . . such notice . . . shall be given by or to . . . the attorney or representative of record, or the person himself if unrepresented.” This provision merely indicates to whom service is to be made and does not address whether such service is sufficient notice to the alien to preclude rescission under section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Act.
 
Thus, while the Immigration Judge properly held an in absentia hearing, in light of the evidence that notice in accordance with subsection (a)(2) had been provided to the respondent’s counsel, the respondent should not be precluded under subsection (c)(3)(B) from reopening and rescinding if he can establish lack of actual notice by showing that his attorney did not, *152 in fact, communicate the notice of hearing to him, and that he therefore did not “receive notice” of his hearing. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (prescribing standards for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel). Section 242B(c)(3) does not specify a 180-day limit upon such a motion if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive notice of the hearing.
 
**11 DISSENTING OPINION: Paul W. Schmidt, Chairman
It is undisputed on this record that the respondent’s former attorney failed to give him actual notice of his deportation hearing and that counsel himself failed to attend that hearing. Under these circumstances, I believe that there are due process difficulties with concluding that notice to counsel constituted notice to this respondent.
 
I believe that when Congress specified under section 242B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b (1994), that notice to an alien’s counsel is sufficient, it was based on the reasonable assumption that counsel would carry out his or her professional obligation to make reasonable efforts to notify the client of the hearing date. In other words, Congress believed that notice to counsel would constitute effective notice to the alien. In this case, prior counsel failed to carry out his duty.
 
Although I am aware that another panel of this Board reached the opposite conclusion on March 7, 1996, I would rescind the order of deportation in this case on the ground that the respondent never received effective notice of his deportation hearing. The time limits cited by the majority do not apply to rescission based on lack of notice. Section 242(B)(3)(B) of the Act. Therefore, this case should be reopened for lack of notice under section 242B.
 
Although not necessary for me to resolve this case, I also disagree with the majority’s reliance on the 180-day rule as an absolute bar to reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent’s Lozada claim is that his former counsel’s mishandling of this case not only caused him to miss his deportation hearing but also precluded him from meeting the 180-day deadline. Assuming that this is true, failing to reopen this case would raise serious constitutional due process issues. Cf. Romano-Morales v. INS, 25 F.3d 125 (2d Cir. 1994) (cautioning against overly mechanical application of section 242B). To avoid those serious issues, I would reopen this case sua sponte under 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(a) (1997) even if I found that legal notice had been provided. See Matter of J-J-, Interim Decision 3323 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board may reopen on its own motion in exceptional circumstances).
 
For the foregoing reasons, I dissent from the decision to deny the respondent’s motion.
*153 DISSENTING OPINION: Gustavo D. Villageliu, Board Member
 
I respectfully join the dissents of Chairman Paul W. Schmidt and Board Members Lory D. Rosenberg and John W. Guendelsberger. I agree with their conclusion that section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3)(B) (1994), allows rescission of an in absentia deportation order at any time if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive notice of his deportation hearing due to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Footnotes

The Board granted the respondent’s stay request on November 4, 1997.

In a letter dated May 23, 1997, the State Bar of Georgia informed the respondent that his former attorney’s conduct did not fall within its jurisdiction and that it contemplated no further action in the matter.

The issue of timeliness of the motion to reopen is governed by section 242B of the Act and not by the general regulations regarding motions found at 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.2, 3.23, and 242.22 (1997). Accordingly, we need not determine whether the motion was timely filed pursuant to the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 3.2.

We note that there is no statutory time limit for a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia deportation order based on a claim that the alien did not receive proper notice of the scheduled hearing. See section 242B(c)(3)(B) of the Act.

Deportation proceedings involve the potential deprivation of a significant liberty interest and must be conducted according to the principles of fundamental fairness and substantial justice. See Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 34-35 (1982); Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970); Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 154 (1945) (stating that deportation “visits a great hardship on the individual. . . . Meticulous care must be exercised lest the procedure by which he is deprived of that liberty not meet the essential standards of fairness.”); see also INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 449 (1987); Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580 (1952); Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. 276, 284 (1922).

The right to appear is an essential liberty interest that may attach in the civil context. See, e.g., Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682 (1979) (extending the right to an oral hearing to social security overpayment recoupment proceedings); Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972) (applying the right to be present in a parole revocation hearing); Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973) (implying the right to be present in probation revocation proceedings); Specht v. Patterson, 386 U.S. 605 (1967) (upholding the right to be present in commitment proceedings).

While section 242B of the Act contains specific provisions allowing an Immigration Judge to conduct a deportation proceeding in absentia, it did not repeal or replace the “reasonable” opportunity to be present found in section 242(b).

IN RE N-K- & V-S-, Applicant
File A70 077 344/345 - Los Angeles
Decided March 13, 1997
**1 *879 A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel can, if the applicant meets the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), form the basis of a successful motion to reopen exclusion proceedings where the applicant was ordered excluded in an in absentia hearing.

James S. Stolley, Jr.
Assistant District Counsel
Before: Board Panel: SCHMIDT, Chairman; HURWITZ, ROSENBERG, Board Members.
 
ROSENBERG, Board Member:
 
In separate decisions dated March 14, 1991, entered following individual hearings held in absentia, the Immigration Judge found the applicants excludable, determined that they had failed to establish eligibility for any form of discretionary relief, and ordered them excluded from the United States. No appeal was taken.
  
I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
On June 10, 1991, the applicants, through newly-retained counsel, moved to reopen their exclusion proceedings in order to explain their absence at the prior proceeding, which they claimed to have had no notice of, and to request a change of venue from Los Angeles to San Francisco. In a decision dated June 28, 1991, the Immigration Judge denied the motion, deciding that the notice of hearing served on their “attorney of record” was legally adequate notice to the applicants.
 
The applicants appealed the Immigration Judge’s denial of their motion to reopen and moved for a change of venue. On appeal, they explained that their prior counsel has been retained for the limited purpose of arranging their release from Immigration and Naturalization Service custody, and that there was no agreement that he would represent them at any future proceeding. *880 They were unaware that the attorney had been given notice of the March 14th hearing, that such a hearing took place, and that he had appeared on their behalf at that proceeding.
 
By decision dated September 13, 1994, we dismissed the appeal and denied the motion to change venue. We decided that the applicants’ stated reason for their failure to appear, that their attorney had not notified them of the date of hearing, was not a reasonable explanation for their failure to attend the hearing.
 
We noted that to the extent the applicants were claiming that they received ineffective assistance of counsel from their prior attorney, they had not followed the procedures for supporting such a claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). As the Immigration Judge noted in his decision, notice to an attorney of record constitutes notice to the alien. See 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a) (1991). We pointed out that there is no “limited” appearance of counsel in immigration proceedings, and that because the attorney never withdrew from the case, he remained the applicants’ attorney of record. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). Furthermore, we found the applicants’ contention that they were only represented by former counsel through the time of release from Service custody “unpersuasive, if not incredible,” noting that the attorney actually appeared at the hearing claiming to be the applicants’ representative.
  
II. MOTION TO REOPEN BASED ON INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL
 
**2 By motion dated September 10, 1996, and received on September 25, 1996, the applicants moved the Board to reopen their exclusion proceedings and to stay deportation pending our decision on their motion to reopen. When the basis for a motion to reopen is that the Immigration Judge erroneously held an in absentia hearing, the alien must establish reasonable cause for his or her absence from the proceedings. Section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b) (1994); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988); Matter of Nafi, 19 I&N Dec. 430 (BIA 1987). If the alien shows reasonable cause for his failure to appear, the motion will be granted; if he does not, the motion will be denied. Matter of Ruiz, 20 I&N Dec. 91 (BIA 1989).
 
The applicants’ motion to reopen before the Board is based on an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. “Ineffective assistance of counsel in a deportation proceeding is a denial of due process only if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case. One must show, moreover, that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance.” Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638 (citations omitted); see also Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3284 (BIA 1996) (noting that ineffective assistance of counsel can amount to “exceptional *881 circumstances” within the meaning of section 242B(f)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(f)(2) (1994)); cf. Matter of Rivera, Interim Decision 3296 (BIA 1996) (finding that the alien had failed to show exceptional circumstances where she did not meet all of the Lozada requirements).
 
In Lozada, we laid out the requirements an applicant must meet in order to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. First, the motion should be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved applicant attesting to the relevant facts. Second, before the allegation is presented to the Board, the former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond. Any subsequent response from counsel, or report of counsel’s failure or refusal to respond should be submitted with the motion. Finally, if it is asserted that prior counsel’s handling of the case involved a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, the motion should reflect “whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not.” Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639; see also Matter of Rivera, supra.
 
The applicants in this case have met the “high standard” we announced in Lozada. First, the female applicant provided a detailed declaration supporting her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. This declaration states that the applicants never received notice of the hearing from former counsel or anyone else. It also states their understanding that the attorney was retained for the limited purpose of arranging their release from custody and that there was no agreement that he would represent them at any future proceeding.1
 
**3 Second, prior counsel was informed by letter of the allegations against him, and his reply indicates that he believed that his role as attorney was “limited to handling the exclusion matter up to the release from INS custody, and did not extend to asylum or any other subsequent work.”2 Finally, the record reflects that the female applicant filed a complaint against former counsel with the State Bar of California.
 
For these reasons, we conclude that the applicants have satisfied the requirements of Matter of Lozada. We find that the record supports their contention that they were prejudiced by the actions of their former counsel and were prevented from presenting their case. This was a reasonable cause for their failure to appear, and we therefore grant the motion to reopen. The motion to stay deportation until we decide the motion to reopen is now moot.
 
*882 ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted and the case is remanded to the Immigration Court in San Francisco, California, for further proceedings.

The Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before Office of the Immigration Judge (Form EOIR-28) filed by former counsel indicates that it was “submitted in connection with bond-out only, and expires in 14 days.”

The attorney’s stated belief that he only represented the applicants for a certain phase of their case does not explain why he appeared at their hearing without them and presented himself as their representative. Nor does it reflect an understanding of the well-settled principle that there is no “limited” appearance of counsel in an immigration proceeding. See Matter of Velasquez, supra. However, it does support a finding that the assistance the applicants received from him was ineffective.

Chief Appellate Counsel
Before: Board En Banc: DUNNE, Vice Chairman; VACCA, HEILMAN, HOLMES, HURWITZ, FILPPU, COLE, and MATHON, Board Members. Dissenting Opinion: SCHMIDT, Chairman, joined by VILLAGELIU, ROSENBERG, and GUENDELSBERGER , Board Members.
 
FILPPU, Board Member:
 
The respondent has timely appealed an Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen her deportation proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia. The appeal will be dismissed.
  
I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On October 6, 1994, the respondent appeared at a deportation hearing in Los Fresnos, Texas. At that hearing, the respondent, through Texas counsel, conceded deportability and filed an application for asylum. The respondent also requested a change of venue to Arlington, Virginia, which the Immigration Judge granted. The motion for a change of venue states that it was accompanied by a notice of appearance (Form EOIR-28) and identified an attorney licensed by and practicing in a jurisdiction in the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area who would be assuming representation of the *600 respondent (“former counsel”). The respondent’s Texas counsel was also permitted to withdraw at that time.
 
On October 13, 1994, a notice of a January 10, 1995, hearing was sent by the Immigration Court in Arlington, Virginia, to former counsel. Neither the respondent nor her former counsel appeared at the January 10, 1995, hearing, and, accordingly, the Immigration Judge issued a decision in absentia.
 
The respondent, through new and current counsel, filed a motion to reopen on January 18, 1995. That motion was denied by an Immigration Judge during a hearing on April 11, 1995. A written decision of the April 11, 1995, ruling was issued, with some modifications, on June 19, 1995.
 
The respondent timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s April 11, 1995, decision. On October 11, 1995, the respondent, after having received a “bag and baggage” notice of deportation for October 13, 1995, requested an emergency stay of deportation from this Board pending a decision on the instant appeal. In an October 12, 1995, order, this Board granted the respondent’s emergency stay request. In Matter of Rivera, Interim Decision 3266 (BIA 1996), this Board vacated the October 12, 1995, order and held that the automatic stay of deportation associated with the filing of a motion to reopen an in absentia hearing pursuant to section 242B(c)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3) (1994), continues during the pendency of an appeal from the denial of such a motion.
  
II. UNDERLYING APPEAL
 
**2 We now consider the respondent’s underlying appeal. A deportation order issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242B(c) of the Act may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because she did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because she was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of her own. Section 242B(c)(3) of the Act. See Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 242B(f)(2) of the Act.
 
The respondent, through new counsel, contended in her motion to reopen that she had never received notice of the January 10, 1995, hearing. She stated that, although former counsel reportedly sent her a letter on November 3, 1994, informing her of the January 10, 1995, hearing, the respondent never received that letter and was thus unaware of the January 10, 1995, hearing.
 
The motion to reopen was accompanied by a declaration from the respondent. In this declaration, the respondent recounts her numerous unsuccessful attempts to speak with former counsel after she arrived in Maryland from Texas. She states that she believes she did not receive her former counsel’s *601 letter due to either postal error or an error of inadvertence by former counsel. The respondent states that she does not intend to file a complaint against former counsel.
 
An affidavit from former counsel also accompanied the respondent’s motion to reopen. In the affidavit, former counsel states that a letter was sent to the respondent advising her of the hearing date and also informing her that the attorney would not be able to represent her on January 10, 1995, due to a heavy caseload and a shortage of time. We note that it does not appear from the record that former counsel informed the Immigration Court in Arlington, Virginia, of an intention to formally withdraw as the respondent’s counsel. Indeed, the Immigration Judge, in her June 19, 1995, written decision, states that “(t)here has been no excuse shown for the absence of counsel of record from the hearing.”
 
Former counsel further states in the affidavit that it was not until January 12, 1995, that it was discovered in a conversation with the respondent that she had never received the letter that former counsel had sent to her on November 3, 1994. The attorney states that, at that time, the respondent confirmed that the address to which former counsel had mailed the November 3, 1994, letter was the respondent’s correct address.
 
The respondent further argued in her motion to reopen that, because of her inability to communicate with her former counsel and because of her nonreceipt of the November 3, 1994, letter, her failure to appear at the January 10, 1995, hearing was due to exceptional circumstances beyond her control.
 
**3 On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in concluding that the respondent had been properly served with the notice of hearing because there was no showing that personal service on either the respondent or her counsel was not practicable. The respondent also contends that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that the failure of the respondent’s former counsel to adequately communicate the date of the hearing to her did not constitute exceptional circumstances beyond her control. The respondent argues that, given the evidence showing her interest in having her case prosecuted, it is unreasonable to conclude that she would ignore a letter advising her of a hearing on the matter.
  
III. CONCLUSIONS
  
A. Proper Notice
 
We first address the respondent’s contention that she had not been properly served with the notice of hearing because there was no showing that personal service on either the respondent or her counsel was not practicable. This claim is raised only in the attachment to the respondent’s notice of appeal and is not further developed in her brief.
 
*602 According to 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a) (1996), whenever a person in immigration proceedings is required to be given notice, such notice will be given to the attorney or representative of record, if the person is represented. See sections 242B(a)(2), (c)(1) of the Act. The record reflects that notice of the January 10, 1995, hearing was sent to the respondent’s former counsel by certified mail, return receipt requested, on October 13, 1994. A return receipt, signed by someone at former counsel’s address, is also included in the record. Former counsel has also attested to receiving notice of the January 10, 1995, hearing. Thus, service of the notice of hearing on former counsel was service in accordance with sections 242B(a)(2) and (c)(1) of the Act and with 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a). See Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3246 (BIA 1995) (hereinafter Grijalva 1995).
 
Further, we note that in Grijalva 1995, supra, this Board held that, pursuant to section 242B(a)(2)(A) of the Act, neither the Executive Office for Immigration Review nor the Immigration Court is required to show that “in person” service was not “practicable” before permitting service of the notice of hearing by certified mail. Id. at 13. We therefore disagree with the respondent’s contention concerning service of the notice of the hearing.
 
We will not now, however, consider whether there may be circumstances where counsel’s performance is so inadequate that notice to the attorney under 8 C.F.R. §292.5(a) should not be deemed to be notice to the alien. This question has not been raised by the respondent nor briefed by the parties.
  
B. Exceptional Circumstances and Lozada
 
We next address the respondent’s contention that her alleged inability to communicate with her former counsel combined with her alleged nonreceipt of the November 3, 1994, letter constituted exceptional circumstances beyond her control.
 
**4 This Board, in another decision bearing the name Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3284 (BIA 1996) (hereinafter Grijalva 1996), recently held that an alien alleging ineffective assistance of counsel who satisfied the requirements set out by this Board in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), had established exceptional circumstances for purposes of section 242B(c)(3) of the Act. In Grijalva 1996, the respondent alleged that, on the morning of the scheduled hearing date, an employee of his former counsel called the respondent and erroneously informed him that a continuance had been granted and that he should not appear at the Immigration Court. The Board found “the level of incompetence involved in this case establishes that the respondent’s absence was the result of exceptional circumstances within the meaning of section 242B(f)(2) of the Act.” Id. at 4.
 
In Matter of Lozada, supra, we held that claims alleging ineffective assistance of counsel require
 
*603 (1) that the motion to reopen be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard;
 
(2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond and;
 
(3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not.
 
We determined that the above three requirements for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are necessary in order to have a basis for assessing the substantial number of such claims which come before the Board.1
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the circuit within which this case arises, disagreed with our application of the Lozada “bar complaint” requirement in the context of a case involving an adolescent alien where the court found no reason to disbelieve the claim of attorney incompetence and did not see how the filing of such a complaint would aid in the disposition of the immigration aspects of the case. Figeroa v. United States INS, 886 F.2d 76 (4th Cir. 1989). It is not clear whether the Fourth Circuit fully understood the basis for our Lozada requirements, as Lozada itself is not mentioned in Figeroa. Moreover, the respondent’s case is distinguishable, as explained later.
 
In the instant case, we note that the respondent appears to have fulfilled the second of the Lozada requirements. While it is questionable whether she has met the first requirement, we find that the respondent has not complied with the third requirement, that of filing a complaint against former counsel or adequately explaining why a complaint against former counsel has not been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. In the declaration accompanying her motion to reopen, the respondent asserts that she does not wish to file a complaint against former counsel. The respondent, in her declaration, states that “if any error was made in this case it was a postal error or an error of inadvertence by (former counsel).” As explained below, we find this to be an inadequate explanation under Lozada.
 
**5 The governing regulations allow any attorney who is a member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of any State, possession, territory, Commonwealth, or the District of Columbia to practice before Immigration *604 Judges and the Board. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1.1(f), 292.1(a)(1) (1996). Regulations do exist for the disciplining of attorneys appearing before Immigration Judges. See 8 C.F.R. § 292.3 (1996). But those regulations, in their current form, are not intended to be a comprehensive set of rules governing the practice of law in the immigration field and, indeed, are not as broad as the American Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct (1995), for example. Moreover, there is no expeditious way for this Board to deal with the more routine attorney-related problems that periodically arise. Instead, for attorneys who may practice before us simply by virtue of their admission into a state bar or the bar of another recognized jurisdiction, we rely on the disciplinary process of the relevant jurisdiction’s bar as the first, and ordinarily the fastest, means of identifying and correcting possible misconduct.
 
In this way, this Board’s interest in having a method of monitoring those attorneys who practice before us is addressed. However, this process, as set out in Matter of Lozada, supra, also necessitates the cooperation of the party alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. As we stated in Matter of Lozada, this process not only serves to deter meritless claims of ineffective assistance of counsel but also highlights the standards which should be expected of attorneys who represent aliens in immigration proceedings. Id. at 639. It also serves to protect against collusion between alien and counsel in which “ineffective” assistance is tolerated, and goes unchallenged by an alien before disciplinary authorities, because it results in a benefit to the alien in that delay can be a desired end, in itself, in immigration proceedings. See INS v. Rios-Pineda, 471 U.S. 444 (1985); Reid v. INS, 766 F.2d 113 (3d Cir. 1985); Cheng Fan Kwok v. INS, 381 F.2d 542 (3d Cir. 1967), aff’d, 392 U.S. 206 (1968).
 
When adjudicating an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, this Board relies to a great extent on the documents submitted in support of that claim, such as affidavits and declarations. An evidentiary hearing before an Immigration Judge focusing on the prior attorney-client relationship and on the specifics of prior counsel’s behavior cannot always be avoided. Nevertheless, such hearings are an added burden on both the parties and the Immigration Court, and they rarely assist in resolving the merits of the substantive immigration law issues presented by a particular case. Consequently, we prefer to make final determinations of ineffective assistance of counsel claims on the documentary submissions alone, where possible.
 
We also recognize that affidavits prepared by litigants may not always present a full picture of the circumstances bearing on issues raised by the affidavits. In addition, the Immigration and Naturalization Service will frequently lack independent information regarding the details of an attorney-client relationship, which can involve privileged communications. In this context, the Lozada requirements substantially reduce the pres sure for routinely requiring a hearing to test the reliability of the affidavits. The filing of a complaint with the attorney’s licensing body serves to increase our confidence in the strength of the claim being made. By greatly lessening the chances of collusion and of meritless claims being brought forward for the *605 purposes of delay, the Lozada requirements more readily enable us to act on such motions without routinely requiring evidentiary hearings on matters, such as counsel’s performance, that are collateral to the merits of substantive immigration law determinations.
 
**6 In the context of the instant case, we recognize that the existence of problems in communication between an attorney and a client, as a question of past fact, is not dependent on the filing of a complaint with a state bar or a bar from another recognized jurisdiction. It is thus possible to resolve the ineffective assistance of counsel claim either on the documentary submissions or after an evidentiary hearing, without requiring the filing of a bar complaint. However, the same is true of any ineffective assistance of counsel claim, as the Fourth Circuit’s decision in Figeroa indicates. Figeroa v. United States INS, supra, at 79. Thus, while this Board, under various circumstances, accepts showings of ineffective assistance of counsel as due process violations that permit aliens to obtain new hearings, in no situation will the filing of a bar complaint change the past events that are alleged to amount to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The requirement of a bar complaint, however, serves important purposes in such cases. First, it increases our confidence in the validity of the particular claim. Second, it reduces the likelihood that an evidentiary hearing will be needed. Third, it serves our long-term interests in policing the immigration bar. And, fourth the requirement of filing a complaint, or adequately explaining why such a complaint has not been filed, protects against possible collusion between counsel and the alien client. Moreover, we consider the filing of such a complaint, or reasonably explaining why such was not done, to be a relatively small inconvenience for an alien who asks that he or she be given a new hearing in a system that is already stretched in terms of its adjudicatory resources. We also note that our Lozada rule can no longer be considered new. It has been in existence for over 8 years, well before the events giving rise to this case.2
  
*606 C. The Application of Lozada to This Case
 
The respondent, perhaps aware of our requirement in Matter of Lozada, supra, states in her declaration that she does not intend to file a complaint against her former counsel. The respondent states that “if any error was made in this case it was a postal error or an error of inadvertence by (former counsel).” However, we consider the respondent’s explanation for not filing a complaint against former counsel to be inadequate and to minimize significantly the questions raised by the attorney’s apparent conduct.
 
For example, former counsel states in the attached affidavit that a signed but blank notice of appearance, Form EOIR-28, was sent to Texas counsel. This at least leaves open the possibility that her former counsel was unaware of the respondent’s actual identity at the time the change of venue motion was filed in Texas. That motion for a change of venue, however, states in paragraph 4, that “Respondent has retained the services of (former counsel) . . . , whose E(OIR)-28 is being filed, to represent her . . . .”3 The record raises questions as to the nature of the attorney-client relationship involved here.
 
**7 Most importantly, the respondent’s former counsel, based on the evidence of record, apparently failed (1) to ensure that the respondent received notice of her hearing; (2) to confirm whether the respondent had been able to secure new counsel and, if not, to move for a continuance to enable the respondent to obtain new counsel; (3) to move the Immigration Court for withdrawal; and 4) to show up at the hearing absent permission to withdraw.
 
The manner in which former counsel assumed and executed representation of the respondent seems to reflect on the seriousness of the attorney’s commitment to represent the respondent. The record before us is equally consistent with there being some impropriety committed upon the Immigration Court, with or without the respondent’s knowledge, as it is with a host of other scenarios, including innocent but perhaps negligent behavior by a busy attorney.
 
The record also raises some questions as to the respondent’s understanding of what may have been transpiring. We note that former counsel’s affidavit states that, along with the November 3, 1994, letter, the respondent was *607 sent a list of attorneys who might be able to represent her. We also note that the respondent, in paragraph 6 of her declaration, refers to having received a list of attorneys. However, it is unclear when or how the respondent, who alleges she did not receive her former counsel’s November 3, 1994, letter, received the list of attorneys. It is cases such as this, where we are unable to discern clearly what has occurred and the culpability, if any, that stems from such conduct, which reinforce the need for the process we set out in Matter of Lozada, supra.4
 
It may well be true that an inability to communicate with former counsel combined with nonreceipt of the November 3, 1994, letter might constitute exceptional circumstances beyond the respondent’s control. However, absent the respondent’s full compliance with the Lozada requirements, the degree of confidence we have in her individual claim is lessened to the point where we decline to grant the motion. The unanswered questions regarding the attorney-client relationship and the respondent’s understanding of her responsibilities distinguish this from Figeroa v. Unites States INS, supra.
 
In addition, absent compliance with Lozada, the value of the bar complaint as a tool evidencing a lack of collusion and preventing future episodes of this sort is completely eliminated, and it is unclear whether the Fourth Circuit understood the multiple purposes behind our Lozada rule at the time of its decision in Figeroa.
 
We thus conclude that the respondent, who has failed to satisfy all of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim set out in Matter of Lozada, supra, has not satisfactorily established a case for reopening under the exceptional circumstances provision of section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act.5
 
*608 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
**8 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
**9 DISSENTING OPINION: Paul W. Schmidt, Chairman, in which Gustavo D. Villageliu, Lory D. Rosenberg, and John Guendelsberger, Board Members, joined.
I respectfully dissent.
 
The moving papers establish that the respondent made reasonable efforts to contact her former attorney, including at least 10 phone calls and an unsuccessful office visit. Her former attorney acknowledges in an affidavit that counsel was aware that the respondent was trying to reach her by phone and in person concerning the Immigration Court date.
 
Notwithstanding this knowledge, the respondent’s former counsel used regular mail, as opposed to registered mail, a messenger, or courier service, to send the respondent’s hearing notice. Further, former counsel did not personally follow up by telephone to ensure that the critically important notice of hearing date was received by the respondent.
 
In Matter of Grijalva, Interim Decision 3284 (BIA 1996), we recently found that ineffective assistance of counsel constituted an “exceptional circumstance” justifying reopening of deportation proceedings under section 242B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b (1994). The primary difference between this case and Grijalva is that the respondent in Grijalva filed a complaint with the state bar association in accordance with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
However, I do not need a Lozada motion or a state bar complaint to find that ineffective assistance has occurred here. The respondent’s affidavit and that of former counsel are sufficient to establish that former counsel’s duties to the respondent were not properly discharged. There is no hint of collusion between former counsel and the respondent. Under these circumstances, I see no basis for making the filing of a state bar complaint the determinative factor as to whether exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien have been established.
 
I agree with my colleagues in the majority that, in many instances, the Lozada requirements serve to expedite and facilitate the process for adjudicating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, in this particular case, I do not find that the filing of a state bar complaint will contribute materially to resolving either the factual or the legal issues in the respondent’s case.
 
*609 I had read Lozada as setting forth a practical rule that did not eliminate our overall discretion to grant a motion to reopen when the circumstances and fairness required it. I now understand the majority to state that Lozada is a prerequisite in every case raising ineffective assistance of counsel as an issue. The majority’s absolute rule goes too far.
 
I also share the majority’s concern with substandard practice by attorneys appearing before the Executive Office for Immigration Review (“EOIR”). I regret that the current regulations, set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 292.3 (1996), have proved largely ineffective to deal with lapses in professionalism. I also trust that the disciplinary regulations will be revised in the future to overcome those shortcomings. Nevertheless, I question the wisdom and the fairness of making the respondent in this case bear the major brunt of enforcing professional practice standards before EOIR. See Figeroa v. United States INS, 886 F.2d 76, 79 (4th Cir. 1989) (questioning the requirement that an alien file a bar complaint to raise ineffective assistance of counsel before this Board).
 
**10 In summary, the respondent has satisfactorily established that her former counsel failed to give her notice of the time and place of her hearing, notwithstanding the respondent’s persistent attempts to get such information from former counsel. The breakdown in attorney-client communications, alluded to by the majority, was on the side of the attorney. Under these circumstances, the respondent’s failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances beyond her control. Cf. Matter of Grijalva, supra. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the decision to dismiss the respondent’s appeal.

We note that in Grijalva 1996, supra, this Board stated that an alien is not required to show prejudice in order to rescind an order of deportation entered following a hearing conducted in absentia under section 242B(c)(3) of the Act. See Grijalva 1996, supra, at 3 n.2. The statute does not require a showing of prejudice to obtain relief from an in absentia order. Thus, the “prejudice” component of our Lozada rule has not been extended to this context.

The dissent does not argue that we should overrule Lozada. Nor does it contend that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be assessed outside the statutory structure of section 242B in cases where the claim relates to an in absentia order. Instead, it would find ineffective assistance of counsel without the need for a bar complaint. It thus seems that the dissent would make the filing of such a complaint contingent on the degree of the evidence of collusion and effectiveness of former counsel that is presented in each case.
The application of Lozada on the selective, special-case basis implied by the dissent is undesirable. Such an approach would provide little guidance to the public as to when the filing of a bar complaint was deemed critical to the success of a motion based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. This uncertainty would extend to our adjudication process and would likely increase the number of submissions required in those cases where the filing of the bar complaint was ultimately deemed critical. Moreover, clear evidence of collusion is almost by definition difficult to come by. The requirements in Lozada in part arise from the view that an alien’s unexplained reluctance to pursue disciplinary action, while simultaneously arguing that counsel’s representation was so inadequate as to warrant reopening of immigration proceedings, in itself raises questions regarding the issue of collusion.
In addition, the dissent’s approach would also eliminate the collateral benefits of Lozada in terms of correcting inappropriate or unethical professional conduct, except in those cases where we could discern likely collusion or other grounds for denial. But if collusion could be detected from the record in a particular case, it is unclear how the filing of a bar complaint would help an alien obtain reopening in any event. In cases of obvious collusion, moreover, the likelihood of a bar complaint actually being filed would appear to be reduced, if for no other reason than continued efforts at concealment of the collusion.

We note that this notice of appearance, Form EOIR-28, is not actually contained in the record. It is not clear whether the Form EOIR-28 appearance form has been misplaced or simply was not attached to the change of venue motion.

We do not share the dissent’s view that there is “no hint of collusion” in this case. We do not see evidence from which a finding of collusion can be made. But there are inadequately answered questions, especially in relation to the role former counsel was expected to play in the overall handling of the respondent’s case. Circumstances that remain unexplained are the respondent’s receipt of the list of other attorneys, the exact nature of the “attorney-client” relationship that existed between the respondent and her former counsel, and the respondent’s understanding, as the result of her relationship with Texas counsel, of what actually could be expected of former counsel in relation to the representation of the respondent in the Arlington, Virginia, Immigration Court. Moreover, none of these concerns are in any way dispelled by the respondent’s seeming tolerance of former counsel’s conduct, which is reflected in the inadequate explanation for the failure to file a complaint with disciplinary authorities. Former counsel’s conduct, as characterized by the respondent, cannot simply be explained away by postal error or “inadvertence.”

We note that the respondent’s motion met the 180-day time limit for “exceptional circumstances” motions imposed by section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act. We need not now address whether the respondent may satisfy the remainder of the statutory requirements by virtue of information submitted outside the 180-day period. In other words, our ruling does not foreclose the respondent’s filing of a supplemental motion that satisfies all the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. However, we caution that any such motion filed by the respondent must comply with the requirements for motions filed at the Board. See 61 Fed. Reg. 18,900-10 (1996) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. pts. 1, 3, 103, 208, 212, 242, 246). We also express no view on whether such a supplemental submission may succeed as either an “exceptional circumstances” claim under section 242B(c)(3)(A) or a “lack of notice” claim under section 242B(c)(3)(B).

General Attorney
Before: Board Panel: HOLMES, HURWITZ, and VILLAGELIU, Board Members.
 
HURWITZ, Board Member:
 
In a decision dated April 2, 1993, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the deportation proceedings. The respondent has appealed that decision. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico who entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident on January 20, 1964. On April 2, 1991, the Immigration and Naturalization Service issued an Order to Show Cause charging the respondent with deportability under section 241(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(B)(i) (Supp. III 1991), as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation. The respondent was scheduled to appear for a hearing before an Immigration Judge on March 1, 1993, for consideration of his previously filed application for relief from deportation. At that time, he failed to appear. Because no reason was evident for the respondent’s absence, the Immigration Judge conducted the hearing in absentia pursuant to section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b (Supp. V 1993), found the respondent deportable as charged, determined that *473 he had abandoned any potential applications for relief, and ordered him deported from the United States.
 
On March 15, 1993, the respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge. See generally Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I & N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). The respondent argued that his motion should be granted because his failure to appear was due to the misdirection of his counsel, who was unable to attend the hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen on April 2, 1993, remarking that respondent’s counsel had “engaged in tactics of delay which could only be characterized as contumacious.”
 
On appeal, the respondent, through new counsel, argues that the proceedings should be reopened and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge based upon the ineffective assistance of his former counsel.1 According to the respondent, on the morning of the scheduled hearing, an employee of his prior attorney called to inform him that there had been a continuance and that he should not appear at the Immigration Court. The respondent later learned that the hearing had been conducted in absentia, that his application for relief had been deemed abandoned, and that he had been ordered deported. In support of his appeal, the respondent has submitted evidence that he filed a complaint against his former counsel with the State Bar of Arizona, and that he informed counsel of the allegations made against him. The respondent also has included an affidavit from his former counsel which corroborates the respondent’s account of events.
 
**2 An order issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242B(c) of the Act may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear owing to exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 242B(c)(3) of the Act; see also Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, supra. The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 242B(f)(2) of the Act.2
 
Upon review of the record, we find that the respondent has established sufficient grounds for reopening these proceedings. Initially, we find that he has properly shown ineffective assistance by his former counsel. In Matter of Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir.1988), the *474 Board held that a motion to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires that (1) the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not.
 
We find that the respondent has satisfied all three of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. The motion is supported by a statement which sets forth the actions taken by the respondent’s former counsel, includes evidence that counsel was informed of the allegations leveled against him and was provided an opportunity to respond, and includes a copy of a complaint filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities informing them of the respondent’s allegations. The respondent’s contentions are corroborated by the sworn affidavit of his prior attorney, as well as by the transcript of proceedings in this case. Therefore, we conclude that the respondent has made a convincing claim of ineffective assistance by his former counsel.
 
Furthermore, the level of incompetence involved in this case establishes that the respondent’s absence was the result of exceptional circumstances within the meaning of section 242B(f)(2) of the Act. We point out that the respondent, who had no reason not to rely on his counsel at this juncture, was blatantly misled regarding his need to appear at the scheduled hearing. Counsel’s inappropriate behavior was recognized by the Immigration Judge in his decision. We consider also that the respondent is a longtime resident of the United States who had a pending application for relief before the Immigration Judge. This suggests that he would have appeared but for the misrepresentations by his former counsel.
 
**3 Under these circumstances, we conclude that the respondent has established that his failure to appear for the scheduled deportation hearing was the result of exceptional circumstances, as required by section 242B(c)(3) of the Act. Accordingly, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

We note that the respondent has alleged ineffective assistance by both of his former attorneys, Mr. William Redondo and Mr. Mark Redondo. However, we will consider only the allegations concerning Mr. Mark Redondo, as he was the respondent’s counsel of record at the time of the March 1, 1993, in absentia hearing and subsequent motion to reopen.

In Deportation Proceedings
A-31025184
Decided by Board April 13, 1988
**1 *637 (1) A motion to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not.

On March 13, 1985, an immigration judge found the respondent deportable as charged on the basis of his concessions at the hearing under section 241(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(4) (1982), as an alien who was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within 5 years of entry and *638 was sentenced to confinement for 1 year or more, denied his applications for relief under section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1982), and for voluntary departure under section 244(e) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254(e) (1982), and ordered him deported to the Dominican Republic. That same day, the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal (Form I–290A), indicating that he would be filing a separate written brief or statement in support of his appeal. No such brief or statement was forthcoming. On July 8, 1986, over a year after the immigration judge had entered his decision in the case, the Board summarily dismissed the appeal, noting that the respondent had in no meaningful manner identified the claimed error in the immigration judge’s comprehensive decision of March 13, 1985.
 
On January 20, 1987, the respondent, through present counsel,1 filed a motion to reopen the proceedings, alleging (1) that prior counsel’s failure to submit a written brief or statement explaining the basis for appeal constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and (2) that the immigration judge erred as a matter of law and discretion in deciding the case. The respondent also filed a petition for review of the Board’s decision with the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. The court has stayed action on the petition for review pending the Board’s resolution of the motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
**2 Any right a respondent in deportation proceedings may have to counsel is grounded in the fifth amendment guarantee of due process. Magallanes—Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931 (9th Cir. 1986); Paul v. INS, 521 F.2d 194 (5th Cir. 1975). Ineffective assistance of counsel in a deportation proceeding is a denial of due process only if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case. Ramirez—Durazo v. INS, 794 F.2d 491 (9th Cir. 1986); Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015 (9th Cir. 1985); see also Magallanes—Damian v. INS, supra (alien must show not merely ineffective assistance of counsel, but assistance which is so ineffective as to have impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing in violation of the fifth amendment due process clause). One must show, moreover, that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance. Mohsseni Behbahani v. INS, 796 F.2d 249 (9th Cir. 1986). See generally Matter of Santos, Interim Decision 2969 (BIA 1984).
 
The Government maintains that the fact that prior counsel did not submit a brief does not in itself amount to deprivation of due process. We agree.
 
*639 Failure to specify reasons for an appeal is grounds for summary dismissal under 8 C.F.R. § 3.1(d)(1–a)(i) (1988). See generally Matter of Valencia, Interim Decision 3006 (BIA 1986). It would be anomalous to hold that the same action or, more accurately, inaction that gives rise to a summary dismissal of an appeal could, without more, serve as the basis of a motion to reopen. To allow such anomaly would permit an alien to circumvent at will the appeals process, with its regulatory time constraints, by the simple expedient of failing to properly pursue his appeal rights, then claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. Litigants are generally bound by the conduct of their attorneys, absent egregious circumstances. LeBlanc v. INS, 715 F.2d 685 (1st Cir. 1983). No such egregious circumstances have been established in this case.
 
A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent attesting to the relevant facts. In the case before us, that affidavit should include a statement that sets forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken on appeal and what counsel did or did not represent to the respondent in this regard. Furthermore, before allegations of ineffective assistance of former counsel are presented to the Board, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond. Any subsequent response from counsel, or report of counsel’s failure or refusal to respond, should be submitted with the motion. Finally, if it is asserted that prior counsel’s handling of the case involved a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, the motion should reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not.
 
**3 The high standard announced here is necessary if we are to have a basis for assessing the substantial number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that come before the Board. Where essential information is lacking, it is impossible to evaluate the substance of such claim. In the instant case, for example, the respondent has not alleged, let alone established, that former counsel ever agreed to prepare a brief on appeal or was engaged to undertake the task. Then, too, the potential for abuse is apparent where no mechanism exists for allowing former counsel, whose integrity or competence is being impugned, to present his version of events if he so chooses, thereby discouraging baseless allegations. The requirement that disciplinary authorities be notified of breaches of professional conduct not only serves to deter meritless claims of ineffective representation but also highlights the standards which should be expected of attorneys who represent persons in immigration proceedings, *640 the outcome of which may, and often does, have enormous significance for the person.
 
The respondent’s motion is wholly insufficient in light of the foregoing guidelines. We note, moreover, that no prejudice was shown to have resulted from prior counsel’s failure to or decision not to file a brief in support of the appeal. The respondent received a full and fair hearing at which he was given every opportunity to present his case. We do not find, and the respondent does not allege, any inadequacy in the quality of prior counsel’s representation at the hearing. The immigration judge considered and properly evaluated all the evidence presented, and his conclusions that the respondent did not merit a grant of section 212(c) relief as a matter of discretion and that he was ineligible for voluntary departure as a matter of law are supported by the record.
 
The allegations of error ascribed to the immigration judge in the respondent’s motion are unfounded. Contrary to present counsel’s contention, it is clear from the transcript of hearing and the immigration judge’s decision that the immigration judge was well aware that the respondent committed the offense of obtaining money under false pretenses several years prior to his conviction of that offense. And contrary to counsel’s contention, the immigration judge correctly determined that the respondent was not eligible for a grant of voluntary departure. By the express terms of section 244(e) of the Act, an alien deportable under section 241(a)(4) of the Act is ineligible for voluntary departure unless he qualifies under the provisions of section 244(a)(2) of the Act, which in the case of criminal offenders requires, inter alia, that the alien have been physically present in this country, and a person of good moral character, for a continuous period of not less than 10 years following his conviction. See generally Matter of P—, 6 I&N Dec. 788 (BIA 1955). The 10-year period is measured from the date of conviction, not the date the offense was committed, since it is the conviction, not the commission of the offense, that renders the alien deportable. Id. Since 10 years from the date of the conviction constituting the ground of deportation have not yet elapsed, the respondent is unable to demonstrate statutory eligibility for voluntary departure.
 
**4 The respondent has shown no basis for reopening or reconsideration. His motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.
