IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Surajudeen Agbaje, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated May 27, 2010. During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to reopen pursuant to Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4) (2011). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed, and the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on July 8, 2009, pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). (I.J. (May 27, 2010)). The respondent filed a motion to reopen the record of proceeding and to rescind the in absentia removal order on December 31, 2009 (I.J. (May 27, 2010)). The respondent explained in the motion to reopen that she failed to appear on July 8, 2009, because her attorney erroneously informed her that the date for the hearing was July 9, 2009 (I.J. (May 27, 2010); (I.J. (March 1, 2010)).
 
The Immigration Judge observed that the explanation constituted a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. (May 27, 2010); (I.J. (March 1, 2010)). See Aris v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 599 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 798, 801-02 (5th Cir. 2007); Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 937-38 (9th Cir. 2003); Twum v. INS, 411 F.3d 54, 59 n. 4 (2d Cir. 2005)) (“We now join our sister circuits in concluding that, under BIA precedent applicable to the pre-1996 version of the INA as well as its current iteration, a lawyer’s inaccurate advice to his client concerning an immigration hearing date can constitute ‘exceptional circumstances’ excusing the alien’s failure to appear at a deportation hearing [] and meriting the reopening of an in absentia deportation order [].”). However, the respondent did not support this claim with any evidence, such as an affidavit, or otherwise comply with the customary requirements for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (I.J. (May 27, 2010); (I.J. (March 1, 2010)). See also Zheng v. United States Dept. Of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46-47 (2d Cir. 2005). Furthermore, the respondent provided no explanation for the delay between the entry of the in absentia order and the filing of the motion to reopen (I.J. (March 1, 2010)). Hence, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen (I.J. (May 27, 2010); (I.J. (March 1, 2010)).
 
*2 On March 30, 2010, the respondent moved for reconsideration, and the Department of Homeland Security opposed the motion on April 8, 2010 (I.J. (May 27, 2010)). The respondent supported the motion for reconsideration with an affidavit in which she corroborated the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in the underlying motion to reopen. However, the respondent, who was (and continues to be) represented by the attorney against whom the claim of ineffectiveness has been made, did not otherwise attempt to comply with the standards set out in Matter of Lozada, supra (I.J. (May 27, 2010)). Accordingly, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion for reconsideration, and this appeal ensued.
 
In the Notice of Appeal, the respondent contends that her failure to comply with Matter of Lozada, supra, is “not a fatal error.” We disagree. First, the respondent is appealing from the denial of the motion for reconsideration, not from the denial of the underlying motion to reopen. Motions for reconsideration constitute a request to reassess the evidence already in the record of proceeding, not a request for consideration of new, previously unavailable evidence. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57-58 (BIA 2006) (“A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based on the previous factual record, as opposed to a motion to reopen, which seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence.” (citations omitted)).
 
Second, the respondent is incorrect in dismissing the importance of the substantive and procedural requirements for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. For example, the bar complaint requirement plays an important role in deterring meritless claims and policing the private immigration bar. See Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 604 (BIA 1996) (recognizing that “for attorneys who may practice before us simply by virtue of their admission into a state bar or the bar of another recognized jurisdiction, we rely on the disciplinary process of the relevant jurisdiction’s bar as the first, and ordinarily the fastest, means of identifying and correcting possible misconduct.”); see also Aris v. Mukasey, supra, at 596 (“With disturbing frequency, this Court encounters evidence of ineffective representation by attorneys retained by immigrants seeking legal status in this country.”); Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498, 504 (7th Cir. 2001) (“The deficiencies of the immigration bar are well known, see, e.g., Lara v. Trominski, supra, 216 F.3d at 497; Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, supra, 206 F.3d at 1335; Katy Motiey, “Ethical Violations by Immigration Attorneys: Who Should Be Sanctioning?” 5 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 675, 676-80 (1992); cf. Hilary Sheard, “Ethical Issues in Immigration Proceedings,” 9 Geo. Immigration L.J. 719, 739 (1995), and a major purpose of the third rule is to enlist the clients of that bar in efforts to raise its ethical standards by putting pressure on immigrants to report to the appropriate disciplinary authorities conspicuous failures of the immigration bar to comply with minimum norms of professional conduct.”); Lara v. Trominski, supra, at 496 (citing Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639) (recognizing that Lozada’s “requirement regarding disciplinary allegations served both to deter meritless claims and to aid in policing the immigration bar.”); but see Lo v. Ashcroft, supra.
 
*3 Turning to the respondent’s motion to reopen, which we treat as a request for remand, the motion is both time-barred, as it was filed on September 29, 2010, which is more than 90-days after the entry of the in absentia order of removal on July 8, 2009, and number-barred, as the respondent has already filed one motion to reopen and one motion for reconsideration. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (BIA 2000) (“Because the Immigration Judge entered a final administrative decision and declined to disturb the decision’s finality, the respondent’s motion to remand must be subject to the time and number limits for motions to reopen; otherwise, we will have allowed the respondent to circumvent the regulatory limits set forth in 8 C.F.R. § [100]3.2.”); see also Ramirez-Alejandre v. Ashcroft, 320 F.3d 858, 874 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc). And, as noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent is not presently eligible for adjustment of status, as there is no immigrant visa immediately available to her (I.J. (March 1, 2010)). See Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 790 (BIA 2009) (“A visa is immediately available when the alien’s priority date is earlier than the date for the specified preference category shown on the current Visa Bulletin.” (citations omitted)); see also Osorio v. Mayorkas, 656 F.3d 954, 956-57 (9th Cir. 2011).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed, and the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
John D. Shin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 In a November 13, 2009, decision, this Board dismissed the respondents’ appeal of an Immigration Judge’s denial of their request to continue proceedings.1 On August 20, 2010, and again on July 6, 2011, we denied the respondents’ motions to reopen. The respondents, who are natives and citizens of South Korea, have continued to press for additional time so that one of them might obtain an approved employment-based visa petition. They have now moved that we reconsider our last decision. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider shall specify the errors of fact or law in the previous order and shall be supported with pertinent authority. Section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
The respondents offer no direct challenge with the finding in our previous decision that their last motion to reopen was numerically barred and untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (only one motion to reopen maybe filed, and it must be filed within a 90-day deadline). They continue to assert, however, that alleged ineffective assistance of counsel-which might toll such limitations on the filing a motion to reopen-caused the visa petition submitted on behalf of one of the co-respondents to be revoked. We previously considered and rejected this argument. We noted in our last decision that the respondents had not met the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) to file such a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and had not shown that they were prejudiced by that former attorney’s conduct.
 
The prior attorney, Steven Y. Lee, was reportedly handling the visa petition filed by Sun Ok Hwang’s now-former employer on her behalf. We emphasize that the respondents have no standing to challenge the attorney’s work for that employer-client, whether involving a potential appeal or otherwise, as they could not retain the attorney themselves to secure the visa petition. Further, the respondents previously asserted that the attorney’s fraud conviction and disbarment related to other matters, and they submitted an affidavit from that attorney stating that the co-respondent’s visa petition was not tainted by any fraud. In so doing, they undercut their own claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, regardless of their relationship with this attorney (which they have not sufficiently specified) with respect to, perhaps, the filing of their adjustment of status application. As the respondents acknowledge, in light of the allegations of fraud surrounding that attorney in other matters, the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) provided the co-respondent’s former employer with an opportunity to prove the validity of the visa petition. It is undisputed that the employer chose not to do so, and that the visa petition was revoked in 2005, well before the Immigration Judge’s 2008 decision to deny a continuance. Thus, the respondents were not prejudiced by the former attorney’s actions, whatever agreement they may have had with him, as the employer decided not to pursue the visa petition. The respondents set forth no sufficient evidence of an agreement with the attorney which might show where he failed in any obligation to them.
 
*2 The respondent’s last motion to reopen provided no evidence that the respondents were any further along in their attempts for one or more of them to obtain an employment-based visa petition after the previous one was revoked over half a decade ago. As noted, that motion was numerically barred and untimely. Although another such visa petition had apparently been filed in 2009 on behalf of the lead respondent, it was conceded that that petition had been denied.2 Without a pending labor certification or pending visa petition, where the final order of removal had been entered in this case over 2 years ago, and where such evidence is provided after the numerical and time limitations for filing a motion to reopen, the respondents’ last motion did not provide a basis for reopening proceedings. See Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); see also Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009). As they have not identified a factual or legal error with the prior decision, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

The respondents previously provided evidence that one or more employers may have been considering over the years whether to pursue additional visa petition(s), and asserted through counsel that DHS’s online database (incorrectly) reflected that the former visa petition was still pending. None of this, or any other evidence submitted, overcame the time and numerical bars to their last motion to reopen.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(K), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(K)]

APPLICATION: Reconsideration, reopening
 
This case was last before us on September 6, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision finding him removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. On October 5, 2011, the respondent filed what he titled a motion to reconsider. To the extent that the respondent’s motion is a motion to reconsider, it is timely. See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2) (stating that a motion to reconsider “must be filed with the Board within 30 days after the mailing of the Board decision”). To the extent that the respondent’s motion is a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the motion also is timely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act (stating that motions to reopen “shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal”). The respondent’s motion, however, will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal also will be denied.
  
I. MOTION TO RECONSIDER
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of South Korea. In his motion, he argues that we erred in upholding the Immigration Judge’s finding that his conviction for conspiracy to use an interstate facility in aiding a racketeering enterprise constituted a conviction for an aggravated felony. The respondent contends that his offense does not qualify as an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(K)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(K)(i), because he could not have been convicted of owning, controlling, managing or supervising a prostitution business. The respondent maintains that the evidence shows that he was merely an employee who followed orders and that he did not own, control or supervise a prostitution business.1
 
The respondent also contends that the offense for which he was convicted is not categorically an aggravated felony, and he appears to claim that the modified categorical approach is not appropriate given the structure of the statute. See Respondent’s Motion for Reconsideration at 4. The respondent then goes on to contend that, if the modified categorical approach is applied, the examination of the record of conviction should include consideration of the variations in the sentences imposed on the three defendants in the criminal proceeding. The respondent claims that the difference in the sentences shows that the defendants had different levels of participation in the crime and that he had the smallest role. In addition, the respondent claims that his acquittal on the money laundering charge in his criminal case should be considered, and he maintains that this Board overlooked this fact in reviewing his case.
 
*2 We do not find that the respondent has identified any errors of law or fact in our prior ruling in his case. See section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57 (BIA 2006). The respondent raised his claim that his offense does not qualify as an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(K)(i) of the Act in his brief on appeal, and we previously addressed this argument. We find no error in our prior conclusion that the record of conviction sufficiently supports a finding that the respondent is removable as charged. While the respondent maintains that the evidence shows that he was simply an employee rather than an owner or manager of a prostitution business, the issue in this proceeding is not what the evidence at his criminal trial showed but for what offense he was convicted. As we stated previously, the information in the superseding indictment and the judgement is sufficient to establish that he was convicted of conspiracy to commit acts that involved managing or supervising a prostitution business rather than simply conspiracy to commit acts involving the promotion of a prostitution business. Accordingly, we find no basis for reconsidering our prior decision upholding the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent is removable as charged.
 
In addition, we did not err in applying the modified categorical approach in analyzing the respondent’s offense. Unlike the statute at issue in Familia Rosario v. Holder, 655 F.3d 93 (7th Cir. 2011), a recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in a case involving the same portion of the aggravated felony definition, the statute at issue in the respondent’s case, 18 U.S.C. § 1952(a)(3), is divisible. Cf. Smalley v. Ashcroft, 354 F.3d 332, 336 (5th Cir. 2003) (finding 18 U.S.C. § 1952 to be divisible in the context of a determination as to whether a conviction under the statute qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude). Section 1952(a)(3) of Title 18 of the United States Code contains a list of disjunctive elements, some of which would make the offense an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(K)(i) of the Act and some of which would not. Accordingly, neither we nor the Immigration Judge erred in looking to the record of conviction in the respondent’s case to determine under which portion of the statute the respondent was convicted. See Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, 462 F.3d 456, 463-64 (5th Cir. 2006).
 
Moreover, the fact that the respondent was acquitted of the money laundering charge contained in count 2 of the superseding indictment in his criminal case has no bearing on whether his conviction for the offense described in count 1 of that indictment constitutes a conviction for an aggravated felony. We therefore find no error in our failure to mention the respondent’s acquittal on the other charge.
 
*3 Similarly, the fact that the other defendants in the respondent’s criminal trial received different sentences is not relevant to the determination as to whether the respondent was convicted of a crime that constitutes an aggravated felony. See Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, supra, at 463-4 and 468-9 (listing the limited set of documents that can be considered in applying the modified categorical approach and finding that this Board erred in considering sentencing factors or information, which does not simply define the charge and the defendant’s guilty plea, but, instead, frequently refers to facts neither alleged nor admitted in court). We therefore could not, and cannot, consider this information in determining whether the respondent is removable as charged, despite the respondent’s claims.
 
Based on the foregoing, we do not find any basis for reconsidering our prior decision upholding the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent is removable as charged. We therefore deny the respondent’s motion to the extent that the motion is a motion to reconsider.
  
II. MOTION TO REOPEN
 
In addition to his allegations regarding our ruling on his removability, the respondent claims in his motion that the time the Immigration Judge gave him to explore possible relief from removal was insufficient given the ineffective assistance of his former attorneys. The respondent argues that his former attorneys failed to interview him sufficiently to determine whether he was eligible for any form of relief and failed to research the issue sufficiently. The respondent claims that he was prejudiced by these errors because he is prima facie eligible for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status.2
 
To the extent that he is making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent’s motion constitutes a motion to reopen. The respondent, however, has not satisfied the procedural requirements that must be met before he may obtain reopening on the basis of such a claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In particular, the respondent has not submitted evidence to establish that he has notified his former attorneys of the allegations he is making against them, and he has not offered evidence to show that he has filed a complaint with the relevant disciplinary authorities regarding the conduct of his former attorneys. The respondent therefore has not met his burden of establishing that he is entitled to reopening for further proceedings due to the ineffective assistance of his former attorneys. See Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
Moreover, the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by any possible errors committed by his former attorneys. See Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent claims that he was and is eligible for relief from removal, but the respondent is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under sections 240A(a) and (b)(1) of the Act due to his criminal conviction. See section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3) (indicating that an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony is ineligible for relief); section 240A(b)(1)(B) and (C) of the Act (same). In addition, the respondent has not established that he is admissible to the United States for permanent residence as required by section 245(a) of the Act. See section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a); section 212(a)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2). The respondent claims he is eligible for a waiver of any criminal ground of inadmissibility, but he is statutorily barred from obtaining a waiver under section 212(h) of the Act due to the fact that he has been convicted of an aggravated felony since his admission to the United States as a lawful permanent resident.3 See section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h).
 
*4 Based on the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the respondent has met his burden of establishing that he is entitled to reopening for further proceedings. We therefore deny his motion to the extent that it is a motion to reopen.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider and reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is denied.

The respondent also argues that his offense does not constitute an aggravated felony as defined in sections 101(a)(43)(K)(ii) and (iii) of the Act, but neither we nor the Immigration Judge made findings to this effect. We therefore need not address the respondent’s arguments on these points.

2

The respondent also has reiterated some of the arguments he made on appeal regarding the manner in which the Immigration Judge conducted his proceedings. The respondent, however, has not pointed to any factual or legal errors in our prior determination that his arguments on this subject were not supported by the record. We therefore find it unnecessary to reconsider the respondent’s claims. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra.

3

The respondent argues that his former attorneys erred in believing that his admission to the United States as an immigrant made him ineligible for adjustment of status because he now is the beneficiary of a new, approved visa petition. The respondent, however, has misunderstood the reason his initial entry became an issue in his proceedings below. The issue was not whether the respondent was eligible to adjust his status based on the initial visa petition but whether he was eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act. If the respondent had adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident rather than entering the United States as an immigrant, he could have qualified for a waiver of inadmissibility under Martinez v. Mukasey, 519 F.3d 532 (5th Cir. 2008) and could have been prima facie eligible for adjustment of status. The respondent, however, entered the United States as an immigrant. He therefore does not qualify for the exception to the aggravated felony bar to section 212(h) relief carved out by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Martinez v. Mukasey, supra, and cannot obtain a waiver of any possible grounds of inadmissibility.

U.S. Department of Justice

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: FLORENCE MARCELIN
File: AXXX XX2 446 - Miami, FL

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nancy Denis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Monica Atkins White
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 3, 2011. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia. On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to find that the respondent demonstrated exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear. The Department of Homeland Security has moved for summary affirmance. The respondent’s appeal will be sustained.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We find that the respondent has demonstrated that exceptional circumstances prevented her from attending her hearing. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). The record reflects that the respondent has substantially complied with the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, and her motion to reopen was filed within 180 days of the entry of the in absentia order of removal. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C).
 
The affidavit submitted by the respondent’s counsel of record provides that she informed the respondent in early June 2010 that her hearing had been reset and that she would be receiving a new notice in the mail (Attachment to Respondent’s Brief at 17-18). The attorney acknowledged that she confused the respondent’s case with another client’s case, and, upon receiving the Immigration Court’s in absentia order regarding the respondent, she persuaded the respondent to allow her to correct the error in lieu of filing a complaint with the State Bar. See id; Matter of Grijalva, supra.
 
*2 Inasmuch as the record reflects that the respondent was misinformed by her counsel that she did not need to appear for her June 22, 2010, hearing, and considering the totality of the circumstances, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen and remand the record to the Immigration Judge to provide the respondent with a hearing regarding the respondent’s removability from the United States and eligibility for relief from removal. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

IN RE: CELESTINO RODRIGUEZ-MEJIA
File: AXXX XX5 235 - Memphis, TN
November 23, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent was ordered removed at a hearing before the Immigration Judge on May 21, 2009. On September 16, 2009, he submitted a Notice of Appeal. On November 30, 2009, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal as untimely. On December 17, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider. On March 2, 2010, the Board denied the motion to reconsider. On July 27, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied. The respondent’s fee waiver request is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3).
 
In our November 30, 2009, decision dismissing the respondent’s untimely appeal for lack of jurisdiction, we noted that a party wishing to file a motion to reconsider, challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, must file the motion with the Board. However, we noted that a party challenging any other finding or seeking to reopen the case must file the motion with the Immigration Court. Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). We also noted that time and number limitations exist for motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1).
 
In his December 17, 2009, motion to reconsider, the respondent argued that the Board erred in its November 30, 2009, decision in not addressing his claim that his former attorney agreed to file an appeal but failed to do so. In our March 2, 2010, decision, we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider, finding that the respondent failed to explain why the untimely appeal was submitted almost 3 months past the due date for appeal, and that the respondent has not shown due diligence. See, e.g., Tapia-Martinez v. Gonzales, 482 F.3d 417, 423 (6th Cir. 2007); Scorteanu v. INS, 339 F.3d 407, 413 (6th Cir. 2003). We also noted that the respondent failed to show his compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), including that the former attorney be notified of the charges against him and that a disciplinary complaint be filed. See also Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857, 863 (6th Cir. 2006).
 
In the current motion to reopen, the respondent argues that his proceedings should be reopened based on the ineffective assistance of counsel of the former attorney, and also argues that the 90-day motion to reopen time limitations should be tolled in his case. In support of the motion, the respondent submitted documents showing that the former attorney has been suspended from practice of law in Tennessee and before the Board, the Immigration Courts, and the DHS. The respondent also submitted a copy of his complaint against the former attorney addressed to the Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility, dated June 22, 2009.
 
*2 As we noted in our November 30, 2009, decision, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, thus a motion to reopen proceedings must be filed with the Immigration Court, and the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s motion to reopen. See Matter of Mladineo, supra; Matter of Lopez, supra. Therefore, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
We also note that the respondent’s motion to reopen essentially reiterates the ineffective assistance of counsel claim against the former attorney raised in his prior motion to reconsider. Thus, the respondent’s motion could be considered in substance a second motion to reconsider, or in the alternative a motion to reconsider our denial of his previous motion to reconsider. While the Board may have jurisdiction to consider such a motion, an alien may file only one motion to reconsider, and the regulation provides that a party may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider. Section 240(c)(6)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will also be denied as a motion to reconsider.1
 
Finally, the respondent urges that the Board should accept his appeal by certification. In our March 2, 2010, decision, the Board declined to consider this matter on certification. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c). We are not persuaded by the respondent’s motion that certification is warranted in this case. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

Even if we were to consider the arguments made in the respondent’s motion, we would not find that reopening or reconsideration is warranted. While the respondent submitted a copy of his complaint against the former attorney addressed to the Board of Professional Responsibility, dated June 22, 2009, which bears the stamp “FILE COPY,” the respondent submitted no evidence that this complaint was actually filed on June 22, 2009. If and to the extent that this complaint was filed on June 22, 2009, the same day his Notice of Appeal was due, the respondent has not explained or shown why he did not submit his Notice of Appeal with the Board until September 16, 2009, or explained why he did not submit this document during his appeal or in his previous motion to reconsider.

File: AXXX XX1 989 - Los Angeles, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mike Sethi, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated November 12, 2010, denying her motion to reopen proceedings held under section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed an opposition to the appeal, which will be sustained.
 
The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on June 23, 2006, after failing to appear for her hearing that day. The respondent thereafter filed a Notice of Appeal with the Board, which returned the record to the Immigration Judge on April 16, 2007, for consideration and adjudication of the respondent’s motion to reopen. On August 2, 2010, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen with the Immigration Court, asserting that she failed to attend her hearing because she had mechanical problems with her car on the day of the hearing, and that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel.1
 
On November 15, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen for two reasons. First, she found that the respondent did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances because counsel’s assertions that the respondent’s car suffered mechanical failure was not supported by an affidavit, the repair receipt submitted was silent as to what time of day the respondent sought the mechanic’s services, and there was no evidence the respondent attempted to contact the court regarding the delay (I.J. at 3). Second, the Immigration Judge held that the respondent did not meet the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), because the respondent did not provide an affidavit explaining the scope the Mr. Bonilla’s representation, and did not demonstrate how she was prejudiced by his representation (Id.).
 
The Immigration Judge committed clear error in finding that “[t]here is no affidavit from Respondent” (I.J. at 3). Contrary to the Immigration Judge’s findings, the respondent’s August 2, 2010, motion was accompanied by an affidavit in which she attested, among other things, that her “car broke down on the way to court, in the middle of the freeway” (Affidavit dated June 26, 2010, at ¶ 10). Thus, counsel’s assertions that the respondent’s car suffered mechanical failure was supported by an affidavit and the repair receipt considered by the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 3; Motion, tab F) was corroborative of the respondent’s sworn statement.
 
*2 The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where this case lies, has stated that it is necessary to look at the “particularized facts presented in each case” in determining whether an alien has established exceptional circumstances for failing to appear for a scheduled removal hearing. See Singh v. INS, 295 F.3d 1037, 1040 (9th Cir. 2002). We find that under the case law, the respondent has established exceptional circumstances prevented her appearance at the hearing. While traffic delays due to traffic congestion are foreseeable and have been determined in other cases to not constitute exceptional circumstances, see Sharma v. INS, 89 F.3d 545 (9th Cir. 1996), we find that the respondent’s situation is distinguishable because her car failure was not foreseeable. Moreover, unlike the aliens in DeMorales v. INS, 116 F.3d 145 (5th Cir. 1997), who provided no independent confirmation that there was a mechanical breakdown of their vehicle on the way to the hearing, the respondent in this case provided written evidence in the form of a receipt verifying that her car had mechanical difficulties on the day of the hearing. Although we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s failure to contact the Immigration Court demonstrates a lack of diligence, we nevertheless find, on balance, based on the “particularized facts” presented in this case, that the respondent demonstrated exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear. See Singh, supra.
 
Because we will sustain the appeal, and reopen and rescind the in absentia order, we do not address the respondent’s alternative contention that her was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, the proceedings are reopened, the removal order is rescinded, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael E. Piston, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 Alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent timely requests reopening of these proceedings. However, the respondent has not sufficiently shown patent error or prejudice. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); see also Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 130-31 (2d Cir.2008). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). Despite his claim that former counsel(s) failed to inform him of the need to submit certain documentary evidence, i.e., the life insurance policy, New York State identification cards, undated photographs, proof of joint filing of 2001 federal income tax return, and the joint bank account statement to the Immigration Judge, such evidence was submitted to the Board on appeal and found insufficient to establish the bona fide nature of the respondent’s former marriage. Furthermore, such evidence is not responsive to the full breadth of both the Immigration Judge’s and the Board’s reasoning, namely that the respondent and his former wife provided materially different accounts of their wedding day. On this record, no prejudice from any possible ineffective assistance of counsel has been shown. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gene E. Hays, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ted Y. Yamada
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; rescind and reissue Board decision
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on April 12, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s April 10, 2009, decision sustaining the charge of removability under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i), denying the respondent’s request to administratively close proceedings, and ordering her removed to Mexico. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel. She also moves the Board to rescind and reissue its April 12, 2011, decision. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a brief in opposition to the motion, which will be denied.
 
We conclude that the respondent has not shown that her removal proceeding was so fundamentally unfair by counsel’s performance that she was prevented from reasonably presenting her case. See Ahmed v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 768, 771 (9th Cir. 2008) (explaining that to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must, in addition to satisfying the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), “demonstrate first that counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence, and, second, that she was prejudiced by counsel’s performance”).1
 
The respondent generally asserts that prior counsel, James Rosenberg, Esquire, rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file any motions, applications for relief, or objections to the evidence presented, and also for failing to advise her of possible alternative strategies. Specifically, the respondent identifies two avenues for relief that she asserts Mr. Rosenberg should have pursued, namely adjustment of status based on the respondent’s United States citizen daughter, and cancellation of removal based upon her alleged continuous physical presence in the United States since prior to January 1, 1972. Both of these avenues of relief, however, would have been futile for prior counsel to have pursued.
 
The respondent, having been found removable under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act, is not eligible to pursue adjustment of status, as alien smuggling under this section of the Act renders the respondent inadmissible to the United States. See section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). Moreover, the respondent, who became a lawful permanent resident in June 2007, did not have the requisite period of continuous lawful residence in the United States to be eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), as all prior entrances into the United States were without admission (Tr. at 5-7). The Immigration Judge and Mr. Rosenberg discussed avenues of relief for the respondent but, based on the circumstances, Mr. Rosenberg concluded that the respondent qualified for no relief from removal (Tr. at 4-7).
 
*2 As for the respondent’s assertion that Mr. Rosenberg rendered ineffective assistance by not filing any motions or objections to the evidence presented by the DHS, she has neither identified a motion that could have been filed, nor indicated how the failure to file such a motion prejudiced her. Likewise, the respondent has neither identified to which specific evidence Mr. Rosenberg should have objected, nor shown that the failure to raise an objection prejudiced her. For example, insofar as the respondent contends that Mr. Rosenberg should have objected to the admission of her statements to the DHS because Miranda warnings were not issued, the Board previously concluded in its April 12,2011, decision, that such warning were not required to be given.
 
Finally, the respondent appears to assert that Mr. Rosenberg failed to advise her that she could have filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and on this basis she requests the Board to rescind and reissue its April 12, 2011, decision. Although in rare cases we have reissued decisions in order to remedy a lack of notice arising from the ineffective assistance of an alien’s counsel of record, this is reserved for very exceptional circumstances not present here. Also, the respondent has not shown that in this instance Mr. Rosenberg rendered ineffective assistance. The record indicates that, although no motion to withdraw or to substitute counsel was filed with the Immigration Court, Mr. Rosenberg last appeared on behalf of the respondent at the May 13, 2008, hearing. Thereafter, new counsel, Michael Brooks, Esquire, appeared on the respondent’s behalf at the respondent’s final hearing on April 10, 2009, and the respondent was represented by different counsel, Serena A. Siew, Esquire, on appeal to the Board. The respondent has not shown that competent counsel, representing the respondent at the stage in proceedings that Mr. Rosenberg represented the respondent, would have advised her that she could file a petition for review, or that an attorney at that stage of proceedings had a duty to do so. Further, the respondent has not shown that Mr. Rosenberg’s alleged failure to advise prejudiced her. Also, the respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance by Mr. Brooks or Ms. Siew. The following order will thus be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and to rescind and reissue is denied.

IN RE: ABRAHAM BRADLEY
File: AXXX XX9 815 - Oakdale, LA
October 5, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on August 16, 2011, when we found the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim to be insufficient and dismissed the respondent’s appeal as untimely. On September 6, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider with the Board based on the alleged ineffective assistance of his former counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a brief in opposition to the motion. For the reasons set out below, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent’s motion is both a motion to reconsider and a motion to reopen. A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based upon the previous factual record, whereas a motion to reopen seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57-58 (BIA 2006). A party seeking reconsideration requests that the original decision be reexamined in light of alleged legal or factual errors, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. See 0-S-G-, supra; Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). Here, the respondent requests that we reconsider our prior decision, but also proffers additional evidence (see Respondent’s Motion, Tabs 1-6). Consequently, we shall treat the respondent’s motion as both a motion to reconsider and a motion to reopen.
 
To the extent the respondent’s motion is a motion to reconsider, it does not specify errors of fact or law in our prior decision and is not supported with pertinent authority (see generally Respondent’s Motion). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); Matter of O-S-G-, supra. To the extent the respondent’s motion is a motion to reopen reasserting his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, it does not comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent’s motion is not supported with evidence that a complaint has been filed with the appropriate bar or an adequate explanation for the failure to file such a complaint. See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 498 (5th Cir. 2000). Instead, the respondent has filed a letter from a Joey Melancon indicating that the family “requested” that his former counsel appeal his case (Respondent’s Motion at 2, Tab 1); and has not filed a bar complaint “because he never knew.” (Respondent’s Motion at 3).1
 
*2 Further, the respondent has provided his former counsel’s response to his allegations, in which she disputes that she agreed to file an appeal on his behalf and further points out that the respondent was unable to provide her any documentation to support his claim to derivative United States citizenship. Based on the totality of the evidence, the respondent has not established that his counsel was to blame for the untimeliness of his appeal. The respondent has also not provided evidence with the motion that raises a colorable claim to United States citizenship or eligibility for relief from removal. He therefore also has not demonstrated that he suffered the prejudice from his former counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance in the proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5 Cir. 1994). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

File: AXXX XX9 236 - Hartford, CT
September 30, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rahul Chakravartty, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s September 2, 2010, decision denying her untimely motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b). The Department of Homeland Security did not file a response. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, and review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues on appeal, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i),(ii).
 
On March 14, 2006, the respondent was ordered removed in absentia under section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). Her motion to reopen was granted on May 1, 2009, and on March 23, 2010, the respondent was granted 120 days or until July 21, 2010, to voluntarily depart under section 240B(a)(2)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(2)(A). The respondent did not voluntarily depart by the given date, and filed an untimely motion to reopen on July 9, 2010,1 which was denied by the Immigration Judge. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent sought to reopen the proceedings in order to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i), based on a pending employment-based visa petition (Form I-140). She asserted the filing requirements governing her untimely motion should have been equitably tolled based on her claims of ineffective assistance of prior counsel, Kenneth E. McKeon, Esquire.
 
Upon our de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen. Equitable tolling is available if the respondent exercised due diligence in pursuing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and demonstrated that she was prejudiced by prior counsel’s actions. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 130-32 (2d Cir. 2008); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170-71 (2d Cir. 2006); Iavorksi v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000). While the respondent submitted2 her affidavit alleging prior counsel’s ineffective assistance and a complaint packet sent to prior counsel’s law office (see Respondent’s Motion at Tabs AA, BB, July 9, 2010), these documents do not persuasively establish that the proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133, 143 (2d Cir. 2007) (requiring substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements); Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 2 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556-67 (2003).
 
*2 Contrary to the respondent’s appellate contentions, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated that she was prejudiced by her prior counsel’s tactical decisions (I.J. Order at 2-3, Sept. 2, 2010; see Respondent’s Brief at 7-8). See Debeatham v. Holder, 602 F.3d 481, 486 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640); see also Jiang v. Mukasey, 522 F.3d 266, 270-71 (2d Cir. 2008) (stating that an attorney’s decision, even if unwise in hindsight, is a tactical decision that does not constitute ineffective assistance). The record shows the respondent was granted multiple continuances in light of her pending visa petition and her claimed eligibility for section 245(i) adjustment of status (I.J. Order at 2-3, Sept. 2, 2010). When prior counsel again requested a continuance, the Immigration Judge considered his arguments which included prior counsel’s two-page memorandum that addressed issues already known to the parties (I.J. Order at 2-3, Sept. 2, 2010; Respondent’s Motion at 3, Dec. 1, 2009).
 
Similarly, prior counsel’s tactical decision to seek the 120-day voluntary departure in light of the respondent’s pending visa petition did not show that the proceedings were fundamentally unfair, thereby prejudicing the respondent. See Jiang v. Mukasey, supra, at 270 (holding that where an attorney advises a client, as a tactical matter, to seek voluntary departure rather than pursue other forms of relief, the proceedings remain fundamentally fair). The case was adjourned until March 23, 2010, to provide the respondent the opportunity to consider voluntary departure in lieu of a removal order and to accommodate the completion of her business school studies (I.J. at 2). See Debeatham v. Holder, supra, at 485; Jiang v. Mukasey, supra, at 270-71. Thus, the Immigration Judge properly considered the factors set forth in Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009), and determined that good cause was not shown to continue the proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6; see Elbahja v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir. 2007); Morgan v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 549, 551 (2d Cir. 2006); see Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).
 
Finally, we will not exercise our sua sponte authority, which is an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations, to reopen the proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003 2(a); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). We note the record does not adequately establish the respondent’s prima facie eligibility to adjust status under section 245(i) of the Act, and does not reflect that the respondent’s visa petition has been approved with a current priority date during the pendency of this appeal.3 For these reasons, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Because the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed prior to the expiration of the 120-day period, it automatically terminated the grant of voluntary departure and rendered the penalties inapplicable. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).

The respondent’s appellate brief does not indicate whether the Lozada complaint packet was sent to the appropriate disciplinary authorities (Respondent’s Brief at 6-7). The appellate brief also does not indicate whether prior counsel replied to the Lozada complaint. See Debeatham v. Holder, 602 F.3d 481, 485 (2d Cir. 2010) (expressing the Lozada requirements are aimed, in large part, informing prior counsel of the alleged ineffectiveness and providing him the opportunity to respond).

In December 2009, when the respondent’s prior counsel made the tactical decision to accept a grant of the maximum period of voluntary departure, visas were available only for petitions filed prior to June 2002 (I.J. at 2, Respondent’s appeal brief at 7). The respondent’s priority date is December 1, 2006 (I.J. at 2). Although the respondent optimistically stated in her appeal brief that a visa might become available to her “in approximately 3 months,” from the filing of the brief in October 2010, this does not establish that she was prejudiced by her prior counsel’s representation in December 2009. Further, we take administrative notice of the Department of State Visa Bulletin for October 2011, which shows that the current priority date for 3rd preference employment visas is December 8, 2005. Therefore, even assuming that she had established that she is a grandfathered alien based on an earlier petition that was withdrawn or denied (I.J. at 1), her priority date is still not current more than a year after the Immigration Judge denied the untimely motion to reopen. See http://www.travel.state.gov/visa/bulletin/bulletin_1360.html.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Toni A. Lawson, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on June 30, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated May 11, 2007, and reinstated a 60-day period of voluntary departure. The respondent filed the instant motion to reopen nearly 3 years later, on May 9, 2011, well beyond the 90-day deadline applicable to motions to reopen. See sections 240(c)(7)(A) & (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent urges that the time limits should be equitably tolled because he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The time limits for motions to reopen may be equitably tolled where an alien raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). An alien must, however, demonstrate that he has been diligent in raising the claim and must show that he has been prejudiced by counsel’s conduct. Id.; Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999).
 
The respondent asserts he was the victim of ineffective assistance by two attorneys. First, he contends, as he did on direct appeal, that Attorney Ramoncito Ocampo rendered ineffective assistance following the denial of a visa petition by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) by failing to re-file the visa petition or appeal the CIS’s decision, and by failing to advise the respondent with respect to the Immigration Judge’s voluntary departure order. Second, he contends that Attorney Colin Greene rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file an appeal with the CIS, by mishandling the filing of a new visa petition, by failing to notify the respondent of a Request for Evidence, and by failing to file a petition for review of the Board’s decision.
 
We find the respondent has not persuaded us of his diligence in raising his ineffective assistance claims. Importantly, the respondent has not provided an adequate explanation as to why he did not raise a claim of ineffective assistance against either attorney in a timely motion. We observe that the respondent presumably received a copy of our June 30, 2008, decision in which we explained the import in this case of complying with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent has submitted a declaration with his motion, but it does not adequately explain what steps he took after being advised of the Board’s decision or why it took him nearly 3 years to pursue his ineffective assistance claims. The respondent states only that he “has tried very hard to keep on top of [his] case” (Motion, tab F, Declaration dated April 29, 2011, ¶ 4). We find insufficient evidence of diligence to support equitable tolling.
 
*2 Nor do we find that an exceptional situation exists that would warrant sua sponte reopening in our discretion. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(a), (c)(3); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Significantly, the respondent’s failure to depart from the United States within the time period allowed for voluntary departure under the Board’s final order rendered him statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status for a period of 10 years from that failure to depart. See sections 240A(b) and 240B(d)(1)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(b) & 1229c(d)(1)(B); see also de Martinez v. Ashcroft, 374 F.3d 759 (9th Cir. 2004) (relief could not be granted on motion to reopen filed after expiration of the voluntary departure time period). To the extent the respondent argues Attorney Ocampo did not adequately explain the Immigration Judge’s voluntary departure order to him, we find the Board’s order reinstating voluntary departure was clear, and the respondent has not argued that Attorney Greene did not provide him with a copy of that order (Motion, tab F, Declaration dated April 29, 2011, ¶¶ 2-3). Based on the foregoing, we do not find that sua sponte reopening in our discretion is warranted. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied and the stay request will be deemed moot.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eli A. Echols, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order of removal in this case on January 28, 2011, when it summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 3, 2010, written decision. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(A), (E). On April 28, 2011, the respondent filed the instant untimely motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his former attorney in full compliance with the procedures set froth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), and his former attorney admits error in her handling of the respondent’s case. The respondent also stresses his business and family ties in the United States, and he contests the fairness of the proceedings before the Immigration Judge. The Department of Homeland Security has not opposed the motion. Given the particular circumstances of this case, the Board will exercise its sua sponte authority and reopen the removal proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (discussing the Board’s authority to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte in exceptional situations); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly the motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s March 3, 2010, decision is vacated and the record is remanded for a new hearing before a different Immigration Judge.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert G. Berke, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
M. Kristina DeGuzman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on April 26, 2011, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, which was based on a claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel. On June 24, 2011, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider that decision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must identify an error of fact or law in the Board’s prior decision. See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The respondent urges that the Board should revisit its denial of his motion to reopen.
 
The respondent was ordered removed in absentia and filed a pro se motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge and a pro se appeal with the Board before obtaining counsel and filing his motion to reopen with the Board. In the motion, the respondent argued he was ineffectively represented by Attorney Sung Park, who allegedly prepared his motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge and his Notice of Appeal with the Board, notwithstanding that the motion and appeal were filed pro se. We denied the motion to reopen, finding the respondent had not substantially complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and noting that the motion had not been supported by a statement from the respondent and that there was no evidence that Attorney Park had been informed of the significant allegations against him. Urging reconsideration, the respondent now argues that the Board misconstrued counsel’s assertions (Motion at 4), and that Attorney Park’s apparent withdrawal at the in absentia hearing is not dispositive in light of his ethical obligations to the respondent (Motion at 5-8).
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s contentions that our prior decision was in error. Importantly, he has not shown any error in our determination that this is a case where it is important to meet the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), which requires that, “before allegations of ineffective assistance of former counsel are presented to the Board, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond.”
 
*2 This requirement is not a mere formality, but rather serves the dual functions of discouraging baseless allegations and providing attorneys “whose integrity or competence is being impugned,” the opportunity to present their version of events if they choose to do so. Id. Moreover, providing notice to the attorney whose actions are being challenged, and allowing him or her sufficient time to respond, is a central element in this Board’s capacity to adjudicate ineffective assistance of counsel claims. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598-99 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent did not present evidence with his motion that Attorney Park has been apprised of the serious allegations levied against him, and has still not done so. Accordingly, the motion to reconsider will be denied. The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William Frick, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathan Love
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen the Board’s April 28, 2011, decision dismissing his appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision. He also seeks a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which is denied.
 
The respondent avers that former counsel, Kaaren Barr, provided him with ineffective assistance by failing to request a continuance pending the adjudication of his appeal of his rape conviction, and to await unspecified “comprehensive immigration reform” (Motion at 4-5). He further contends that attorney Sharon Healy erred by not raising these issues on appeal (Declaration).
 
However, the respondent has not complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as there is no evidence that he filed a bar complaint against either attorney. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent has also not demonstrated that he suffered any prejudice as a result of former counsels’ actions. The DHS has submitted evidence showing that the Court of Appeals affirmed the respondent’s rape conviction, and that his petition for review of this decision was denied. Thus, his arguments in this regard are moot. Further, he has not demonstrated “good cause” existed for a continuance. His conjecture that there will be comprehensive immigration reform and that he will qualify for relief arising out of that reform is speculative, and insufficient to demonstrate prejudicial error by either attorney. Reopening is also not appropriate in order to allow the respondent to pursue discretionary relief in the form of adjustment of status. While he has submitted evidence that he is engaged to a United States citizen, they are not married, and there is no evidence that he is the beneficiary of a viable visa petition filed on his behalf. As he has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for relief, we find no basis for reopening in this regard. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion and stay request are denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ana R. Schvartz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Nora E. Norman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s order dated November 2, 2010, denying his motion to reopen proceedings.1 The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on August 3, 2010, after he did not appear for a removal hearing and the Immigration Judge sustained the charge of removability contained in the Notice to Appear. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of fact under a clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not meet his burden in showing that exceptional circumstances excuse his failure to appear for the August 3, 2010, hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent argues first that he did not appear at the hearing because his prior attorney failed to notify him of the hearing. In some cases, ineffective assistance of counsel may constitute exceptional circumstances warranting reopening of proceedings. See Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 798, 801-02 (5th Cir. 2007). We agree with the Immigration Judge, however, that the respondent did not satisfy the factors set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the respondent did not address the requirement that prior counsel be given the opportunity to respond to the allegations, nor did the respondent address the requirement that a disciplinary complaint be filed with the appropriate authorities. See Matter of Lozada, supra. Although the respondent states on appeal that he is “in the process” of satisfying the Lozada requirements (Br. at 2), the materials submitted fall far short of compliance with the established framework. See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-99 (5th Cir. 2006) (upholding the need to comply with the Lozada requirements). Accordingly, we conclude that the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen on the basis that the respondent did not properly establish ineffective assistance of counsel. See id.
 
*2 We also disagree with the respondent’s appellate contention that as an individual under the age of 21, the notice provided to counsel was inadequate. We first note that providing written notice of hearing to an alien’s counsel of record constitutes proper service pursuant to section 239(a)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(2). Although the respondent argues that his age, 19 years old at the time the hearing notice was sent, constitutes an exceptional circumstance, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, has previously found service of a hearing notice on a 17 year old respondent in removal proceedings to be proper. Lopez-Duron v. Holder, 609 F.3d 642, 646 (5th Cir. 2010) (noting that the 17 year old had almost reached “legal adulthood”). The respondent also contends on appeal that he was not served with a copy of the charging document and therefore did not receive the warnings concerning the failure to appear contained therein (Br. at 5). The record indicates, however, that the respondent was personally served with this document (see Ex. 1). For these reasons, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not shown that exceptional circumstances excuse the respondent’s failure to appear. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX3 619 - Arlington, VA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Daniel J. Hwang, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Emily C. Reece
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 In an oral decision dated May 3, 2011, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable; determined that he did not apply for, and did not demonstrate eligibility for, any relief from removal; and ordered him removed from the United States to Peru.1 The respondent appealed from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent was found removable on three of the four charged grounds, as convicted of an aggravated felony under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), in conjunction with section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B); as convicted of a controlled substance violation under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act; and as convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act.2 As substantiated by conviction documents, he has March 5, 2010, Virginia convictions upon guilty pleas for two counts of possession with intent to deliver marijuana and for possession of cocaine. See Ex. 2. For those crimes, he was sentenced to three 5-year prison terms, to run concurrently for the marijuana trafficking crimes and consecutively for the cocaine possession crime. He was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on or about December 5, 2006. Upon our de novo review, we find correct the Immigration Judge’s conclusions concerning the respondent’s removability and ineligibility for relief.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he wishes to pursue post-conviction relief concerning one or more of his convictions based on Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 2010 WL 1222274 (March 31, 2010), because he entered at least one defective guilty plea due to ineffective assistance from criminal counsel. He states that the government refused to issue him an “S” visa, despite his cooperation with the authorities in a criminal case. He contends that he also received ineffective assistance from his immigration counsel. He alleges that his removal proceedings were unfair.
 
To the extent that the respondent maintains that the Immigration Judge should have granted him an additional continuance of his removal hearings, we observe that the decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, and good cause must be shown for a continuance. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1997); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. In this case, the Immigration Judge allowed the respondent six previous continuances, from December 21, 2010, until January 11, 2011; from January 11, 2011, until January 25, 2011; from January 25, 2011, until March 22, 2011; from March 22, 2011, until March 29, 2011; from March 29, 2011, until April 19, 2011; and from April 19, 2011, until May 3, 2011. The first continuance was given so that the respondent could secure an immigration attorney. The second, third, fifth, and sixth continuances were given for the purpose of attorney case preparation. At the third hearing on January 25, 2011, the attorney informed the Immigration Judge that the respondent was seeking the “S” visa. The fourth continuance was granted because the immigration attorney was not present at the hearing on March 22, 2011. As of the seventh and final hearing on May 3, 2011, the respondent still had not obtained the “S” visa, and the immigration attorney mentioned the possibility of pursuing post-conviction relief as his only available option. See Tr. at 13, 25-26; I.J. at 2-3. We find that the Immigration Judge acted appropriately in not allowing a seventh continuance.
 
*2 Concerning the validity of a conviction, the fact that the respondent may be pursuing post-conviction relief in the form of a collateral attack on a conviction in state criminal court does not affect its finality for federal immigration purposes. See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992). The respondent has presented no evidence with this appeal that any attack on a conviction has resulted in any vacatur or has even been filed. In Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a lawyer representing an alien in connection with a guilty plea to a criminal offense has a constitutional duty to advise the alien about the risk of deportation arising from the conviction. However, the respondent’s speculation that a conviction might be invalid, including in light of Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, does not change the finality for immigration purposes of that conviction, unless and until it were to be overturned by a criminal court. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996). He thus stands convicted of the 2010 crimes. He has not disputed that the convictions for possession with intent to deliver marijuana are drug trafficking offenses that are aggravated felonies and also particularly serious crimes.3
 
Concerning the alleged ineffective assistance from immigration counsel, we observe that the respondent has failed to offer any evidence that substantially complies with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and he further has failed to demonstrate that he suffered the requisite prejudice from counsel’s purported action or inaction such that a remand for consideration of his claim would be warranted, based on his cursory and unsupported appellate allegations. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). The respondent was found to be ineligible for removal relief by the Immigration Judge. In appealing, the respondent has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for the only removal relief for which he is potentially eligible, CAT deferral, and he has not indicated that he would like to apply for such relief. At his removal hearings, he did not express any fear of torture upon his return to Peru. To the extent that the respondent contends that his removal proceedings were unfair, we find that he has not demonstrated any error by the Immigration Judge in handling his hearings, under the circumstances of this case. We also find that he has not demonstrated any resultant prejudice such as would amount to a due process violation. See Anim v. Mukasey, 535 F.3d 243 (4th Cir. 2008).4
 
*3 Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The proceedings before the Immigration Judge in this matter were completed in Arlington, Virginia through video conference pursuant to section 240(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(2)(A)(iii).

The respondent is a lawful permanent resident who has been convicted of aggravated felonies and who also has been convicted of per se particularly serious crimes, since he was sentenced to a 5-year prison term for each of the marijuana trafficking offenses. As such, the only form of removal relief for which he is potentially eligible is deferral of removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (“CAT”). See sections 208(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 208(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 1158(b)(2)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c)(4) and 1208.16(d)(2) and (3).

On appeal, the respondent references the Sixth Amendment. As he acknowledges concerning the right to counsel, he has no constitutional right to appointed counsel as an alien in immigration proceedings, although he has a statutory right to counsel at no expense to the government pursuant to section 292 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1362. In this case, the respondent has not demonstrated any violation of his statutory right to counsel. He was represented by an attorney at his second through seventh removal hearings, and he is represented on appeal by a law firm colleague of that attorney.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Stephen A. Lagana, Esquire
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 1, 2009, denying his motion to reopen proceedings based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether or not the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On January 19, 2001, an Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure. At this time the respondent was represented by counsel and was fully informed of the requirement that he depart the United States pursuant to this order. The respondent did not appeal from this decision. He argues that in this same month he contacted a new attorney who informed him he was not required to follow the Immigration Judge’s order but, rather, under a new law he would not be required to leave the United States if he filed a new application for relief. This attorney has since been suspended from practice. The respondent claims to have paid her $6,000 for her services, but, other than the respondent’s affidavit, no proof of any contact with this attorney has been submitted.
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge, with the following notations. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). First, the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Compean, Bangley & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). While the respondent argues that the attorney in question has already been suspended from practice, there is no proof that the respondent was, himself, ineffectively served by this attorney. In fact, other than the affidavit, there is no proof this respondent had any contact at all with the attorney.
 
The respondent does not contest the Immigration Judge’s finding that he was properly represented before the Immigration Court on January 19, 2001, at which time he was informed of the requirement that he depart the United States. Whether or not in 2001 he contacted the attorney who is now suspended from practice, he took no further action to determine his status until 2004, at which time he allegedly learned, from another attorney, that he was being ineffectively served by counsel. He then waited until September 2009, to file the current motion to reopen. The respondent failed to act with due diligence under the circumstances. See Neves v. Holder, 613 F.3d 30 (1st Cir. 2010) (requiring due diligence); Chedid v. Holder, 573 F.3d 33 (1st Cir. 2009) (same). We also decline to reopen the proceedings sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. §1003.2(a); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999) (Board’s discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”).
 
*2 Based on the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX0 617 - Atlanta, GA
August 18, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christian G.A. Zeller, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on April 20, 2009, when we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen based on changed country conditions. On February 3, 2011, the respondent filed his third motion to reopen.1 The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied as untimely and numerically barred.
 
Section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), states that an alien may file one motion to reopen. The respondent’s motion, however, is his third motion to reopen. The motion therefore is numerically barred.
 
Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, in turn, states that motions to reopen “shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.” An Immigration Judge issued the final administrative order of removal in the respondent’s case on August 9, 2001. The respondent, however, did not file his current motion until more than 9 1/2 years later. The respondent’s motion therefore is untimely.
 
The respondent, a native of Palestine, asks that we grant his motion pursuant to our sua sponte authority due to the exceptional circumstances of his case. In particular, he contends that he is a stateless person who cannot be removed, he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel which caused him to accept voluntary departure instead of pursuing adjustment of status, and he is now married to a United States citizen and the beneficiary of an approved visa petition.
 
The respondent has not submitted sufficient evidence to support his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. First, the respondent has not established that the attorney against whom he makes the claim actually represented him during his removal proceedings. The hearing notices in the record contain the name of a different attorney, and the record does not contain a Notice of Entry of Appearance for the respondent’s removal proceedings from the attorney against whom the respondent is making allegations. The agreement the respondent claims he signed with this attorney also does not specify that the attorney was assisting the respondent with his removal proceedings as opposed to his visa petition proceedings. See Respondent’s Motion To Reopen Removal Proceedings Sua Sponte, Tab J. Without some evidence to show that the attorney against whom the respondent is raising allegations actually represented the respondent during his removal proceedings, we cannot address the respondent’s allegations that this attorney’s conduct affected the outcome of the respondent’s case. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 Second, the respondent has not provided evidence to indicate either that he has notified his former attorney of the allegations against him or that he actually has filed the complaint he prepared against this attorney with the Georgia Bar. Given the seriousness of the allegations the respondent has raised, notice to his former attorney or an explanation as to why no notice was sent is necessary before we may assess the merits of the respondent’s claims. See Matter of Lozada, supra. The filing of a complaint with the proper disciplinary authorities or an explanation as to why no complaint was filed is also necessary. Id.
 
Without a supported claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we cannot conclude that the respondent has provided a sufficient explanation for remaining in this country for more than 10 years after he was required to depart voluntarily.2 We also cannot conclude that the respondent’s case involves exceptional circumstances. Becoming eligible for relief from removal after a final administrative order has been entered, as the respondent has done, is common and does not, in itself, constitute an exceptional circumstance warranting our consideration of an untimely motion. To hold otherwise would vitiate the statutory and regulatory deadlines, which are designed to bring finality to immigration proceedings. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992) (motions to reopen are especially disfavored in immigration proceedings because every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien).
 
The respondent contends that he is stateless and that this fact adds to the exceptional circumstances in his case, but we disagree. The record includes a travel document from Palestine bearing the respondent’s name, and the respondent has submitted a copy of a birth certificate showing his birth in Palestine. The respondent has not explained adequately why he cannot obtain a new travel document from Palestine.
 
Based on the foregoing, we do not find that the respondent has submitted sufficient evidence to establish that his case involves exceptional circumstances justifying the exercise of our sua sponte authority. We therefore decline to reopen his case pursuant to our sua sponte authority, and we deny his motion to reopen as untimely and numerically barred.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent filed a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with the Immigration Court on January 31, 2006.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Chester L. Wheless, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert T. Burton
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated March 29, 2011, declining to further continue his removal proceedings and ordering his removal to Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including any determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Before the Immigration Judge, the respondent conceded his removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien who, at any time after admission, has been convicted of an aggravated felony (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 7-8). The respondent requested a continuance so that he could pursue post-conviction relief in Texas, but the Immigration Judge denied the request (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 8-10). On appeal, the respondent does not challenge his removability. Instead, he argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to continue and claims that the conviction underlying his charge of removal is invalid pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010).1
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to continue, as he has not established “good cause” for a continuance. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the Immigration Judge’s discretion and will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing. Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987). A collateral attack does not impair the validity of an alien’s conviction for immigration purposes. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). As of the respondent’s March 29, 2011, hearing, no challenge to his conviction had been filed, and his belief that the conviction may be invalid is insufficient to establish good cause for a continuance (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 7-10). See Cabral v. Holder, 632 F.3d 886, 890 (5th Cir. 2011) (the Board is not required to hold removal proceedings in abeyance pending motions for post-conviction relief in state court). We are not persuaded by the respondent’s argument that Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, requires Immigration Judges to stay proceedings while an alien pursues post-conviction relief. See Respondent’s Brief at 3-4.2 As the respondent has not shown that he was deprived of a full and fair hearing, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny a further continuance.
 
*2 The respondent also requests remand and has submitted evidence on appeal indicating that a challenge to his conviction has now been filed. In this case, the requirements for a motion to remand are essentially the same as the requirements for a motion to reopen. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-73 (BIA 1992); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The evidence submitted on appeal is not material to the respondent’s request for a continuance, as it does not establish that his conviction has been vacated. As noted above, unless and until the respondent’s conviction is overturned, the pendency of a collateral challenge does not affect the finality of the conviction for immigration purposes. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, supra, at 327.
 
The respondent’s brief states that a separate motion to remand will be filed to substantiate the claim raised on appeal that he received ineffective assistance of counsel before the Immigration Judge; however, we have not received the motion, and the brief does not indicate when it will be filed. See Respondent’s Brief at 2. As the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), and current counsel’s unsupported statements in the appellate brief are not evidence, we also decline to remand on this basis. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

In that decision, the Supreme Court held that a defendant had sufficiently alleged that his counsel was constitutionally deficient because counsel must inform a client whether his plea carries a risk of removal.

2

The respondent also contends that the failure to continue such cases results in a “continuing” deprivation of the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See Respondent’s Brief at 4. Aliens do not have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel in immigration proceedings. Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006). Moreover, Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, does not indicate that an alien may pursue a Padilla-based claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in immigration proceedings in an effort to collaterally challenge a prior conviction.

File: AXXX XX9 815 - Oakdale, LA
August 16, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
*1 On July 11, 2011, the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) with this Board seeking to challenge the Immigration Judge’s February 24, 2011, decision finding him removable as charged, and ordering him removed to his native Belize. The respondent’s appeal is untimely, inasmuch as it was filed months after the March 28, 2011, due date.1
 
The respondent attributes the late filing of his appeal to ineffective assistance provided by attorney Maria Calvo, who he claims to have retained to handle his case. He contends that after the close of his removal hearing (which he explains was conducted telephonically), he “contacted” Ms. Calvo requesting that an appeal be filed in his case2 so that he could remain in the United States with his family and children. He contends that “after a recent call,” he became aware that an appeal in his case had not been filed.3
 
As pertinent here, the respondent is advancing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against attorney Calvo concerning her failure to timely file an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision. However, he has not fully complied with the requirements for presenting such a claim, as delineated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 498 (5th Cir. 2000). Although the respondent has submitted a copy of a letter to attorney Calvo setting forth his related ineffective assistance, this letter is undated. In addition, no proof has been provided confirming that this letter was actually mailed to, and received by, attorney Calvo, such that it is established that she was given a reasonable opportunity to respond to the allegations being made against her.
 
The respondent also contends that his family paid attorney Calvo a $500.00 retainer fee for her services. No corroborating evidence of this contention has been provided. Even assuming this representation to be true, there has been no showing that the services attorney Calvo agreed to provide included the filing of an appeal. Indeed, the record reflects that both the respondent’s attorney and the Department of Homeland Security actually affirmatively waived appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision. See February 24, 2011, I.J. decision (reflecting the Immigration Judge handwritten notation of “NO APPEAL,” and “B” (signifying both parties)).
 
In addition, the respondent’s submissions do not establish that he filed a bar complaint against attorney Calvo, and he had not explained why he did not do so. See Matter of Lozada, supra (requiring a showing, in part, that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not).
 
*2 The respondent’s submissions do not provide an adequate basis for taking this appeal on certification. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c). Thus, his appeal is untimely, and the Immigration Judge’s decision is now final. As such, the record will be returned to the Immigration Court without further action.
 
Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed as untimely.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Chris Christensen, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lillian Alves
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s December 10, 2009, decision denying his request for a continuance. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has submitted a brief in opposition to the appeal.1 The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and matters of discretion, under a de novo standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Notice to Appear (Exh. 1) commencing his removal proceedings was defective, and did not in fact provide the Immigration Court with jurisdiction over such proceedings, because it did not specify the date and time at which the respondent’s first removal hearing would take place. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that a Notice to Appear is not defective simply because it indicates that a hearing time and date will be scheduled later, so long as the alien is in fact sent notice of the hearing once it is scheduled. See Popa v. Holder, 571 F.3d 890, 896 (9th Cir. 2009); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.18(b) (concerning Notices to Appear and Hearing Notices). The respondent does not allege that he lacked notice of the later scheduled hearings, and indeed he appeared at each of his removal hearings. The respondent’s argument concerning the validity of his Notice to Appear thus lacks merit.
 
The respondent further contends on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for a continuance. The decision to grant or deny a continuance, if good cause is shown, is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, and that decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987); see also Sandoval-Luna v. Mukasey, 526 F.3d 1243, 1246-47 (9th Cir. 2008).
 
The respondent’s desire to obtain a “second opinion” concerning his removal proceedings did not amount to good cause justifying a continuance of his removal proceedings. Notably, the respondent has advanced no explanation for his failure to seek such a “second opinion” during the 5-month period that the Immigration Judge had granted him to explore whether he might be eligible for any form of relief from removal. See Tr. at 4-6, 11; cf. Delgado-Ortiz v. Holder, 600 F.3d 1148, 1150-51 (9th Cir. 2010) (explaining that motions to reopen “are particularly disfavored in immigration proceedings, where ‘every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States”’) (citing INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992)); Respondent’s Brief at Attachment C (Respondent’s Affidavit, reflecting that respondent’s dissatisfaction with former counsel arose “between the July hearing and the December hearing”). We therefore will not reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to continue.
 
*2 Moreover, the respondent has failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel which would warrant remand of the record for further proceedings. The respondent has not complied with any of the criteria for setting forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Nor are we persuaded by the respondent’s contention that former counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance is plain on the face of the record. See, e.g., Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 597-99 (9th Cir. 2004).
 
Furthermore, even if the respondent had established that former counsel provided ineffective assistance, he has failed to establish that he was prejudiced thereby. That is, he has not shown that the outcome of his case “may” have been different absent the alleged ineffective assistance of prior counsel. See Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893, 898 (9th Cir. 2008) (reiterating that an alien may establish the requisite prejudice for purposes of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim by showing that the outcome of his or her hearing “may” have been different absent deficient performance of counsel). While the respondent alleges that former counsel failed to explore certain aspects of his case, he has not raised any claims on appeal which could undermine the Immigration Judge’s determination of removability, or which reflect that the respondent may be eligible for some form of relief from removal.2 His ineffective assistance of counsel claim therefore fails.
 
We also are unpersuaded by the respondent’s appellate contention that the Immigration Judge denied him his right to be represented by the attorney of his choice. See, e.g., Ram v. Mukasey, 529 F.3d 1238 (9th Cir. 2008); Tawadrus v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 1099, 1103 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent appeared at each of his removal hearings with his attorney of record. As indicated above, the respondent has provided no explanation for his failure to obtain new counsel during the 5-month period between his initial and his final hearings. His dissatisfaction with his former counsel’s conclusion that he was ineligible for relief from removal did not require the Immigration Judge to grant him additional time to obtain new counsel.
 
The respondent also alleges that the Immigration Judge abandoned his role as neutral arbiter by questioning the respondent to determine whether there was good cause to grant his request for a continuance, and that he appeared more concerned with former counsel’s potential ethical quandary than with the respondent’s dissatisfaction with former counsel. However, Immigration Judges have broad authority to regulate the course of a removal hearing, and may receive evidence, interrogate, examine and cross-examine the alien or witnesses. See section 240(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b); 8 C.F.R. § § 1003.10(b), 12401(c). The record reflects that the Immigration Judge appropriately questioned the respondent, and properly considered the totality of the record in finding that the respondent had failed to show good cause for a continuance. See generally Vargas-Hernandez v. Gonzales, 497 F.3d 919, 926-27 (9th Cir. 2007); Matter of Exame, 18 I&N Dec. 303 (BIA 1982).
 
*3 Further, as noted above, the record remains devoid of evidence that the respondent may be eligible for any form of relief from removal, or that he is not removable as charged. He thus has failed to establish the existence of prejudice. Consequently, the respondent has failed to establish a due process claim necessitating remand of the record. See generally Yan Liu v. Holder, 632 F.3d 1150, 1161-62 (9th Cir. 2011) (reiterating that alien must establish prejudice in order to prevail on a due process claim).
 
In sum, the respondent has not established any jurisdictional defect or due process violation which would warrant remand of the record to the Immigration Judge. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

The respondent submitted a reply brief with a motion to accept reply brief, and the DHS has opposed such motion. As the respondent’s reply brief was submitted outside of the time set in the briefing schedule, and the respondent has not asserted surprise at any of the assertions contained in the DHS’s brief, we will not consider the arguments made in the respondent’s reply brief. See BIA Practice Manual Chapter 4.6(h).

2

For instance, the respondent asserts on appeal that former counsel provided deficient assistance by not objecting to the admission of the Notice to Appear into evidence, and by admitting the factual allegations and conceding the charge of removability on behalf of the respondent after discussing the same with the respondent, but without having seen the notice to appear. Yet the respondent admits in his affidavit that he was served with the notice to appear, and he does not challenge on appeal any of the factual allegations or the charge of removability contained therein. He therefore has shown no prejudice based on former counsel’s admissions and concessions on his behalf, or counsel’s failure to object to the admission of the Notice to Appear into evidence. His remaining assertions similarly fail to establish that he was prejudiced by former counsel’s actions.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christian Pressman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: None
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, appeals the Immigration Judge’s May 5, 2011, decision ordering his removal from the United States. The respondent’s appeal, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security, will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. §1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2011); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
In his Notice of Appeal, the respondent alleges that his prior counsel provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel by not seeking post-conviction relief on his behalf. However, the respondent has not presented an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with his prior counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations she did or did not make, the respondent does not indicate that his prior counsel has been informed of the allegations leveled against her and has been given an opportunity to respond, and the respondent does not indicate whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of her ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 640 (BIA 1988). Additionally, as the respondent has not shown that, but for his prior counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, he would have obtained post-conviction relief, he has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, a remand is not warranted on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
In his Notice of Appeal, the respondent alleges that he qualifies for asylum and that the Immigration Judge did not give him the opportunity to apply for such relief. We disagree. While an Immigration Judge shall inform an alien of his apparent eligibility to apply for relief from removal, the respondent has not demonstrated that he is apparently eligible for asylum. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.11(b); Matter of Cordova, 22 I&N Dec. 966, 970 (BIA 1999) (stating that an Immigration Judge’s duty to inform applies only to forms of relief for which an alien is “apparently eligible”). The record reflects that the Immigration Judge inquired as to whether there was a reason that the respondent could not return to Ecuador and the respondent stated he wished to remain in the United States because his son was ill (I.J. at 3-4; Tr. at 22-23). In his Notice of Appeal, the respondent has not indicated that he is unwilling or unable to return to Ecuador because of a well-founded fear of being persecuted on account of his race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group or that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to Ecuador. Likewise, he has not presented an application for asylum (Form I-589). Accordingly, we will not disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to enter an order of removal in this case. The respondent’s appeal will, therefore, be dismissed.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: JUNIOR LAVERN GAYLE
File: AXXX XX1 056 - New York, NY
August 4, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Melissa M. Desvarieux, Esquire
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 3, 2010, denying his motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on June 16, 2010. The respondent has submitted additional evidence on appeal indicating that a visa petition has been filed on his behalf. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). The Board should defer to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493, 496 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500, 501 (BIA 2008).
 
On appeal the respondent contends that he has established ineffective assistance of counsel because his former attorney advised him that there was nothing that could be done and that there was no relief so his case was finished. The respondent claims that he did not understand that he had to appear for his final hearing before the Immigration Judge. He contends that he has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and if the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, are satisfied. See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent has not established ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge stated that the respondent had actual notice of his June 16, 2010, hearing because he was advised in open court on March 31, 2010, of the date, time and place of his next hearing. As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent’s former counsel did not advise the respondent not to attend his hearing, but advised the respondent that he did not have any relief from removal. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006) (court concluded that aliens had demonstrated that their counsel was ineffective in informing them that they did not need to appear at a hearing, but they had not met their burden of showing why they had not been diligent over a two-year period). The lack of any relief from removal did not excuse the respondent’s obligation to appear for his hearing. The Immigration Judge indicated the respondent’s former counsel did appear for the hearing on June 16, 2010, and waited from 8:30 a.m. until about noon for the respondent to appear. See I.J. Dec. dated August 3, 2010, at 1. The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent has not shown with sufficient evidence that former counsel acted ineffectively to the respondent. We therefore find no reason to disturb the decision of the Immigration Judge. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.

IN RE: ANTHONY M. KIMANI
File: AXXX XX1 463 - Chicago, IL

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Justin G. Randolph, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Musto
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on February 2, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision. He has filed a timely motion to reopen premised on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes reopening.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations being leveled and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
It is also required that the claimant establish prejudice as a result of the attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). To establish prejudice, an alien must show that it is likely that the alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
In this case, the parties dispute whether the respondent has complied with the second procedural requirement in Lozada, namely, that he notify his former counsel of the allegations and give counsel an opportunity to respond. However, we need not decide this question, because we find that the respondent is not able to demonstrate prejudice.
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was ineligible for adjustment of status due to his inadmissibility under section 212(a)(10)(D) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(10)(D), for having voted in the United States in violation of any law (I.J. at 4). In the affidavit accompanying his motion to reopen, the respondent states that he voted in “the 2004 election,” and the record demonstrates that this was the federal general election in November of 2004 (I.J. at 4; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tabs 1 & 14; Exh. 3 at 8).
 
*2 With narrow exceptions not applicable here, aliens are prohibited by federal statute from voting in federal elections. 18 U.S.C. § 611. This statute defines a crime of general intent, which requires proof that a violator “knowingly engaged in the conduct prohibited by” the statute, regardless of whether the violator knew that the conduct was illegal. See United States v. Knight, 490 F.3d 1268, 1270-71 (11th Cir. 2007); see also Dixon v. United States, 548 U.S. 1, 5 (2006) (holding that “unless the text of the statute dictates a different result, the term ‘knowingly’ merely requires proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense”) (citations omitted). The respondent admits that he knowingly voted in an election, and that he knew he was not then a citizen. This conduct is sufficient for conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 611. Accordingly, the respondent is inadmissible under section 212(a)(10)(D) of the Act, for which no waiver is available, and he has not demonstrated prejudice sufficient to reopen his case based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Karl H. Goodman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brian M. Fish
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s April 6, 2011, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings, which were conducted in absentia on February 2, 2011, under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), after the respondent failed to appear. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposed the respondent’s motion and his appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent was removed from the United States subsequent to the taking of the appeal in these proceedings.¿FN1º This departure results in the withdrawal of this appeal, and the initial decision of the Immigration Judge is accordingly final to the same extent as though no appeal had been taken. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.4. However, even if the respondent’s removal did not result in the withdrawal of his appeal, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent received proper notice of his hearing date and did not establish that exceptional circumstances excused his failure to appear at his removal hearing.
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 723 (BIA 1999).
 
The hearing notice, dated December 8, 2010, shows that both the respondent and his prior counsel received personal service of the notice. See Matter of Munoz-Santos, 20 I&N Dec. 205, 206 (BIA 1990) (holding that there is sufficient proof of proper service if the evidence shows that the notice of hearing was personally served on the alien); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the alien); section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(b).
 
*2 The respondent argues that his failure to appear at his removal hearing was due to exceptional circumstances.¿FN2º In his appeal brief, the respondent asserts that he mistakenly believed that his hearing date was February 8, 2011, instead of February 2, 2011, because his English is poor and he was not provided with an Arabic translator at any of his hearings. However, in his motion to reopen, the respondent asserted that he was confused as to the correct date because the Arabic pronunciation of 8 and 2 is similar. These two explanations are inconsistent. Consequently, he has not demonstrated that he failed to appear due to exceptional circumstances. The term “exceptional circumstances” is defined by the Act as “exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” Section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). For the foregoing reasons, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

To the extent that the respondent argues that his prior counsel’s withdrawal from the case foreclosed a pre-hearing meeting where the correct hearing date would have been discussed, we reiterate that the record shows that the respondent was personally served with the hearing notice. In any event, the respondent has neither meaningfully asserted a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his prior attorney nor complied with the procedural requirements in making such a claim.

File: AXXX XX2 838 - Phoenix, AZ
July 21, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thomas A. Lappin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Amy C. Martin
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In a decision dated August 26, 2010, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and granted him voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a) (pre-conclusion voluntary departure). He did not depart, but instead filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge prior to the expiration of his voluntary departure period claiming ineffective assistance of counsel by his former attorney, and arguing in favor of his eligibility for cancellation of removal as well as his potential eligibility for relief under “the DREAM Act.”
 
On January 14, 2011, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely, and noted in part that he failed to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent appealed and filed an appellate brief with this Board. He also requested a stay of removal, which was denied June 9, 2011. He was removed the same day.¿FN1º
 
Inasmuch as the respondent was removed from the United States, his appeal is deemed withdrawn. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.4. Alternatively, we would dismiss his appeal. The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely. Indeed, the respondent conceded this point. Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 3; Brief on Appeal (Brief) at 3. On appeal, he continues to assert that the filing deadline of his motion should be equitably tolled because his conviction does not provide a proper basis for his removal.¿FN2º Brief at 3-4. However, pursuant to the statute and regulations, a motion to reopen may only be excused under very limited circumstances, none of which are presented in this case. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23 (regarding reopening requests before the Immigration Judge) and 1003.2(c) (regarding motions to reopen before the Board).
 
Although the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that the time restrictions governing the filing of motions to reopen may be equitably tolled under certain circumstances in cases involving a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, no such circumstances have been demonstrated here. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent offered no explanation for the late filing of his motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge.¿FN3º There also was no showing that he was prevented from timely filing his motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge because of deception, fraud, or error.
 
*2 Thus, the respondent’s motion to reopen was correctly denied as untimely. His motion was also correctly denied for failure to demonstrate compliance with the Lozada requirements concerning the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that were made.¿FN4º As for sua sponte reopening, the respondent did not show exceptional circumstances warranting such reopening. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R § 1003.2(a).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

From the record, it is not clear whether the respondent’s removal was voluntary or involuntary.

2

The respondent’s removability is not premised on his having been convicted of a crime. Instead, he was charged with removability only under section 212(a)(6) of the Act, as an alien who was present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, or who arrived in the United States at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General. His removability on this charge remains undisputed.

No declaration or statement by the respondent was submitted with his motion to reopen.

The allegations of ineffective assistance against the respondent’s former attorney were advanced only by current counsel, not by the respondent himself. It is well settled that statements by counsel do not constitute evidence. Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980); Matter of Laureano, 19 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (BIA 1983), n. 2.

IN RE: JESUS RANGEL-REYNEL
File: AXXX XX7 737 - Tacoma, WA
July 21, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on January 19, 2011, when we denied the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen. On March 7, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider that decision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The respondent’s fee waiver request is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). The motion will be denied.
 
The motion to reconsider is untimely, as it was not filed within 30 days of the Board’s decision that it asks us to reconsider. Section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The respondent, however, urges that we should consider his motion timely, because he had submitted the motion on February 18, 2011, within 30 days of the Board’s prior decision, although that filing was rejected on the ground that the certificate of service was served on the wrong DHS office. The respondent argues that the certificate of service was served on the correct DHS Chief Counsel’s office at 2500 Second Avenue in Seattle, Washington, because he is no longer in DHS custody. However, the certificate of service for the motion submitted on February 18, 2011, indicated that a copy of the document was sent not to this address, but to 29500 Second Avenue in Seattle, Washington.¿FN1 º Therefore, we are not persuaded that the certificate of service for the February 18, 2011, filing was proper such that the motion to reconsider should be considered timely. There is no statutory or regulatory exception for the 30-day time limits for motions to reconsider.
 
Even if the motion were timely filed and we were to address the merits of the arguments raised in the motion, we would still deny the motion to reconsider. In the motion, the respondent argues that the Board erred in the prior decision in finding that he had not shown due diligence in pursuing the ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his former attorney, Mr. Michael Jacob. In our prior decision, we noted that more than 2 years had elapsed between the Board’s dismissal of the respondent’s appeal on August 25, 2008, and the filing of his motion to reopen on December 1, 2010, and he had not shown that he exercised due diligence during this period such that his motion should be exempt from the time limits on motions to reopen. The respondent argues that he acted with due diligence because his case or cases have been pending at the district court or the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit during that period, and in fact his petition for review from the Board’s dismissal of his appeal was still pending when he filed the current motion to reconsider (Motion at 6-7; Motion Exhs. B, C).
 
*2 The Ninth Circuit has held that the 90-day filing period for motions to reopen may be equitably tolled when an alien is prevented from filing the motion to reopen “because of deception, fraud, or error” of the attorney, as long as the alien acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). Therefore, the pertinent consideration for equitable tolling is not necessarily whether a case has been pending for the alien, but whether the alien was prevented from filing a motion to reopen and pursuing the ineffective assistance of counsel claim because of deception, fraud, or error of the attorney, and how the alien acted with due diligence in discovering such deception, fraud, or error. In this case, the docket sheet for the respondent’s petition for review submitted in the motion shows that a motion to withdraw Mr. Jacob as counsel was filed on December 26, 2008, and the Ninth Circuit granted this motion on February 17, 2009 (Motion Exh. B, at 3). The docket sheet for the respondent’s petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington does not indicate that Mr. Jacobs was representing the respondent in this case, such that the respondent had a reason to continue to rely on his advice and assistance (Motion Exh. C).
 
Therefore, the respondent was no longer represented by Mr. Jacob as of February 17, 2009, and he has not shown that he had any reason to rely on Mr. Jacob’s legal advice or assistance since that date, or possibly since December 26, 2008. Nevertheless, the respondent did not show in his motion to reopen how he acted with due diligence since that time. Therefore, we are not persuaded that our prior decision finding that the respondent did not show due diligence in pursuing the ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Mr. Jacob was in error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
The respondent also argues that the Board erred in the prior decision in finding that he had not complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In our prior decision, we noted, among other thing, that the respondent did not support his motion with an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement he had with Mr. Jacob with respect to the actions to be taken. Matter of Lozada, supra. In his motion to reconsider, the respondent now seeks to “correct ¿theº shortcoming” in his failure to submit an affidavit, and has included a declaration in his motion (Motion at 3-6). However, the respondent has not argued, or much less shown, why his statement could not be submitted with his motion to reopen. In any event, a motion to reconsider is not a mechanism by which a party may submit evidence or legal arguments that could have been submitted earlier, but a mechanism to challenge the correctness of the decision based on the previous factual record. Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 57-58.
 
*3 In sum, the respondent’s motion to reconsider was untimely and, even if it were timely filed, it would not persuade us that our prior decision denying his motion to reopen was in error. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lynn G. Javier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals the Immigration Judge’s February 26, 2010, decision denying his second motion to reopen removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion to reopen and to rescind is number-barred (I.J. at 1). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). As for the respondent’s assertion that he did not receive notice from counsel, to the extent that he is claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, we find that the respondent has not complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Moreover, the respondent has not shown due diligence in pursuing his rights, as he was served with the Warrant for Arrest of Alien (Form I-200) in 1998, and waited over 10 years to file his motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX7 919 - Memphis, TN
June 7, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tom Travis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William A. Lund
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 1, 2010. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) urges affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in granting the motion by the DHS to pretermit his motion to suppress evidence because he did not file the motion by the court-imposed deadline. He asserts in his appeal brief, as he did in his response to the motion to pretermit, that his failure to timely submit his motion to suppress was due to a “paperwork blunder” by his attorney, and that the Immigration Judge should have accepted the late-filed motion.
 
The record reflects that on December 15, 2009, the Immigration Judge directed that the motion be suppress be filed by March 5, 2010 (Tr. at 3). The Immigration Judge imposed the deadline after the respondent’s counsel stated that he could file the motion by the March 5, 2010, date (Tr. at 3). The record further reflects that before the conclusion of the hearing on December 15, 2009, counsel confirmed with the Immigration Judge that the motion was due on March 5, 2010 (Tr. at 4-5). Given that the respondent had almost 3 months to submit his motion and the only reason stated for his failure to file by the court-imposed deadline was attorney error, we do not find that the Immigration Judge erred in denying an extension of time or in ruling that the respondent had waived his opportunity to file a motion to suppress. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29 (an Immigration Judge may grant a continuance for “good cause”); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (“If an application or document is not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that document shall be deemed waived.”).
 
If the respondent is seeking to assert that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to submit his motion to suppress by the court-imposed deadline, he failed to comply with any of the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).¿FN1º Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
*2 NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Cynthia A. Irvine, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert F. Peck
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
 
212(a)(2)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(B)º - Multiple criminal convictions
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 29, 2009, decision denying his motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal. The appeal will be sustained and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of the Ukraine who adjusted his status to that of lawful permanent resident in 1998 pursuant to section 209(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1159(a). On return from a temporary visit abroad in 2007, the respondent was served with a Notice to Appear charging him as an arriving alien who is inadmissible based on his multiple criminal convictions for which he was sentenced to more than 5 years imprisonment. See sections 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) and (B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), (B).
 
On September 15, 2009, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed due to his failure to timely file documents and to cooperate. The respondent filed a motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. He blamed former counsel for missing the filing deadlines and for failing to timely inform him of the Immigration Judge’s removal order. See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
On December 29, 2009, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion. He concluded, inter alia, that former counsel’s response to the DHS that “he would respond to the allegations when he was free to do so” meant that he intended to challenge the allegations that he provided ineffective assistance (I.J. Dec. 29, 2009, decision at 1). The Immigration Judge reiterated his finding that the respondent failed to comply with the filing deadlines and was generally uncooperative.
 
On our de novo review, we disagree with the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. He did not evaluate the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim pursuant to the Lozada requirements. We find the Immigration Judge’s factual finding that former counsel wanted to challenge the allegations, but could not, to be clearly erroneous. There was nothing to prevent former counsel from challenging the respondent’s allegations. Indeed, one of the reasons for the requirement that former counsel be informed of the allegations leveled against him is to give him the opportunity to defend himself. To date, former counsel has not responded to the respondent’s allegations of ineffective assistance.
 
*2 The respondent substantially complied with the procedural steps set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. In doing so, he demonstrated that former counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence and he that was prejudiced by counsel’s performance. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that prejudice is established when counsel’s performance was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings).
 
We recognize that the Immigration Judge gave the respondent opportunities to apply for adjustment of status before the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)¿FN1º and to modify his criminal sentences so that he could establish his eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), before the Immigration Judge.¿FN2º See generally Matter of Abosi, 24 I&N Dec. 204 (BIA 2007) (returning lawful permanent resident can apply for a 212(h) waiver without readjusting). Based on the foregoing, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The September 15, 2009 and December 29, 2009, decisions of the Immigration Judge are vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

The Immigration Judge acknowledged that he was without jurisdiction to adjudicate the respondent’s adjustment application (I.J. September 15, 2009, decision at 2). He was simply affording the respondent the time and opportunity to apply before USCIS. See generally Matter of Silitonga, 25 I&N Dec. 89 (BIA 2009). This may have confused the respondent who was eligible to apply before the Immigration Judge for a 212(h) waiver without an adjustment application. See Matter of Abosi, supra.

Although the Immigration Judge seems to state otherwise, section 212(h) of the Act can waive an alien’s inadmissibility under section 212(a)(2)(B) of the Act (I.J. September 15, 2009, decision at 2).

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Chandler B. Sharma, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joy Lampley Fortson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s August 28, 2009, decision denying his motion to reopen the decision dated April 8, 2009, which granted him pre-conclusion voluntary departure. The respondent also moves that the Board sua sponte reopen the proceedings and stay the order of removal. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility made by the Immigration Judge, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2011). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion to reopen was not timely filed (I.J. at 2). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (“¿aº motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal, deportation, or exclusion”). We further agree that the respondent did not demonstrate ineffective assistance of his prior counsel such that his case should be reopened. Even if the respondent met the procedural requirements for claiming ineffective assistance, described in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), he has not established error or prejudice. Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005) (“¿Iºn addition to substantial, if not exact, compliance with the procedural requirements of Lozada, a petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel … must also show prejudice.”). Prejudice exists “when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.” Id. (citation omitted).
 
The respondent argues that his prior attorney, Mr. Joseph Turner, inadequately presented his due process concerns to the Immigration Judge, regarding the automatic revocation of the visa petition filed by his mother on his behalf (Respondent’s Br. at 8, 18). Jurisdiction over the visa petition, however, rests with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the respondent acknowledges that Mr. Turner filed a petition for review of the revocation with USCIS. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Mr. Turner ineffectively presented the respondent’s case to the Immigration Judge. Rather, Mr. Turner’s response to the respondent’s complaint indicates that his request for voluntary departure was a strategic decision, in order to await adjudication of the petition by USCIS (Respondent’s Br., Exh. XIV). Subsequent dissatisfaction with a strategic decision of counsel is not grounds for reopening. Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998). While the respondent continues to assert that his visa petition was wrongly revoked, neither the Immigration Judge nor the Board has the authority to review the revocation or grant the newly-filed visa petition. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice.
 
*2 We also concur with the Immigration Judge’s determination that this case does not present exceptional circumstances to warrant reopening sua sponte (I.J. at 3). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Finally, we deny the respondent’s motion for the Board to sua sponte reopen the Immigration Judge’s decision. In accordance with our analysis above, we also deny the request to stay proceedings. The following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed, and the motion is denied.

File: AXXX XX0 502 - Oakdale, LA
May 17, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, filed a timely motion to reopen the Board’s December 10, 2010, decision dismissing his appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which is denied.
 
The respondent asserts that former counsel provided him with ineffective assistance by conceding the aggravated felony charge, rather than challenging the same (Motion at 4). The respondent has largely complied with the procedural requirements for such a claim. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 2005); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). However, he has not submitted any evidence as to his representational agreement with former counsel, nor shown that he suffered prejudice as a result of counsel’s actions, as required. Id.
 
In this regard we observe that the evidence before the Immigration Judge reflects that the respondent was convicted of “sale of marijuana” in violation of Florida State Statute 893.13, a third degree felony offense. Although the particular subsection of the statute was not provided, a review of the statute reflects that section 893.13(1)(a)(2) prohibits the sale of certain controlled substances, the offense of which constitutes a felony in the third degree.¿FN1º The respondent’s offense therefore is a controlled substance violation which qualifies as an aggravated felony offense because it is comparable to the federal crime of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. See Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 49, 53-57 (2006) (a state drug offense qualifies as an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(B), if the offense would be punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq.); 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (making distribution of marijuana unlawful); 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D) (a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) is a felony punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to five years).
 
Therefore, as the respondent was properly found removable as charged, the attorney’s concession to this fact did not serve to prejudice the respondent. The respondent provided supplemental evidence to his motion reflecting that a motion for post-conviction relief relating to one of his 1995 convictions, which are not at issue, was granted. This fact does not render the respondent eligible for relief from removal. However, it does call into question which conviction he retained former counsel to file a motion for post-conviction relief against. As there is no clear evidence regarding their representation agreement, we are unable to ascertain if it was the 1995 conviction, or the conviction forming the basis for the charge of removability. Moreover, there is no evidence that any motion for post-conviction relief against the conviction at issue had any basis in law or fact. Rather, it is unclear on what basis any such motion would have been predicated. Therefore, we find that the respondent has not met his “heavy burden” of demonstrating that reopening is warranted based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992) (holding that a party who seeks a remand or to reopen proceedings bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case). Therefore, the following order shall be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent has cited no support for his assertion that the sale of a controlled substance under Florida law “may be defined broadly to include “merely offering to ¿sellº” (Motion at 7). As such, his arguments in this regard are unavailing.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kelly Ryan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kathy Giraitis
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 8, 2011. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(I); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent entered the United States without inspection on September 16, 1997. On August 10, 2007, the respondent was convicted of Stalking - Emotional Distress. The respondent admitted the conviction. See Tr. at 29. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.41(d), 1240.10(c). The Immigration Judge found respondent removable for being present in the United States without authorization and for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. See I.J. at 2; Exh. 1.
 
The respondent indicated on December 28, 2010, his intent to file a U visa petition. See Tr. at 30. The respondent was thereafter granted two continuances. However, as of February 8, 2011, when the case was scheduled for final hearing, the respondent had not yet filed the U visa petition. See Tr. at 38. At that hearing, the respondent requested no other relief. See Tr. at 39-41.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying him a continuance. An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. Even assuming that the respondent expressly requested a continuance (which is not reflected in the record), we find that the respondent failed to show good cause for the continuance. The respondent had been granted two prior continuances, giving him more than a month to file the U visa petition, but he had not even filed the U visa petition at the time of the final hearing.
 
*2 Also on appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to advise the respondent of eligibility to apply for voluntary departure. We note that the respondent was represented by counsel between the December 28, 2010, hearing, and the February 8, 2011, hearing. However, the respondent, through present counsel, does not assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent may bring a motion to reopen if he believes he suffered prejudice as a result of his prior attorney’s ineffectiveness. However, he must comply with the prerequisites for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, supra; Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998); Matter of Grijalva, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Catherine E. Halliday-Roberts
Deputy Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), will be denied.
 
The Board issued a final order in this case on January 19, 2010. An untimely motion to reopen was filed with the Board on September 13, 2010. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision, which determined that the respondent was subject to removal as an alien convicted of a controlled substances violation, under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, and found him ineligible for relief from removal. Specifically, as the respondent was previously granted cancellation of removal under section 240 A(a) of the Act, he was ineligible for that form of relief. Section 240A(c)(6) of the Act.
 
The respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from an attorney, Katherine Owen, who did not appear at the removal hearing, despite entering her appearance on the respondent’s behalf. Respondent’s Mot.; I.J. at 1.
 
The respondent’s claim against the attorney could have been raised to the Board, as the respondent appeared as pro se on appeal. Moreover, the respondent could have, but did not, file a timely motion to reopen with the Board. DHS Opp.
 
The respondent also does not explain how the result reached might have been any different, had he been represented by counsel at the removal hearing. A respondent “must also show substantial prejudice by demonstrating that the alleged violation affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Id. See also Zetino v. Holder, 622 F.3d 1007, 1013 (9th Cir. 2010)(a showing of prejudice concerning an alleged due process violation “… means that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged violation”)(citation omitted); Dent v. Holder, 627 F.3d 365, 373 (9th Cir. 2010)(citation omitted)(same). The respondent does not make that showing in this case.
 
The respondent also fails to meet the procedural requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). DHS Opp.
 
The pending motion will, therefore, be denied.
 
ORDER: The pending motion is denied.
 
*2 FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Claire H. Kim, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christie Woo-Thibodeaux
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The final administrative order in this matter was entered on December 27, 2006. This matter was last before the Board on October 3, 2008, when we denied the respondents’ motion to reopen proceedings. On September 27, 2010, the respondents filed another motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
With certain exceptions, an alien is entitled to file only one motion to reopen and the motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Like the respondents’ last motion to reopen, the one before us is untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of the final order of removal. The current motion is also number-barred. The respondents now contend, however, that they have discovered that they received ineffective assistance of counsel and that the time limit on their motion should be equitably tolled.
 
The respondents assert that the attorney who filed the lead respondent’s visa petition, Robert Sklar, provided ineffective assistance that caused the visa petition to be revoked and that led to the respondents being placed in proceedings. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). They assert that they just learned of the ineffectiveness because the files showing the ineffectiveness were previously seized in a government raid. The specific ineffectiveness, they contend, was Robert Sklar’s failure to respond to the Notice of Intent to Revoke and request for evidence sent to CKM Industries, where the lead respondent worked.
 
The respondents have not shown that proceedings should be reopened in this matter. As correctly observed by the DHS, the alleged ineffectiveness involved actions that occurred before the respondents were placed in proceedings, not actions that occurred during proceedings. The respondents were not represented by Robert Sklar during their removal proceedings and the respondents have not shown that their removal proceedings were unfair. See Lara-Torres v. Gonzales, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004). Also, the respondents have not substantially complied with Matter of Lozada’s procedural requirements for ineffective assistance claims.
 
*2 Furthermore, the Notice of Intent to Revoke and request for evidence was not sent to Robert Sklar, and there is no reason to believe that he even knew of it. The Notice of Intent to Revoke was sent to Michael Yuhan, Vice President of CKM Industries, Inc. It was sent because Robert Sklar had previously committed fraud by obtaining labor certifications from the Department of Labor without the knowledge of the employers listed on the applications. According to the Notice of Intent to Revoke, Sklar forged the signatures of various employers and claimed that he was their representative. Robert Sklar also forged signatures on immigrant petitions. The vice president of CKM Industries was contacted by the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) for additional evidence so that the INS could determine whether the respondent’s employment based visa petition was part of the fraud. The Notice of Intent to Revoke stated that unless certain evidence were received from CKM, the INS (now the DHS) could only determine that the labor certification application and the immigrant petition for the respondent were filed without the employer’s knowledge or authorization, with no desire or intent to employ the beneficiary.
 
Robert Sklar would not have been the appropriate person to respond to the Notice of Intent to Revoke, even if he knew about it. Furthermore, the respondents do not assert in their motion that the vice president of CKM Industries, or another officer at CKM Industries, responded to the Notice.¿FN1º While there is evidence in the record that Robert Sklar committed fraud, there is not evidence that he provided the respondents with ineffective assistance of counsel. Given that the respondents have not demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel, they have not established that equitable tolling should apply to their motion based on their recent discovery of the alleged ineffectiveness.
 
The respondents have also not shown that sua sponte reopening is appropriate. Even if proceedings were reopened, they have not demonstrated eligibility for relief. The respondents assert that the lead respondent actually worked for CKM Industries, that the applications filed with respect to his case were all legitimate and that just because Robert Sklar filed fraudulent documents, it should not be assumed that everything filed by Robert Sklar was fraudulent. However, assuming the truth of the respondents’ allegations, the respondents have not shown that they have visas available to them. Accordingly, there is no basis for reopening for a hearing on their adjustment eligibility.
 
The respondents also assert that there is no DHS regulatory process for invalidating a labor certification that has been approved, as opposed to one that is pending. The respondents contend that because the labor certificate in this case is valid, having not been properly revoked, its “revocation” cannot serve as the basis for the revocation of the Form I-140 petition. We find no merit, however, to the respondents’ argument that 20 C.F.R. § 656.30(d) is not sufficient, without additional DHS regulations, to allow for the DHS invalidation of a labor certificate and subsequent invalidation of the 1-140 petition.
 
*3 To the extent the respondents seek equitable relief they must pursue that with the DHS. See Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734 (BIA 1988). This Board has no power to grant equitable remedies or to confer general humanitarian relief on aliens, even though a particular case may pose sympathetic circumstances. The respondents’ untimely-filed motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Barry C. Schneps, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Eileen McCrohan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; stay
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on July 15, 2010, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s June 1, 2009, decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1). On September 1, 2010, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen to apply for asylum in the first instance and to reapply for cancellation of removal. On November 1, 2010, the respondent submitted additional evidence in support of his motion (“Respondent’s Supporting Evidence”). For the reasons set out below, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material” and “must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). A motion to reopen “shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing ….” Id. Further, the movant must establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought, INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 319 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94,104-05 (1988); and satisfy the “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case, Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
As an initial matter, we find the respondent’s claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in the proceedings below to be without any merit (see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Attorney Affirmation). The respondent has not specified how his former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Also, statements from his current counsel in a mixed legal and factual affirmation do not qualify as evidence (see id.). See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183,188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Finally, the respondent has not complied with any of the Lozada¿FN1º procedural requirements. See Jiang v. Mukasey, 522 F.3d 266, 270 (2d Cir. 2008) (stating that a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel must comply with the Lozada requirements). We next address the respondent’s motion to reopen to pursue asylum.
 
*2 The respondent’s motion to reopen to pursue asylum will be denied. First, the respondent has not submitted the requisite asylum application. See 8C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Second, the respondent has not demonstrated that the information in his written statement regarding his alleged political activity and mistreatment in Nigeria in the 1990’s was unavailable or undiscoverable for his former hearing on June 1,2009 (see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Statement of Asylum). Although the respondent alleges that members of his political party are still mistreated and he is on a “radar” list (id, Statement of Asylum at 1, 4), he has not demonstrated that this is a material change in circumstances since his former hearing on June 1, 2009.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen to reapply for cancellation of removal will also be denied. The respondent has not demonstrated that the Certification of Health Care Provider, dated February 23, 2009, and the doctor’s notes and letter from 2008 and May 1,2009, respectively, were unavailable at his former hearing on June 1, 2009 (see Respondent’s Supporting Evidence, Tab 2). In fact, the respondent submitted the same May 1, 2009, letter from Dr. Lori Berman regarding his daughter’s asthma during the former proceedings (compare id. with Group Exh. 14, Tab D). Further, the background documents regarding environmental conditions in Nigeria were previously available and were actually submitted by the respondent at the former hearing (compare Respondent’s Supporting Evidence, Tab 4 with Group Exh. 14, Tabs I-K).
 
The respondent has also not demonstrated that the information contained in the IYAHO Service Plan was unavailable at the former hearing or represents a material change in his daughter’s condition (see Respondent’s Supporting Evidence, Tab 3). In any event, we give the observations and conclusions in this plan limited weight because we do not know (a) the qualifications of the individuals preparing the plan, and (b) the basis for their observations and conclusions regarding the respondent’s daughter’s condition, including the number of interviews conducted with the respondent’s daughter (see id.).
 
Finally, although not explicitly requested, the respondent has not shown that an “exceptional situation” exists that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte to pursue an application for asylum or cancellation of removal. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999).
 
Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion for a stay is denied.

IN RE: HAMILTON S. MARTINEZ-ARGUETA A.K.A. HAMILTON STANLEY MARTINEZ ARGUETA A.K.A. HAMILTON ARGUETA
File: AXXX XX7 743 - Los Angeles, CA
April 26, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert G. Berke, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen the Board’s January 28, 2011, decision dismissing his appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The Board denied his request for a stay of removal on March 6, 2011. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion avers that he paid an attorney, Sung U. Park, to provide him representation with regard to his first motion to reopen, and ensuing appeal, although both reflect that they were filed pro se. The motion is supported by a sworn declaration by respondent’s current counsel, who suggests that Attorney Park may have been providing “limited scope” representation of the respondent. Counsel states that, as such, he will not file a complaint with the state bar authorities until he has “received some communication from Mr. Park explaining his position” (Motion at 17). Counsel also states that while he has not notified Mr. Park of his “intent to file” the instant motion, he would do so “forthwith.”
 
We do not find that the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, nor is there clear ineffective assistance of counsel on the face of the record. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). It is settled law that statements of counsel are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Similarly, statements in a motion are not evidence. Id.; see also INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984). The motion has also not been supported by a statement from the respondent. As such, the motion is not supported by competent evidence of the facts alleged therein with regard to any alleged ineffective assistance by Mr. Park. Further, there is no evidence that Mr. Park has been informed of the significant allegations against him. These allegations include the assertion that Mr. Park wrote a “motion for late filing of Notice of Appeal” on behalf of the respondent falsely representing that the respondent was proceeding completely pro se, was ignorant of the deadline and requirements for the filing of an appeal as he was unrepresented, and was, in fact, then trying to obtain counsel (Motion at 10).
 
Present counsel has not adequately demonstrated whether a bar complaint has been filed and, if so, on what basis. Moreover, he has not provided a sufficient explanation for not ensuring that a complaint has been filed detailing the serious ethical breaches alleged against Mr. Park. According to the motion, the respondent believed that he was being fully represented by Mr. Park, rather than receiving some form of limited scope representation as present counsel now suggests. While one of the photocopied receipts from Mr. Park reflects that the respondent had paid for a “pro se ¿motion toº reopen,” the only other receipt with a memorandum indicates that the payment was for preparation of the respondent’s asylum claim and a court hearing on April 2, 2010. Although not mentioned in the motion, on that same date, the Immigration Judge not only issued an in absentia order of removal, but also issued an order granting a motion to withdraw as respondent’s counsel proffered by Mr. Park. Given that the respondent has not submitted any statement in support of the motion, must less submitted an affidavit “setting forth in detail the agreement with former counsel concerning what action would be taken and what counsel did or did not represent in this regard,” as required, we decline to speculate as to the basis for Mr. Park’s withdrawal, or to what services the receipts relate. Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 As noted, it does not appear that the respondent believed Mr. Park’s representation of him was “limited.” Absent evidence of notification of this claim to Mr. Park, and the filing of a bar complaint in this regard, counsel’s unsupported speculation in this regard is insufficient to support reopening. While present counsel has expressed a “belief” that the respondent’s family has “communicated with the state bar regarding this matter,” he has not explained this statement, nor provided any evidence in this regard (Motion at 13). Since the time of the filing of the present motion, no further evidence has been submitted evidencing any communication with Mr. Park regarding this claim, and/or that an appropriate bar complaint has been filed.
 
In sum, as the respondent has not satisfied the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, reopening is not warranted. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

With certain exceptions not applicable here, a motion to reopen must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed approximately 6 months after the Board’s final decision, and the motion is therefore time-barred.
 
Although the respondent requests the Board to reopen sua sponte, our discretion in that regard is limited to cases in which an exceptional situation is demonstrated. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). No such exceptional situation has been demonstrated. The respondent’s last motion was denied because the respondent had not complied with the requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims as set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent did not include evidence that a grievance had been filed against his former attorney. Additionally, although the respondent claimed that he sought to apply for cancellation of removal and withholding of removal, he did not submit the applications for relief with his motion. Thus, he did not establish prejudice from his former attorney’s failure to timely file those applications with the Immigration Judge. See id. at 640.
 
The respondent asserts in his current motion that he is prima facie eligible for cancellation of removal, but he still has not submitted an application. Thus, he still has not established prejudice. Furthermore, the applicable regulation provides that a motion to reopen to apply for relief must include the application and the supporting evidence. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent has also still not established that he filed a bar complaint against his former counsel.
 
In light of the factors noted above, the respondent has not shown that sua sponte reopening is warranted. His untimely-filed motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The request for a stay of removal pending adjudication of this motion is moot.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Randall L. Johnson, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Immigration Judge entered the final administrative order in these proceedings on May 7, 2002, when he denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status, but granted voluntary departure and entered an alternate order of removal to Cameroon. More than 8 years later, on May 17, 2010, the respondent filed the present motion to reopen, which is both untimely and number-barred.¿FN1º See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion was not filed within 90 days of the Immigration Judge’s final order of removal, and the respondent filed a motion to reopen in May 2002, which was denied. We affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of that motion in May 2003, and subsequently denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider that decision in July 2003. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the current motion.
 
The respondent urges that the time and number limits for this motion should be equitably tolled because he received ineffective assistance of counsel from Mr. Patrick Tzeuton, an attorney who was disbarred in October 2009 and was convicted of conspiracy to prepare false asylum applications, immigration fraud, and obstruction of official immigration proceedings in February 2009 (Motion, tabs F-G). The respondent claims that Mr. Tzeuton’s co-counsel wrongly informed the Immigration Judge that the respondent was the beneficiary of an approved immediate relative visa petition (Form I-130) (Motion at 3, 11, tab B). The respondent asserts that Mr. Tzeuton erroneously filed an adjustment of status application based on that petition, which had been withdrawn, and failed to inform the Immigration Judge and the Board that the respondent was actually the beneficiary of an approved family-based fourth-preference visa petition (Motion at 3-4, 9-10). The respondent also argues that Mr. Tzeuton did not inform him of the Immigration Judge’s grant of voluntary departure, did not inform him of the Board’s decisions, and failed to reschedule an interview for the respondent and his ex-wife with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) (Motion at 10-11, tab B).
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has yet to determine whether the Board has the power to excuse an untimely, number-barred motion based on equitable tolling. Nonetheless, the Fourth Circuit has suggested that, even if the concept of equitable tolling were to apply, it is unavailable to a party who has failed to exercise diligence and demonstrate prejudice from the prior attorney’s actions. See Amegashie v. Gonzales, 188 F. App’x 226 (4th Cir. 2006); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
*2 We conclude that the respondent did not exercise due diligence such that equitable tolling should be found to excuse this untimely, number-barred motion. Although the respondent argues that he did not “fully understand what happened” during his hearing before the Immigration Judge and was not kept fully informed of the subsequent status of the motion filed by his prior attorney, the Board’s July 2003 decision was mailed directly to the respondent, and he has not provided a persuasive explanation for his delay of over 6 years before seeking new counsel¿FN2º and filing a motion raising his ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Motion at 4, 7-8, tab B).
 
Moreover, the respondent has not shown prejudice from his prior attorney’s actions. The respondent’s potential eligibility for adjustment of status did not arise until January 2008, when a visa number became available in the fourth-preference visa category. See Department of State Visa Bulletin, Vol. VIII, No. 114 (Jan. 2008). Because the visa petition approved on the respondent’s behalf did not confer an immediately available visa upon him, the respondent has not established prejudice from his prior counsel’s misstatement to the Immigration Judge in 2001, the filing of an adjustment of status application in 2002 based on his ex-wife’s visa petition, or the failure to inform the Immigration Judge and the Board of the approved sibling visa petition. Also, assuming Mr. Tzeuton failed to inform the respondent of his voluntary departure order, we find prejudice has not been shown as the respondent would not be found to have voluntarily failed to depart the United States under section 240B(d)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d)(1), if he was unaware of the order through no fault of his own. See Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87 (BIA 2007).¿FN3º
 
Finally, a motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status does not fall within any statutory or regulatory exception to the time and numerical limitations for motions to reopen. See sections 240(c)(7)(C)(ii)-(iv) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). We generally will not reopen proceedings sua sponte when an alien’s eligibility for relief arises many years after the Immigration Judge’s final order, and the respondent has not persuaded us that an exceptional situation exists in this case that warrants the exercise of our discretion to reopen these proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

File: AXXX XX2 960 - Oklahoma City, OK

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
H. Glenn Fogle, Jr., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cynthia D. Goodman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 10, 2010. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable based on his criminal convictions and denied a request for a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(I); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On June 1, 1995, the respondent was convicted of Possession with Intent to Distribute Marijuana, in violation of Louisiana law. On June 25, 2008, the respondent was convicted of Felon in Possession of a Firearm in violation of Louisiana law. A record of each of these convictions was entered into the record of proceedings. See Exhs. 3, 4. See also 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41(a). In addition, the respondent admitted the convictions. See Tr. at 8. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.41(d), 1240.10(c).
 
The respondent was charged with being removable for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation, an aggravated felony relating to illicit trafficking in a controlled substance, and a firearms violation. See Exh. 1. The respondent, through counsel, conceded removability. See Tr. at 8. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged. See I.J. at 2.
 
At the hearing, the respondent requested a continuance of the proceedings to collaterally attack his conviction. See Tr. at 3-6, 27-28. The Immigration Judge denied that motion. See I.J. at 3-4. The respondent requested no other relief. See Tr. at 28; I.J. at 3.
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that, before the Immigration Judge, he requested a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1995). He requests remand to enable the respondent to be considered for that relief. However, as previously noted, the respondent requested no relief other than a continuance. Moreover, we note that the respondent does not assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.¿FN1º See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent may bring a motion to reopen if he believes he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. However, he must comply with the prerequisites for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, supra; Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998); Matter of Grijalva, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David R. Fletcher, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James E. M. Craig
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision, dated July 23, 2009, denying his motion to terminate proceedings and ordering him removed from the United States to the Dominican Republic. The respondent also filed a motion to remand. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes a remand. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion will be denied.
 
We review findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, under a clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic who was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1965. He is charged with removability under section 237(a)(2)(E)(ii), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(ii), in relation to violations of a protection order in 2003. The respondent, with the assistance of representation, admitted the allegations in the Notice to Appear (NTA) and conceded removability. Based on these admissions and concessions, and considering that the allegations were corroborated by conviction records, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged. He also found the respondent not eligible for relief from removal, and ordered him removed.
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges the finding of removability. He asserts that the NTA refers to judicial decisions issued in Duval County, Florida, but that he has never been convicted in that jurisdiction. Upon review of the conviction records in the file, it is evident that the respondent was found to have violated a protective order in Clay County, Florida, rather than in Duval County (see Exh. 2). The documents otherwise track the information in the NTA, including that the respondent had been found to have violated an existing protective order on May 29, 2003, and July 17, 2003 (Id).¿FN1º Under these circumstances, we deem the inclusion of Duval County in the NTA, rather than Clay County, to be tantamount to a scrivener’s error, and that it does not undermine the Immigration Judge’s ultimate finding of removability. We therefore will not remand the record on this basis as requested by the respondent.
 
On appeal, the respondent also emphasizes that he will be pursuing, or may intend to pursue, post-conviction relief in the form of a collateral attack on his convictions. This however, does not affect the validity of his convictions for federal immigration purposes. See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992); Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996). We point out that the Immigration Judge gave the respondent several continuances to pursue post-conviction relief and at this juncture, there is no evidence that any motion has been adjudicated. The respondent also contends that the criminal attorney who was to assist him in getting his conviction vacated has been ineffective; that is, however, not something we could remedy in these removal proceedings.
 
*2 The respondent also contends that he suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel because his representative in removal proceedings conceded the removal charge even though he has never been convicted of a crime in Duval County. As discussed above, the record supports the respondent’s removability except for the mistaken county reference in the NTA. Under the circumstances, we do not find that counsel’s failure to address this error amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, the respondent has not shown prejudice from the alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 640 (BIA 1988). This is because but for the scrivener’s error, the record supports the finding of removability and the respondent has not satisfactorily explained how the result in this case would change if the proceedings were remanded. We additionally are not convinced by the respondent’s argument that his former counsel was ineffective in assisting him in getting his criminal convictions vacated for immigration purposes. In any event, without persuasive evidence that the 2003 convictions would have been vacated in a timely manner for purposes recognized by the immigration law, we cannot discern any prejudice.
 
The respondent makes no arguments on appeal concerning the Immigration Judge’s finding that he could not establish eligibility from relief from removal. Accordingly, those matters will not be further addressed. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion to remand will be denied.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed, and the motion to remand is denied.

We note that on appeal, the respondent has submitted a Register of Actions from Clay County to show that the July 17, 2003, judgment relates only to the failure to pay a fine. See Resp.’s Appeal Exh. F; cf. Exh. 2. Even if no violation of a protective order was found on this date, the record would still support removability based upon the May 29, 2003, conviction.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ozlem B. Barnard
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1127(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Cuba, has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated August 12, 2010. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s July 29, 2010, motion to reopen the record of proceeding. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is subject to an administratively final order of removal entered on March 13, 2003. Thus, the respondent’s motion to reopen, filed over 7 years after the expiration of the 90-day filing period, is time-barred. See section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (2010); see also Abdi v. Attorney General of the United States, 430 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir. 2005). To the extent the respondent seeks to equitably toll the filing deadline under a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not complied with any of the procedural or substantive requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). To the extent he seeks to apply for relief from removal under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c)(1993), the respondent was convicted of the underlying aggravated felony on June 18, 1993, after a trial, as opposed to a guilty plea agreement. Thus, he does not come under the class of aliens contemplated in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001) (Respondent’s Motion To Reopen at 3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(h)(1); see also Ferguson v. United States Attorney General, 563 F.3d 1254, 1271 (11th Cir. 2009) (“Joining the majority of circuits, we decline to extend St. Cyr to aliens who were convicted after a trial because such aliens’ decisions to go to trial do not satisfy St. Cyr’s reliance requirement. Therefore, § 212(c) relief is not available to such aliens.” (footnote and citations omitted)). And, to the extent he seeks to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, his aggravated felony conviction renders him ineligible for this form of relief. Finally, the respondent has not supported the motion to reopen with an application for any form of relief from removal.¿FN1º
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We note that the respondent’s allegation of error relating to the form of the Immigration Judge’s decision is without merit (Respondent’s Br. at 5). The conditions pertaining to “summary decisions” under 8 C.F.R. § 1240.12(b) relate to decisions issued at the conclusion of the removal proceeding, not to a subsequent decision denying a manifestly non-meritorious motion to reopen.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se¿FN1º
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on July 9, 2010, at which time a motion to reopen filed by the respondent was denied. The respondent filed the November 12, 2010, motion to reopen now before the Board alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The respondent has complied with the process requisite to asserting such a claim. See generally Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-640 (BIA 1988). The respondent has provided a detailed affidavit describing the claimed ineffective assistance of counsel, has notified counsel and the bar authorities of the claim, and counsel has not replied to the allegations. Evidence of record establishes that from 1997 through 2010, the respondent was represented by attorneys Michael Leavitt and Elizabeth Cohen, who, during that time frame were suspended and expelled, respectively, from the practice of law before the Executive Office for Immigration Review. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be granted and the record remanded for further proceedings to allow the respondent the opportunity to apply for any relief for which he may be eligible.

Marvin J. Muller, III

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s motion is untimely filed and number barred and has not been shown to qualify for any exception to the filing requirements imposed on motions to reopen removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, inasmuch as we reject the respondent’s lack of notice claim, the respondent has not demonstrated the required prejudice stemming from his former counsel’s alleged action or inaction. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Nor has he sufficiently complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). It is undisputed that the respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear. Further, the respondent does not dispute that notice of his August 20, 1999, scheduled hearing was not only properly mailed to his former counsel, but also properly mailed to him at the last known address he provided. Where a Notice of Hearing is properly addressed and sent by regular mail according to normal office procedures, there is a presumption, albeit a weaker presumption than that which applies to documents sent by certified mail, of delivery. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). Under the circumstances, the respondent’s assertion alone is insufficient to demonstrate that he did not receive his hearing notice. See, e.g., Joshi v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 732, 735 (7th Cir. 2004) (stating that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving, denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence”). On this record, the respondent has failed to show he did not receive the Notice of Hearing, which was properly mailed to the last known address provided by the respondent. Finally, we find no reason for further consideration of the respondent’s claim on our own motion pursuant to this Board’s sua sponte authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

** THIS IS AN UNPUBLISHED DECISION - NOT INTENDED FOR CITATION AS PRECEDENT **
 
U.S. Department of Justice

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: GHASSAN SAED ALSALAYMEH
File: AXXX XX0 505 - Chicago, IL
April 12, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Omar A. Abuzir, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider the Board’s June 15, 2010, decision dismissing his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the current motion. The motion, however, does not allege or demonstrate an error of fact or law in the Board’s prior decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Consequently, it fails as a motion to reconsider.
 
Rather, the respondent seeks to submit new evidence, in the form of his affidavit setting forth his claim that his ex-wife admitted to him that she received the notice of hearing but deliberately withheld it from him (Motion, attached affidavit). As such, the motion is in the nature of a second motion to reopen to rescind the in absentia order of removal that was entered against him in April 2009, based on a claim of exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. Only one motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal is allowed. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) and 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii) & (c)(7)(A); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)& 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). As the current motion is the respondent’s second claiming exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear at the scheduled hearing, it is number-barred. In addition, a motion claiming exceptional circumstances for a failure to appear must be filed within 180 days of the final removal order. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. This second motion claiming exceptional circumstances has not been filed within 180 days of the April 2009 in absentia removal order. Thus, the motion is both untimely and number-barred, and will be denied.
 
The respondent’s vague allegation that his prior attorney never told him to provide an affidavit setting forth the facts supporting his claim that his ex-wife deliberately withheld the notice of hearing is insufficient to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim that might serve to equitably toll the time and number limits for this motion. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Parvaiz v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 488 (7th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

Board of Immigration Appeals
MATTER OF D-R-, RESPONDENT
Interim Decision #3708
Decided April 6, 2011
**1 *445 (1) The respondent’s deliberate omission from his refugee application that he was a special police officer during the Bosnian War, during which time he served in an entity that was part of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Srpska, could have affected or influenced the Government’s decision whether to grant him refugee status and was therefore a willful misrepresentation of a material fact.
 
(2) The respondent is removable under section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(4)(D) (2006), where the totality of the record supported the conclusion that he assisted in the extrajudicial killing of 200 Bosnian Muslims that his unit was involved in capturing, including evidence of his command responsibility, his presence, his platoon’s active participation, and the finding that he must have been aware that many other Bosnian Muslims who were similarly situated had been executed nearby several days earlier.
 
(3) An Immigration Judge may make reasonable inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence in the record as a whole and is not required to accept a respondent’s account where other plausible views of the evidence are supported by the record.
 
(4) An expert witness is broadly defined as one who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education and who has specialized knowledge that will assist the Immigration Judge to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.
 
FOR RESPONDENT:
Richard A. Kulics, Esquire,
Las Vegas, Nevada
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY:
Charles W. Baccus
Assistant Chief Counsel
BEFORE: Board Panel: GRANT, MALPHRUS, and MULLANE, Board Members.
MALPHRUS, Board Member:
The respondent, a native and citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina and lawful permanent resident of the United States, has appealed from a written decision of the Immigration Judge, dated November 24, 2009, finding the respondent removable based on conduct arising out of his service as a special police officer during the Bosnian War and ordering him removed from the United States to Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Immigration Judge found that *446 the respondent’s omission from his refugee application that he had served as a special police officer constituted a willful misrepresentation of a material fact, which rendered him removable under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A) (2006), as an alien who was inadmissible at the time of entry under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) (2006). The Immigration Judge also concluded that the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) had proven by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent “assisted, or otherwise participated” in an extrajudicial killing and is therefore removable under section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Act. Consequently, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States.
 
**2 The respondent argues that his omission from the refugee application was not a material misrepresentation and that the Immigration Judge engaged in impermissible speculation to conclude that he assisted in an extrajudicial killing. He also argues that he was denied a fair hearing because counsel in the proceedings below did not object to the DHS’s documentary evidence and testimony, and he makes other arguments that he claims warrant a remand or termination of proceedings. The DHS has filed a brief in opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained in part and dismissed in part, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge to determine whether they are “clearly erroneous.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2010); see also Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review de novo all questions of law, discretion, and judgment, including the question whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); see also Matter of H-L-H- & Z-Y-Z-, 25 I&N Dec. 209 (BIA 2010).
  
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The Bosnian War was a civil conflict arising from the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia. It was fought from 1991 to 1995 between the ethnic Serb-dominated Republic of Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was dominated by Bosnian Muslims. Prior to the war, the respondent served as a police officer for 21 years in the Republic of Srpska, where he specialized in training dogs to search for drugs and criminals. During the civil war, consistent with the Republic of Srpska Constitution, the Republic of Srpska Ministry of Internal Affairs police force, known as the “MUP,” became part of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Srpska.
 
During this time, the respondent was employed as a special police officer, and in the summer of 1995, he was assigned to the Special Police Brigade at the Ministry of Internal Affairs’ Jahorina Training Center, which was overseen by Dusko Jevic. While there, the respondent served as the leader *447 of the third platoon in the 2nd Company of the Training Center, where about 25 special police officers served under his command. His duties included being a dog training instructor and training police officers to secure or guard roads and regulate traffic. The respondent’s platoon and two others were under the command of Nedjo Ikonic.
 
One of the final major events of the war concerned what became known as the Srebrenica massacre, where, in July 1995, the Serbian forces took control of a United Nations safe area in eastern Bosnia and, over the course of 1 week, executed between 5,000 and 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys. To prove its case, the DHS presented expert testimony and documents from the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia at The Hague (“ICTY”) and the Bosnian War Crimes Tribunal.
 
**3 The documentary evidence, which the Immigration Judge found to be relevant and probative, included State Department reports, findings from ICTY trial judgments, and copies of real-time dispatch reports from field officers during the war that were seized by the ICTY after the war. It also included a 5-minute video compiled by the prosecutor for the ICTY as part of the proceedings in the prosecution of Vidoje Blagojevic and Dragan Jokic and photographic images from a video taken by an independent Belgrade filmmaker, both of which primarily showed captured Bosnian Muslims along the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road on July 13, 1995. See Prosecutor v. Vidoje Blagojevic and Dragan Jokic, Case No. IT-02-60-T, Trial Judgement (Int’l Crim. Trib. for the Former Yugoslavia Jan. 17, 2005), http://www.icty.org/x/cases/blagojevic_ jokic/tjug/en/bla-050117e.pdf.
 
The record also included MUP records showing the respondent’s service with the Special Police Brigade during the war. Richard Butler, a criminal research specialist with the DHS who formerly worked as a military analyst for the ICTY, testified on military operations that occurred in Eastern Bosnia from 1992 to 1995, including those specifically related to the Srebrenica massacre. The Immigration Judge found his expert testimony to be credible and persuasive.
 
The testimony and evidence showed that as the Serbian Army overtook Srebrenica and Bosnian Muslims fled the area, thousands were executed. See, e.g., Prosecutor v. Radislav Kristic, Case No. IT-98-33-T, Trial Judgement (Int’l Crim. Trib. for the Former Yugoslavia Aug. 2, 2001), http:// www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/tjug/en/krs-tj010802e.pdf [hereinafter ICTY Kristic Trial Judgement] (“As thousands of them attempted to flee the area, they were taken prisoner, detained in brutal conditions and then executed.”). Butler testified that when the Serbian Army overtook Srebrenica, the Commander of the Jahorina Training Center received an urgent message to secure the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road between Konjevic Polje and the village of Kravika, a key escape route through the rugged mountainous terrain for fleeing Bosnian Muslims. Butler explained that the respondent’s platoon, *448 along with others from the Training Center, arrived on the road on July 12 and stayed until at least July 19. During that week, they did not leave the area and even slept outdoors.
 
While there, the respondent’s platoon and others secured or guarded segments of the road and conducted joint “sweep” operations with Army troops and other special police in the surrounding mountainous area to secure the road and nearby area from escaping Bosnian Muslims. Butler’s testimony referenced a real-time field report in evidence, which stated that “two MUP companies [including] part of the forces for the Dog Breeding and Training Center [led by the respondent] have sealed off the area and are fighting the remaining Muslim forces from Srebrenica.” Butler also testified that between July 12 and July 18, 1995, many Bosnian Muslims surrendered or were captured along various segments of this road and that field communications showed that the MUP were almost entirely responsible for securing the road.
 
**4 On the morning of July 13, 1995, a total of about 1,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys (as young as age 15) surrendered on different points of the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road, including in the area of Sandici-Novici, which is the area of the road where the respondent testified that he and his platoon were stationed. Evidence showed Bosnian Muslims being induced to come out of the rough terrain by promises of food and water and humane treatment. Those who surrendered were taken to a warehouse in the village of Kravica, traveling in a convoy of dozens of trucks and buses on the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road that the respondent and his men helped patrol. At the warehouse, which was less than 2 miles from the respondent’s position on the road, MUPs shot and killed approximately 1,000 men and boys within 2 hours. Butler testified that they were then buried in mass graves.
 
On July 16 or 17, the 2nd Company Special Police Brigade under Ikonic’s command, which included the respondent’s platoon as well as two Army units from the Bratunac Brigade, were involved in a joint sweep operation that resulted in the capture of about 200 Bosnian Muslim men and boys and four young children along the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road.
 
Jevic, the commander of the Training Center where the 2nd Company Special Police Brigade was based, testified on behalf of the respondent by televideo. According to his own testimony, Jevic was responsible for having the men loaded onto the buses. Those under Jevic’s command, including the respondent’s platoon, loaded the men onto buses before they were driven away. Jevic said that it was his understanding that the men were to be taken to Zvornik and that he could not have known what would happen to them. Jevic also stated that he never ordered these or any other captured Bosnian Muslims to be killed. Furthermore, he said he had no knowledge that anyone under his command, including the respondent, ordered these or any other captured men to be killed.
 
*449 It is undisputed that none of the 200 who were captured were ever heard from again.1 According to Butler’s testimony, they were apparently killed unlawfully, probably in a manner similar to the men at the Kravica warehouse. Butler also testified that it was well known by the time these 200 were captured that mass executions of Bosnian Muslims were taking place.
 
Four years later, in June 1999, the respondent was admitted to the United States as a refugee, and he subsequently adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident in January 2002. The respondent omitted from his application for refugee status that he served as a special police officer in the Republic of Srpska during the Bosnian War.2 He testified that he omitted this information because an International Organization for Migration (“IOM”) agent who assisted him in completing his application told him that he would be disqualified for refugee status if he revealed his former employment as a police officer. The respondent argues that the evidence does not establish that this omission constitutes a willful misrepresentation of a material fact under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act.
 
**5 In addition, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge engaged in improper speculation to conclude that he “assisted, or otherwise participated” in an extrajudicial killing and is therefore removable under section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Act. The respondent does not dispute that he was present at the time the 200 men, all of whom he said were adult soldiers, surrendered to the police and military units that were there at the time, and he said that the Army took them away on the buses. He said that he did not know where the men were being taken or what would happen to them. He also denied ever hearing about the Kravica warehouse killings or any other mass executions of Bosnian Muslims while he served in the special police during the war.
  
*450 II. ANALYSIS
  
A. Material Misrepresentation
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s omission from his application for refugee status that he served as a special police officer in the Republic of Srpska constitutes a willful misrepresentation of a material fact, which renders him removable under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act as an alien who was inadmissible at the time of entry. Section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act renders inadmissible any alien who, “by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact, seeks to procure (or has sought to procure or has procured) a visa, other documentation, or admission into the United States or other benefit provided under this Act.” The test for whether “concealments or misrepresentations were material is whether they had a natural tendency to influence the decisions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.” Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 772 (1988); see also Mwongera v. INS, 187 F.3d 323, 330 (3d Cir. 1999) (citing Matter of Kai Hing Hui, 15 I&N Dec. 288, 289 (BIA 1975)); Matter of Bosuego, 17 I&N Dec. 125, 130 (BIA 1979, 1980) (stating that a misrepresentation is material if it “tends to shut off a line of inquiry which is relevant to the alien’s eligibility and which might well have resulted in a proper determination that he be excluded”). It is not necessary for the Government to show that the statement actually influenced the agency, only that the misrepresentation was capable of affecting or influencing the governmental decision. United States v. Matsumaru, 244 F.3d 1092, 1101 (9th Cir. 2001).
 
The respondent admits that he failed to disclose his former employment as a police officer during the Bosnian War on his refugee application but argues that it was not a material misrepresentation. We do not agree.
 
Todd Gardner, a Special Assistant with the Refugee Affairs Division of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, who is also an attorney and an expert in refugee processing, testified that failure to disclose police and military service during the Bosnian War would have prevented an appropriate line of inquiry regarding whether the applicant was barred from refugee status as a persecutor. He said that including this information would have prompted further questioning because of the human rights abuses that occurred during the war, although it would not have caused an automatic rejection of an application.
 
**6 Contrary to the respondent’s argument, the DHS does not need to establish that but for the misrepresentation, the respondent would have been denied refugee status. See United States v. Matsumaru, 244 F.3d at 1101; see also, e.g., Ali v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 443 F.3d 804, 812-13 (11th Cir. 2006). The respondent’s deliberate omission from his refugee application that he was a special police officer in the Republic of Srpska during the Bosnian War *451 could have influenced the Government’s decision whether to grant him refugee status. Accordingly, the respondent’s concealment constitutes a willful misrepresentation of a material fact, which renders him removable under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act.3
  
B. Extrajudicial Killing
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the DHS has proven by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent “committed, ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated” in an extrajudicial killing and therefore is removable under section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Act. This section cross-references section 212(a)(3)(E), which was amended by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-458, 118 Stat. 3638 (“IRTPA”), to make aliens who have committed torture or extrajudicial killings inadmissible to, and removable from, the United States.4 Specifically, section 5501(a) of the IRTPA, 118 Stat. at 3740, amended section 212(a)(3)(E) of the Act by adding the following provision:
(iii) Commission of Acts of Torture or Extrajudicial Killings
 
Any alien who, outside the United States, has committed, ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the commission of—
 
(I) any act of torture, as defined in section 2340 of title 18, United States Code; or
 
(II) under color of law of any foreign nation, any extrajudicial killing, as defined in section 3(a) of the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 (28 U.S.C. 1350 note), is inadmissible.5
 
 
*452 To determine whether the respondent is subject to removability under section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Act, the DHS must establish that he acted “under color of law” and that he “committed, ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated” in the commission of an extrajudicial killing. The respondent’s actions during this period were clearly under color of law. His service with the Jahorina Training Center Special Police Brigade in 1995 was under the authority of the commander of the Center, and under the Constitution of the Republic of Srpska, the special police answered to the military command during wartime. However, even if he had been a police officer who was not under the control of the military in 1995, for purposes of this statute, he would have been acting under the color of law in his employment as a police officer for the Republic of Srpska.
 
**7 The respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s determination that the DHS proved by clear and convincing evidence that he “ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated” in an extrajudicial killing. While the Act does not define the phrase “ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated,” the Attorney General has interpreted this phrase in the context of the persecutor bar, saying that “[t]he plain meaning of the relevant words in the statute is broad enough to encompass aid and support provided by a political leader to those who carry out the goals of his group, including statements of incitement or encouragement and actions that result in advancing the violent activities of the group.” Matter of A-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 774, 784 (A.G. 2005). The terms “are to be given broad application” and “do not require direct personal involvement in the acts of persecution.” Id. “It is appropriate to look at the totality of the relevant conduct in determining whether the bar to eligibility applies.” Id. at 785.
 
The United States Senate Report for the proposed Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act of 2003, S.710, 108th Cong. (2003), explains the role of command authority as a form of assistance or participation in persecution and indicates the intended broad reach of the legislation. S. Rep. No. 108-209, at 10, 2003 WL 22846178, at *10 (Leg. Hist.). The Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act of 2003 was not passed as separate legislation, but the statutory language from this bill was incorporated into the IRTPA, which was enacted into law. The report states that the proposed act was “intended to close loopholes in U.S. immigration laws that have allowed aliens who have committed serious forms of human rights abuses abroad to enter and remain in the country.” Id. at 1-2, 2003 WL 22846178, at *1-2. It further provides as follows:
The statutory language—“committed, ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in”—is intended to reach the behavior of persons directly or personally associated with the covered acts, including those with command responsibility. Command responsibility holds a commander responsible for unlawful acts when (1) the forces who committed the abuses were subordinates of the commander (i.e., *453 the forces were under his control either as a matter of law or as a matter of fact); (2) the commander knew, or, in light of the circumstances at the time, should have known, that subordinates had committed, were committing, or were about to commit unlawful acts; and (3) the commander failed to prove that he had taken the necessary and reasonable measures to (a) prevent or stop subordinates from committing such acts, or (b) investigate the acts committed by subordinates in a genuine effort to punish the perpetrators. Attempts and conspiracies to commit these crimes are encompassed in the “otherwise participated in” language. This language addresses an appropriate range of levels of complicity for which aliens should be held accountable, and has been the subject of extensive judicial interpretation and construction. See Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U.S. 490, 514 (1981); Kalejs v. INS, 10 F.3d 441, 444 (7th Cir. 1993); U.S. v. Schmidt, 923 F.2d 1253, 1257-59 (7th Cir. 1991); Kulle v. INS, 825 F.2d 1188, 1192 (7th Cir. 1987).
 
**8 Id. at 10, 2003 WL 22846178, at *10.
 
The cases cited in this provision indicate that there is a continuum of conduct ranging from passive acceptance, which does not meet the legal standard, to active, personal participation, which clearly does. See United States v. Schmidt, 923 F.2d at 1258 (citing Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U.S. at 512 n.34). See generally Matter of J-B-N- & S-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 208, 213-14 (BIA 2007) (discussing the particular significance of cases that Congress cited with approval in legislative history). These cited cases also make clear that one can be found to have “assisted” in persecution even if he has not “personally engaged in acts of violence.” Id.; see also Kalejs v. INS, 10 F.3d at 444 (stating that “assistance” in persecution is an independent basis for deportation, which “may be inferred from the general nature of the person’s role in the war, so the atrocities committed by a unit may be attributed to the individual based on his membership and seeming participation”). In light of this legislative history, we conclude that inadmissibility under section 212(a)(3)(E) of the Act is established where it is shown that an alien with command responsibility knew or should have known that his subordinates committed unlawful acts covered by the statute and failed to prove that he took reasonable measures to prevent or stop such acts or investigate in a genuine effort to punish the perpetrators.
 
The Immigration Judge made reasonable inferences from the totality of the record to conclude that the respondent assisted in the commission of extrajudicial killings because he knew that the 200 Bosnian Muslims would be killed unlawfully, and even if he did not, he should have known that they would. We find no clear error in these factual findings. See Matter of J-B-N& S-M-, 24 I&N Dec. at 215 (finding no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s fact-finding as to the persecutors’ motive); Matter of S-P-, 21 I&N Dec. 486, 489-90 (BIA 1996) (noting that the motivation of the persecutor involves questions of fact).
 
The respondent argues that he did not know what would happen to the 200 captured Bosnian Muslims and that the Immigration Judge’s conclusions to the *454 contrary were speculative. However, the Immigration Judge’s findings were based on reasonable inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence of the record as a whole, not on speculation. It is clear that “rank speculation and conjecture ‘cannot be substituted for objective and substantial evidence.”’ Nuru v. Gonzales, 404 F.3d 1207, 1226 (9th Cir. 2005) (quoting Bandari v. INS, 227 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir. 2000)); see also Salaam v. INS, 229 F.3d 1234, 1238 (9th Cir. 2000) (noting that factual findings cannot be based on an “unsupported assumption”). However, an “inference is not a suspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists on the basis of another fact that is known to exist.” Siewe v. Gonzales, 480 F.3d 160, 168 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Bickerstaff v. Vassar Coll., 196 F.3d 435, 448 (2d Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)). An inference is not impermissible as long as it is supported by “record facts, or even a single fact, viewed in the light of common sense and ordinary experience.” Id. at 169. “Drawing inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence is a routine and necessary task of any factfinder,” and “[i]n the immigration context, the IJ is the factfinder.” Id. at 167.
 
**9 The Immigration Judge reasonably found, based on the testimony and evidence, that the respondent was aware of the Kravica warehouse killings before his unit was involved in capturing the 200 men and boys in question several days later. For example, the ICTY Krstic Trial Judgment, which was introduced as evidence in these proceedings, concluded that the Drina Corps Command “must have been well aware of the fact that the executions had taken place at the Kravica Warehouse” by the evening of July 13, 1995, given their proximity to the area and the noise and high levels of activity associated with the massive scale of the executions. ICTY Krstic Trial Judgment, supra, at ¶ 215. Butler indicated that it was implausible that the respondent would not have heard the mass executions, based on his close proximity to the Kravika warehouse. Moreover, an International Warrant for the respondent’s arrest issued by the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was also admitted into evidence, states that the respondent “knew that his subordinates took part in the execution of detainees at Kravica.”
 
Given that the respondent must have been aware of the Kravica warehouse killings, it was also reasonable for the Immigration Judge to infer that the respondent assisted in the unlawful killing of the 200 Bosnian Muslims that his unit was involved in capturing on the same stretch of road a few days later because he knew or should have known that they would face a similar fate. As Butler testified, it was well known at this time that Serbians were committing mass killings of Bosnian Muslims. While there is no evidence that the respondent ordered any extrajudicial killing, the totality of the record supports the conclusion that he assisted in such killing. This includes his command responsibility, his presence, his platoon’s active participation, and the finding that he must have been aware that mass killings of other similarly *455 situated Bosnian Muslims were ongoing at this time, particularly the nearby mass execution at the Kravica warehouse several days earlier.
 
The Immigration Judge was not required to credit the respondent’s wholesale denial of any knowledge or culpability related to the mass executions of Bosnian Muslims captured on the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road.6 She did not commit clear error in crediting the version of events that the DHS presented through expert testimony and documentary evidence. An Immigration Judge is not required to accept a respondent’s assertions, even if plausible, where there are other permissible views of the evidence based on the record. See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985) ( “Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.”); see also Blanco v. Mukasey, 518 F.3d 714, 721 (9th Cir. 2008) (finding that it was not error for the Immigration Judge to reject the applicant’s plausible account of the circumstances based on contrary evidence); Don v. Gonzales, 476 F.3d 738, 744 (9th Cir. 2007) (stating that the Immigration Judge is not required to interpret the evidence in the manner advocated by the applicant).
 
**10 The Immigration Judge reasonably rejected the respondent’s claims of “ignorance” about the circumstances, finding that his testimony “was contradicted on multiple occasions by the testimony of other witnesses and the documents.” For example, the respondent testified that he was not aware of any mass executions taking place while he was involved in guarding and patrolling the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road and claimed that he had never heard of the Kravica warehouse killings. However, Butler testified that it was not plausible that the respondent would have been unaware of the Kravica warehouse killings at the time they happened. The respondent claimed that he and his men were stationed on the road for only 3 or 4 days on dates that he could not remember, while Butler testified that they were there from July 12 until at least July 19.
 
The respondent also claimed his platoon’s only interaction with Bosnian Muslims was upon the surrender of the 100 to 200 men, that he never saw buses travel along the road other than the three buses for these men, and that when his platoon was involved in joint sweep operations, they were not looking for “anything specific.” However, Butler testified that there was much traffic on the road during this period, including on July 12 and 13 when thousands of women and children who had been taken out of Srebrenica after *456 being separated from men and boys were transported along this road in dozens of convoys of buses. In addition, Jevic testified in a transcribed interview for the ICTY, which was included in the record in this case, that the respondent’s platoon encountered dead Bosnian Muslims while conducting sweep operations along the Bratunac-Konjevic Polje road on July 16 and 17.7 Jevic also indicated that the purpose of the sweep operations was to find escaping Bosnian Muslims.
 
The need for a fact-finder to consider both direct and circumstantial evidence in the persecutor bar context is well established. See, e.g., INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 483-84 (1992) (holding that persecutors’ motives may be established by direct or circumstantial evidence). It is often the case that there is not direct evidence that the respondent persecuted anyone, in part because of the lack of victim witnesses. See Kalejs v. INS, 10 F.3d at 444. The fact-finding in the persecutor bar context is analogous to the fact-finding in the context of extrajudicial killing. Also, contrary to the respondent’s assertions, the evidence here establishes more than a simple case of men dying incident to the military objectives inherent in a civil war. Instead, many men and boys who surrendered, often under the guise of humane treatment, were captured and later executed. Moreover, the respondent does not claim to have even asked what happened to the 200 who surrendered to his unit and others, at that time or any later time.
 
**11 Given the testimony and evidence as a whole, the Immigration Judge made reasonable inferences from the record to conclude that the respondent knew or should have known that the 200 men and boys would be unlawfully killed. Consequently, the DHS met its burden to establish that the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Act.
 
The respondent alternatively argues that the application of this ground of removability to him would be impermissibly retroactive. It is true that the conduct in dispute occurred in 1995, years prior to the enactment of the IRTPA in 2004. However, the IRTPA provides that the amendments to sections 212(a)(3)(E) and 237(a)(4)(D) of the Act shall apply to “offenses committed before, on, or after the date of enactment” of the IRTPA. IRTPA § 5501(c), 118 Stat. at 3740. Thus, his argument is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute. See Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, 548 U.S. 30, 37 (2006). In any event, “neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board may rule on the constitutionality of the statutes that we administer.” Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1035 (BIA 1999).
  
*457 C. Documentary Evidence and Expert Testimony
 
The respondent alternatively argues that the documentary evidence and expert testimony that the Immigration Judge relied on to conclude that he assisted in extrajudicial killings was “obviously inadmissible and unreliable evidence.” Even though his prior counsel eventually stipulated at the hearing that he had no objection to the admissibility of any of the Government’s evidence, the respondent asserts that the attorney’s failure to object to this evidence constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, deprived him of due process, and warrants a remand.
 
First, the respondent’s failure to object to the admission of the evidence before the Immigration Judge constituted a waiver, and the issue was not preserved for our review on appeal. See Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 261 n.1 (BIA 2007); Matter of Garcia-Reyes, 19 I&N Dec. 830, 832 (BIA 1988); see also, e.g., Torres de la Cruz v. Maurer, 483 F.3d 1013, 1022-23 (10th Cir. 2007). It appears that after initially making some evidentiary objections, counsel below made a tactical decision to focus his arguments on the sufficiency of the evidence to establish whether the respondent was involved in an extrajudicial killing, given his denials. See Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938, 942 (BIA 1995) (noting that “in the absence of egregious circumstances, an alien is bound by the ‘reasonable tactical actions’ of … counsel” (quoting Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 383 (BIA 1986)).
 
**12 As a general rule, to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent must satisfy the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In addition to substantially complying with these requirements, the respondent must also show prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, prejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s negligence, the outcome of the proceedings may have been different. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004). “To prevail, the respondent[] must show that the conduct of former counsel was so egregious that it rendered [the] hearing unfair.” Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998).
 
The Ninth Circuit has held that an alien need not strictly comply with all the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada when the record reflects a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 588 (9th Cir. 2006).8 The respondent, through new counsel on appeal, *458 seeks to invoke this exception because he has not fulfilled the requirements of Lozada, including affording prior counsel an opportunity to respond to the allegations and filing a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. We do not agree that ineffective assistance of prior counsel was clear and obvious in this case.
 
In immigration proceedings, the “sole test for admission of evidence is whether the evidence is probative and its admission is fundamentally fair.” Espinoza v. INS, 45 F.3d 308, 310 (9th Cir. 1995); see also, e.g., Nyama v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 812, 816 (8th Cir. 2004); Matter of DeVera, 16 I&N Dec. 266, 268-69 (BIA 1977). It is well settled that the Federal Rules of Evidence are not binding in immigration proceedings and that Immigration Judges have broad discretion to admit and consider relevant and probative evidence. Matter of Interiano-Rosa, 25 I&N Dec. 264, 265 (BIA 2010); Matter of DeVera, 16 I&N Dec. at 268; see also section 240(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(1) (2006); Navarrette-Navarrette v. Landon, 223 F.2d 234, 237 (9th Cir. 1955) (stating that “administrative tribunals may receive evidence which a court would regard as legally insufficient”).9
 
**13 The respondent argues that the DHS’s documentary evidence was inherently unreliable because it was not authenticated and there was no proper chain of custody.10 In the Ninth Circuit, official records and public documents from foreign governments may be authenticated either through the requirements of 8 C.F.R. § 1287.6 (2010) or through any recognized procedure, including the Federal Rules of Evidence. Vatyan v. Mukasey, 508 F.3d 1179, 1182-83 (9th Cir. 2007). The method of authentication that the party submitting the evidence utilizes may affect the weight of the evidence, and Immigration Judges “retain broad discretion to accept a document as authentic or not based on the particular factual showing presented.” *459 Id. at 1185. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, authentication “is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims,” and may be accomplished through testimony of a “witness with knowledge.” See Fed. R. Evid. 901(a)-(b)(1).
 
In this case, Butler testified specifically about how the ICTY seized records from the archives of military and police installations, noting his own participation in some investigative search teams and operations. He also discussed the ICTY certification process for court proceedings, including how documents were identified, catalogued, and stored. While he was not involved in seizing or storing specific documents entered into evidence in this case, he recognized the indexing and control numbers that were placed on them in the certification process. He specifically discussed various documents in evidence, including MUP records of the respondent’s service during the war, ICTY trial judgments, the International Arrest Warrant, the video, and photographic images from the video footage.11 In United States v. Vidacak, 553 F.3d 344 (4th Cir. 2009), which involved a criminal prosecution in Federal district court for false statements related to immigration documents arising out of the Bosnian War, the Fourth Circuit upheld the admission of some similar evidence based on testimony by Butler.12 Also, as the Vidacak court discussed, issues regarding authentication and chain of custody generally go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. Id. at 350 (citing United States v. Cardenas, 864 F.3d 1528, 1531 (10th Cir. 1989)).
 
The respondent also argues that his counsel should have objected to Butler’s qualifications as an expert witness and alleges that Butler’s testimony should have been deemed inadmissible hearsay. We do not agree. An expert witness is broadly defined as someone who is “qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.” Fed. R. Evid. 702; see also Thomas v. Newton Int’l Enterprises, 42 F.3d 1266, 1269 (9th Cir. 1994). An expert has “scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge [that] will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.” Fed. R. Evid. 702; see also Matter of Marcal Neto, 25 I&N Dec. 169, 176 (BIA 2010) (stating that Immigration Judges may rely on experts “regarding matters on which they possess little or no knowledge or substantive expertise”). Butler was clearly qualified to testify as an expert on military operations during the Bosnian War. Butler worked for 7 years with *460 the ICTY as a military analyst, specifically assisted in war crimes prosecutions, is a retired U.S. Army intelligence officer, and previously testified as an expert on the Srebrenica massacre before the ICTY at the Hague, the Bosnian War Crimes Court, and Federal courts in the United States.13 See, e.g., United States v. Vidacak, 553 F.3d at 347-49.
 
**14 Further, since Butler was an expert witness, his testimony would not constitute inadmissible hearsay, even under the Federal Rules. “An expert is permitted to base his opinion on hearsay evidence and need not have personal knowledge of the facts underlying his opinion.” Aguilar-Ramos v. Holder, 594 F.3d 701, 706 n.7 (9th Cir. 2010). Also, an expert opinion may include reasonable inferences that the expert draws from the available facts and data. See Fed. R. Evid. 703. Thus, Butler’s testimony was not inadmissible, and it was proper for him to testify as to his inferences from the facts in evidence.14 Also, his testimony was clearly adequate to support the admission of the DHS’s evidence in Immigration Court.15
 
Moreover, to the extent that any of the DHS’s testimonial or documentary evidence, such as the transcript of Jevic’s testimony at the ICTY, could have *461 constituted inadmissible hearsay in Federal court, this fact alone would not make the evidence inadmissible in immigration proceedings. Hearsay is admissible in immigration proceedings if it is reliable and probative. See, e.g., Kim v. Holder, 560 F.3d 833, 836 (8th Cir. 2009); Matter of Grijalva, 19 I&N Dec. 713, 722 (BIA 1988); see also Duad v. United States, 556 F.3d 592, 596 (7th Cir. 2009) (noting that any rule prohibiting hearsay evidence in immigration proceedings would be very detrimental to many asylum seekers). However, the hearsay nature may affect the weight of the evidence. See, e.g., Gu v. Gonzales, 454 F.3d 1014, 1021 (9th Cir. 2006); Chen v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 212, 218 (3d Cir. 2005); Matter of Kwan, 14 I&N Dec. 175, 177 (BIA 1972).
 
The Immigration Judge found the evidence presented by the DHS to be relevant and probative, and she properly considered it in making her factual findings. We do not agree that this is a case which involves clear and obvious ineffective assistance resulting from prior counsel’s failure to object to that evidence. Accordingly, we find no merit to the respondent’s arguments in this regard.
  
D. Interpretation Issues
 
The respondent next generally challenges the competency of the interpreter and properly notes that “a competent translation is fundamental to a full and fair hearing.” Perez-Lastor v. INS, 208 F.3d 773, 778 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Matter of Tomas, 19 I&N Dec. 464, 465 (BIA 1987). In such a challenge, the respondent must show both that the interpreter did not perform competently and that his hearing was prejudiced by that failure. Hartooni v. INS, 21 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir. 1994). The respondent has not met either requirement here.
 
**15 On appeal, the respondent quotes some passages of imperfect English that he assumes are based on inaccurate translations and a few examples of confusion in the transcript, such as where the interpreter asked the witness to repeat some of his answers and to shorten them to allow her to interpret them verbatim. However, the respondent has not cited specific examples of material testimony that was not translated or was translated incorrectly. In general, interpretations are more challenging when a witness is testifying by televideo, as was the case here. An interpreter asking for clarification or making a correction to an interpretation does not necessarily show that the interpretation was inadequate and may instead indicate an effort to be as accurate as possible.
 
Moreover, the respondent has not shown how “a better translation would have made any difference in the hearing’s outcome.” Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1139, 1144 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent has not identified where the Immigration Judge relied on incomplete or incorrectly translated testimony *462 in reaching her decision, and he has not shown that the outcome would have been any different, particularly given the Immigration Judge’s finding that the DHS’s evidence met the Government’s burden in this case.
  
E. Termination of Removal Proceedings
 
The respondent also seeks termination of the proceedings, arguing that the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction to address the issues in this case and that even if she did, the proceedings should be barred, because the respondent had been granted lawful permanent resident status more than 5 years prior to the commencement of these proceedings in March 2008.
 
The respondent’s contention that many of the underlying issues in this case involve international law and war crimes, over which the Immigration Court does not have jurisdiction or competency, is wholly without merit. Contrary to the respondent’s assertions, these are civil immigration proceedings whose purpose is to determine his eligibility to remain in this country, not to punish him for criminal or other conduct in his home country. See generally INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984) (noting that the purpose of deportation or removal proceedings is not to punish past transgressions and that “[p]ast conduct is relevant only insofar as it may shed light on the respondent’s right to remain” in the United States).
 
As discussed above, it is the respondent who chose to apply for and obtain refugee status in the United States and who was not truthful in the representations he made in that regard. The gravamen of these proceedings concerns whether he is entitled to maintain the privilege of the lawful permanent resident status that he later received in the United States. The Immigration Court clearly has the legal authority to adjudicate these matters. See section 240(b)(1) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.10(b), 1240.1(a)(1) (2010).
 
**16 We also do not agree that these proceedings are barred by a statute of limitations to revoke a grant of lawful permanent resident status. To revoke a grant of adjustment of status, the DHS can commence either rescission proceedings under section 246(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1256(a) (2006), or removal proceedings under section 240. See Biggs v. INS, 55 F.3d 1398, 1401 (9th Cir. 1995). Rescission proceedings must be instituted within 5 years of the alien’s adjustment of status. See section 246(a) of the Act. However, the Act places no such time restriction on removal proceedings, which can be instituted at any time. See Biggs v. INS, 55 F.3d at 1401 & n.3.
 
Contrary to the respondent’s assertions, the DHS had authority to initiate these removal proceedings, and a 5-year statute of limitations is not applicable. See Matter of Belenzo, 17 I&N Dec. 374 (BIA 1981). The respondent urges us to change our interpretation in light of Garcia v. Attorney General of the United States, 553 F.3d 724 (3d Cir. 2009), which held that a 5-year statute of limitations for seeking to rescind a grant of adjustment of status under *463 section 246(a) of the Act also applies to removal proceedings. See also Bamidele v. INS, 99 F.3d 557 (3d Cir. 1996). However, this authority is not consistent with the law of the Ninth Circuit, where the case at hand arises. See Garcia v. Att’y Gen. of the U.S., 553 F.3d at 728 n.4; see also Monet v. INS, 791 F.2d 752, 754 (9th Cir. 1986); Oloteo v. INS, 643 F.2d 679, 681-83 (9th Cir. 1981). We generally follow a circuit court’s precedent in adjudicating a case arising in that circuit. Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25, 31 (BIA 1989).
 
Moreover, we continue to view our longstanding approach to this issue as consistent with the overall statutory scheme and congressional intent. See Matter of C-T-L-, 25 I&N Dec. 341 (BIA 2010) (applying Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 866 (1984)). Removal proceedings are different from rescission proceedings and have greater procedural safeguards for the alien. Stolaj v. Holder, 577 F.3d 651, 656 (6th Cir. 2009). Furthermore, Congress amended section 246(a) of the Act to clarify that it is not necessary to rescind an alien’s permanent resident status before commencing removal proceedings. See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, § 378(a), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-649; Kim v. Holder, 560 F.3d 833, 836-38 (8th Cir. 2009).
 
**17 We are aware of no circuit that has adopted the Third’s Circuit’s view regarding a 5-year statute of limitations on the commencement of removal proceedings. See Garcia v. Att’y Gen. of the U.S., 553 F.3d at 729-31 (Fuentes, J., dissenting); see also, e.g., Stolaj v. Holder, 577 F.3d at 655-56; Asika v. Ashcroft, 362 F.3d 264 (4th Cir. 2004). Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that removal proceedings were properly instituted against the respondent.
  
F. Other Relief from Removal
 
Finally, the respondent requests that the record be remanded to allow him to seek asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted and opened for signature Dec. 10, 1984, G.A. Res. 39/46. 39 U.N. GAOR Supp. No. 51, at 197, U.N. Doc. A/RES/39/708 (1984) (entered into force June 26, 1987; for the United States Apr. 18, 1988) (“Convention Against Torture”), on account of his fear of criminal prosecution for war crimes based on his service during the war. Inasmuch as the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Act, he is statutorily ineligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and withholding under the Convention Against Torture. Sections 208(b)(2)(A)(i), 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(2)(A)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B) (2006); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.13(c), 1208.16(d)(2) (2010).
 
*464 However, the respondent is statutorily eligible to seek deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture, and the Immigration Judge did not consider this issue in the first instance. We will therefore remand the record to the Immigration Judge for the sole purpose of providing the respondent the opportunity to establish his eligibility for such protection. See 8 C.F.R. § § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv), 1208.16(c)(4). In remanding the record, we render no judgment on the merits of the respondent’s claim for protection. See Matter of Interiano-Rosa, 25 I&N Dec. at 266. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be sustained in part and dismissed in part, and the record will be remanded.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained in part and dismissed in part.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

In response to the question regarding his employment on the refugee application Biographic Information sheet (Form G-325C), which he signed in September 1998, the respondent indicated that from May 1992 to the present, he was “unemployed (part time jobs).” Moreover, on his refugee application, the Form I-590 (Registration for Classification as Refugee), which he signed in October 1999, the respondent indicated that his military service was only as a private in a Yugoslavian guard unit from 1970 to 1971. Later, when completing his application for permanent residence, the respondent answered “none” to the question about military service on the Form I-485 (Application to Register Permanent Resident or Adjust Status), although the Immigration Judge did not address any issue of misrepresentations on that application.

3

To the extent the respondent implies that his failure to disclose his service as a police officer should be excused based on the advice he claimed to have received from the IOM officer who assisted him in completing his application, we do not agree. “‘The element of willfulness is satisfied by a finding that the misrepresentation was deliberate and voluntary.’ The INS does not need to show intent to deceive; rather, knowledge of the falsity of the representation will suffice.” Mwongera v. INS, 187 F.3d at 330 (quoting Witter v. INS, 113 F.3d 549, 554 (5th Cir 1997)); see also Espinoza-Espinoza v. INS, 554 F.2d 921, 925 (9th Cir. 1977). The respondent does not dispute that his failure to disclose the information was intentional. We therefore conclude that the willfulness element has been met.

Section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Act was also amended by section 5501(b) of the IRTPA, 118 Stat. at 3740.

According to 28 U.S.C. § 1350(3)(a) (2006), the term “extrajudicial killing” means “a deliberated killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. Such term, however, does not include any such killing that, under international law, is lawfully carried out under the authority of a foreign nation.”

The respondent testified that when he saw Bosnian Muslims surrender on the road, “they would take off their weapons and put them together, and on the other side, [would put their] documents” before they were taken away in buses. Butler testified in a different context that, in general, the separation of Bosnian Muslims from their identity documents was common and was an indication that they would be executed.

When he testified in the respondent’s case, Jevic said that his testimony before the ICTY was accurate.

We do not intend to suggest that this exception to the Lozada requirements should be applied outside of this circuit.

The Federal Rules of Evidence, while not binding, may provide helpful guidance in immigration proceedings because the fact that specific evidence would be admissible under the Federal Rules “lends strong support to the conclusion that admission of the evidence comports with due process.” Felzcerek v. INS, 75 F.3d 112, 116 (2d Cir. 1996); see also, e.g., Malkandi v. Holder, 576 F.3d 906, 916 (9th Cir. 2009) (noting that while strict rules of evidence do not apply in immigration proceedings, the report in question would have been admissible under the Federal Rules); Matter of DeVera, 16 I&N Dec. at 270-71 (finding that a document was properly given full weight where its reliability was ensured because it fell within an express hearsay exception under the Federal Rules of Evidence).

10

The respondent also argues that he is not fluent in English, so the DHS’s documentary evidence was inadmissible because it had not been translated into his native language. However, no such requirement exists in immigration proceedings. Cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.33 (2010) (providing that any foreign language document must be translated into English to be admissible in Immigration Court). In any event, the respondent used a court-provided interpreter at the hearing.

11

One of the DHS exhibits contained a certificate of authenticity from the ICTY and a written declaration signed by the custodian of the records, which would have established the admissibility of this document without testimony.

12

While Butler did not separately reference every piece of evidence the DHS submitted, the respondent’s attorney later withdrew his objections to any of the DHS’s evidence, making further explanation of specific documents unnecessary.

13

An Immigration Judge who finds an expert witness qualified to testify may give different weight to the testimony, depending on the extent of the expert’s qualifications or based on other issues regarding the relevance, reliability, and overall probative value of the testimony as to the specific facts in issue in the case. For example, the fact that Butler was employed by the DHS and had worked for the prosecutor at the ICTY could have affected the weight that the Immigration Judge chose to give to his testimony, but it would not have made the testimony inadmissible. See Tun v. Gonzales, 485 F.3d 1014, 1027 (8th Cir. 2007) (stating that involvement in an advocacy organization may affect the weight of an expert’s testimony but is not an adequate basis to exclude it); see also Akinfolarin v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting that the reasons that an expert’s affidavit was found to lack reliability, which were held to be sufficient to exclude the evidence, could have alternatively been applied to lessen the weight the evidence was given after admitting it). See generally Fed.R.Evid. 702 (discussing relevance of the expert testimony, qualifications of the expert witness, and reliability of the expert opinion).

14

The Fourth Circuit has held that the foreign government documents that Butler testified about in the Federal court case were not inadmissible hearsay because they fell within the hearsay exception of Rule 803(8) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which concerns records and reports of public agencies.

The respondent also argues that Gardner, who testified regarding the respondent’s omission on his refugee application, should not have been permitted to testify because he did not process the respondent’s application and had no knowledge of the respondent’s case, other than reviewing his refugee application at the hearing. However, as a United States Government official with significant experience in refugee processing, Gardner was qualified to testify as an expert and to give an opinion as to whether certain facts, if known, would have influenced the Government’s decision whether to grant the application. See United States v. Matsumaru, 244 F.3d at 1101-02.

IN RE: HIMANSHU PATEL
File: AXXX XX3 862 - Newark, NJ

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Suresh H. Dalal, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)º - Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Section 216(c)(4) waiver; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of India, appeals the April 14, 2009, denial of his application for a waiver under section 216(c)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4). The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
The respondent became a conditional permanent resident of this country on September 11, 1998, by virtue of his June 20, 1997, marriage to a United States citizen (I.J. at 3). The respondent and his ex-wife divorced on March 30, 2001, leading him to file an application for a section 216(c)(4) waiver with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) (I.J. at 3-4; Exh. 2). On June 30, 2003, the District Director terminated his status, concluding that he married his ex-wife for the purpose of procuring entry into the United States (I.J. at 1-2; Exh. 3). The respondent subsequently renewed his application before the Immigration Court. The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent’s testimony, the testimony of his two supporting witnesses, and his documentary evidence did not establish that he entered into his marriage in good faith (I.J. at 3-10). See 8 C.F.R. § 1216.5(e)(2).
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that his former attorney provided him ineffective assistance of counsel and requests a remand for consideration of evidence that the attorney allegedly failed to submit. Specifically, the respondent asserts that he retained David K. Wenger, an attorney based in Detroit, MI, to seek reconsideration of USCIS’s denial of his section 216(c)(4) waiver application, and later to procure reopening after the Immigration Judge entered an in absentia order on October 19, 2006. He claims that Mr. Wenger lost the following documents that were included with his USCIS request for reconsideration: (1) affidavits of his ex-wife; (2) affidavits of his ex-wife’s father; (3) an affidavit of his ex-wife’s uncle; (4) an affidavit from another of his ex-wife’s uncles; (5) an affidavit of his father; (6) an affidavit of his ex-wife stating that she married the respondent in good faith; (7) an affidavit of the respondent himself; (8) copies of letters sent to the respondent by his ex-wife; and (9) copies of 1998 and 2000 joint tax returns. Moreover, once reopening was granted, Mr. Wenger engaged the services of Robert Frank, an attorney located in Newark, NJ, at the last minute. Mr. Frank was not in possession of the abovementioned evidence while representing the respondent during the final hearing.
 
*2 In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we held that a motion to reopen (or in this case a motion to remand) based on ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639; see also Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 133 (3d Cir. 2001). Here, the respondent has fully complied with these requirements.
 
It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640. In this regard, the respondent has submitted a copy of a July 6, 2007, letter addressed to him, in which Mr. Wenger admits that he misplaced the respondent’s Form I-751 (USCIS section 216(c)(4) waiver application) file. The record also contains multiple letters from Mr. Wenger to the respondent, in which former counsel calls attention to the pretrial deadline for submitting documentary evidence. The respondent further includes copies of emails that he sent to Mr. Wenger on March 6, 2008, July 2, 2008, and February 19, 2009, asking him to make sure the documentation submitted to USCIS would be available at his Immigration Court hearing. Finally, he provides copies of various pieces of evidence that were not filed in a timely fashion.
 
In denying a section 216(c)(4) waiver, the Immigration Judge emphasized the absence of documentary evidence of a bona fide marriage (I.J. at 8-10). Therefore, we conclude that the respondent has shown prejudice from Mr. Wenger’s failure to produce the pieces of evidence noted above. We will remand the record for the parties to submit additional evidence and argument regarding the bona fides of the respondent’s marriage to his ex-wife. The Immigration Judge should then enter a new decision regarding the respondent’s application for a waiver under section 216(c)(4) of the Act.
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The denial of a section 216(c)(4) waiver is vacated and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
George P. Mann, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeremy Santoro
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopen
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on September 5, 2008. We remanded the record to the Immigration Judge to reevaluate the respondent’s motion to reopen, which was filed following an in absentia order of removal. On October 1, 2009, the Immigration Judge denied the motion, and the respondent filed this appeal. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard, and review all other issues, including whether the parties have met their burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
In our remand order, we agreed with the respondent’s assertion that prior counsel’s failure to file an entry of appearance, and failure to notify the court of a change of address on behalf of the respondent, are facts that if established, would lead to a finding that the respondent was a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We pointed out that the record is replete with evidence of malfeasance by the attorney in question, which could contribute to the respondent’s credibility. We remanded the record for the Immigration Judge to assess whether ineffective assistance of counsel prevented the respondent from receiving notice of her hearing.
 
On remand, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent did not prove that counsel in question was actually retained as her attorney for these removal proceedings or that she in fact did not receive her Notice to Appear and Notice of Hearing. The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge committed clear error in her factual findings.
 
As acknowledged by the Immigration Judge, the respondent complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to support her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. There is also an abundance of evidence that the counsel in question misrepresented his clients in various immigration matters. The outstanding issue is whether in fact the respondent had retained this counsel to represent her in removal proceedings. We find that the evidence of record supports the respondent’s contention that this was the situation; the Immigration Judge’s finding otherwise is clearly erroneous. The respondent submitted a detailed statement explaining her relationship with former counsel, payment receipts and other documentation, and an abundance of evidence regarding the attorney’s malfeasance in other cases. Further, the prior attorney failed to respond to the respondent’s allegations against him, and did not appear in court pursuant to the subpoena issued for him by the Immigration Judge (see Tr.at 13,20-21). Under the totality of these circumstances, we find the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent did not establish that she had engaged former counsel to represent her in removal proceedings to be clearly erroneous.
 
*2 The respondent has otherwise met her burden to show ineffective assistance of counsel which resulted in prior counsel’s failure to register any address changes with the Immigration Court. The respondent can therefore not be charged with receiving proper notice of her hearing. We will accordingly vacate the in absentia order and remand the record for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The in absentia order of removal is vacated, the removal proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

IN RE: CECIL LEE WILLIAMS
File: AXXX XX4 048 - Lumpkin, GA
March 29, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen, to which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded, will be denied.
 
The Board issued a final order on January 7, 2011, concerning the respondent, who is from Panama. A timely motion to reopen was filed with the Board on January 28, 2011. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The Board on January 7, 2011, affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable as an aggravated felon and ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction. That is, on January 22, 2008, the respondent was convicted of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of a cocaine mixture, in violation of federal law. The Board also rejected the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his former attorney Glen Fogle, as the respondent failed to comply with the procedural requirements for making such a claim, and failed to show prejudice.
 
The respondent in his pending motion asserts that he has now met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
As before, however, the respondent fails to show prejudice stemming from the claimed actions of prior counsel. Dakane v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005); Matter of Assaad, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra. “Prejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.” Dakane v. U.S. Atty. Gen., supra.
 
The respondent faults Fogle for not telling the Immigration Judge about “the positive aspects of my life and the ties that I have here in the United States” (Respondent’s Aff). However, having been convicted of an aggravated felony, the respondent is not eligible for relief from removal for this reason, and Fogle committed no error in conceding this at the removal hearing (Tr. at 7).
 
The respondent also argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from his criminal defense attorney, and has filed a motion to vacate the conviction. This does not change the finality of the respondent’s conviction for immigration purposes, unless and until it is overturned by a criminal court. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154, 156-67 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996).
 
*2 The pending motion will, therefore, be denied.
 
ORDER: The pending motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

IN RE: RUPERTO TELLEZ-MEZA
File: AXXX XX9 217 - Seattle, WA
March 28, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Debra A. Morales, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathan Love
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on September 3, 2010, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s request for a continuance of the proceedings, and to grant the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS’s) motion to terminate proceedings. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings, claiming ineffective assistance from his former counsel. The DHS opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
At his hearing, the respondent was found removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act. In his motion, the respondent principally argues that his prior attorneys, Mr. Antonio Salazar, Esquire and Mr. Andrew Oliver, Esquire, failed to properly represent him before the Immigration Court and this Board, and therefore, inter alia, prejudiced his ability to apply for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a) of the Act. The basis of the respondent’s argument rest on two claims; both that his prior counsel did not pursue post-conviction relief in federal court, and that they failed to properly investigate his immigration status in the United States.
 
In support of his motion, the respondent has submitted documentation indicating that Mr. Salazar was disbarred in 2010. The respondent has also submitted an affidavit and a complaint against Mr. Salazar to the Washington State Bar, as well as photocopies of receipts indicating various money exchanges between Mr. Salazar and the respondent. Through current counsel, the respondent has submitted evidence that he filed a Motion to Vacate Judgment on October 10, 2010, in the Douglas County Superior Court, State of California, pertaining to his July 26, 2001, conviction for conspiracy for unlawful delivery of methamphetamine.
 
Among other arguments, the respondent argues that even though he hired Mr. Salazar, it was Mr. Oliver who represented him at the hearing. Without more, we can not find that this fact alone constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent did not object to Mr. Oliver’s representation at the hearing (Tr. at 1), and the respondent has failed to demonstrate any contract indicating the agreement he entered into with either Mr. Salazar or Mr. Oliver. Moreover, the respondent has not filed a complaint with Mr. Oliver or otherwise contacted Mr. Oliver regarding the parameters of his representation or to alert him to the current complaint against Mr. Salazar. Accordingly, we do not find that the respondent has set forth sufficient evidence, in accordance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to adequately craft an ineffective assistance of counsel claim regarding his prior representation by Mr. Oliver, Esquire.
 
*2 Moreover, a respondent claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show prejudice resulting from his attorney’s failure. Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1189 (9th Cir. 2004); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Even assuming some link between Mr. Oliver and Mr. Salazar, the respondent fails to make this showing. Inasmuch as the basis of his current motion rests on the alleged prejudice that he suffered due to his prior counsel’s failure to file a motion for post-conviction relief of his criminal conviction, he has not demonstrated that the Immigration Judge would have continued his case if such a motion had been filed prior to his hearing, or that the outcome might have changed were such a motion filed by Mr. Salazar or Mr. Oliver. The respondent’s counsel requested a continuance at the hearing so that he could file a motion to vacate the respondent’s criminal conviction “within two weeks” (Tr. at 5), but the Immigration Judge found no good cause for such a continuance because the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal would be denied due to the respondent’s inability to demonstrate that he was a lawful permanent resident (Tr. at 5).
 
The respondent argues, however, that his prior counsel failed to properly pursue relief from the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service’s June 11, 2001, termination of his conditional residence status and the denial of his Form I-751 waiver. He argues that if prior counsel had so pursued such relief, he might have been able to demonstrate lawful permanent resident status for purposes of cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act. We find this argument, at best, speculative. The respondent has presented no evidence in the current motion, or in prior proceedings, in support of his eligibility for lawful permanent resident status, and he has not indicated how he would pursue an appeal from his 2001 Form I-751 denial. Ineffective assistance of counsel is found only where the proceedings are “so fundamentally unfair that the alien is prevented from reasonably presenting his case.” Granados-Oseguera v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 993, 1001 (9th Cir 2005); Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent has not made such a showing; accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Khagendra Gharti Chhetry, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Maria Lurye
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on March 11, 2002, at which time we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal for failure to file a brief. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen proceedings on August 19, 2010. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The respondent requests equitable tolling of these regulatory restrictions, and argues that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel from his prior counsel who represented him before the Board. He states that in 2002, he paid Mr. Charles A. Grutman, Esquire, $620 to file an appeal, but that the accompanying brief was not filed in a timely manner. The respondent argues that, subsequently, Mr. Grutman did not pursue any appeals or motions from this decision, but instead advised him to file an adjustment of status application under the Life Act. The respondent argues that if Mr. Grutman had filed a proper brief, he could have, inter alia, preserved the opportunity to file an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, or should have, at least, filed a timely motion to reopen before the Board in 2002.
 
The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has stated that “¿iºn a situation where ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from having the opportunity to present his case for relief, the filing deadline for motions to reopen will be equitably tolled until the ineffective assistance is, or should have been, discovered by a reasonable person in the situation.” See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 171 (2d Cir. 2006); citing Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir. 2000); see also Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154, 157 (2d Cir. 2006). In this case, the respondent has submitted two affidavits. In his most recent affidavit, executed on October 27, 2010, he avers that in March of 2002, he could not find Mr. Grutman, and was informed by his replacement, Mr. Robert Kuhnreich, that Mr. Grutman had stopped practicing law. He states that Mr. Kuhnreich, Esquire informed him that he should “not worry about his removal order” and should instead continue to pursue his Life Act application. The respondent states that he expressed “displeasure” with Mr. Grutman’s representation, and that he ultimately hired Mr. Ronald Gill, Esquire to continue with his adjustment application. He indicates that his adjustment application was denied on June 13, 2007, and that he subsequently hired Mr. John Finnell, Esquire to counsel him. He asserts that he continued to complain about his prior attorneys, but that Mr. Finnell, Esquire told him that he did not have to “worry about the removal case.”
 
*2 Along with his affidavit, the respondent has, inter alia, submitted evidence that he filed a complaint against Mr. Grutman, Esquire, with the Supreme Court Appellate Division, First Judicial Department, Departmental Disciplinary Committee, New York. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), see also Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 153, 157 fn.3 (2d Cir. 2006). The respondent has also submitted evidence that he has notified Mr. Grutman, Esquire, about his complaint.
 
According to the respondent’s affidavits, he indicated that he was dissatisfied with Mr. Grutman during discussions with Mr. Kuhnreich, Esquire in 2002. He also indicates, in his most recent affidavit, that he was aware of the Board’s dismissal of his appeal in 2002.¿FN1º However, the pending motion was not filed until August 19, 2010. See Cekic v. INS, supra, at 170 (“no matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled”). While the respondent intimates that all of his subsequent attorneys failed to properly address his outstanding removal order, the respondent has not adequately explained why he did not file this motion until the receipt of his bag and baggage letter on July 26, 2010.¿FN2º This is so especially because, as the DHS argues in its response, the respondent’s appeal from the denial of his second adjustment of status application under the Life Act was apparently denied in 2009. Even were we to extend equitable tolling to the completion of this appeal process, the respondent still waited an additional year before filing the instant motion. In short, we find that the respondent has not demonstrated due diligence in presenting his arguments regarding Mr. Grutman’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127 (2d Cir. 2008).
 
The respondent has also submitted evidence in support of his applications for adjustment of status, cancellation of removal, and asylum and withholding of removal. Regarding the respondent’s adjustment application, he has now filed evidence that his United States citizen sister filed a Form I-130 on his behalf. However, the respondent has not submitted evidence that he is currently eligible for adjustment of status, or that he would be excepted from the regulatory time requirements for such a motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Regarding the respondent’s cancellation of removal application, the DHS correctly argues that the respondent does not have a qualifying relative to support his application pursuant to section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act. We also, similarly, find that the respondent has not indicated why he did not file this application at any time prior to his current motion.
 
*3 Regarding the respondent’s submitted Form I-589, we note that when the respondent conducted his airport interview in 1998, he indicated that he entered the United States “to work” and “for family” (Exh. 2). He also indicated that he had been residing in the United States since 1981 and that he had never been arrested anywhere in the world (Exh. 2). These statements contradict the claim submitted by the respondent in his recent Form I-589, and he has not explained why he failed to file an asylum application subsequent to his “flight from Pakistan” in 1981, or at any time prior to his most recent motion. The time and numerical limitation for motions to reopen do not apply to a motion to reopen proceedings to apply or reapply for asylum, based on changed country conditions, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); Malty v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir. 2004); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The motion must state the new facts to be proved and must be supported by evidentiary material. Matter of J-J-, supra. The alien must show a “reasonable likelihood of success on the merits so as to make it worthwhile to develop the issues further at a full evidentiary hearing.” Matter of A-N- & R-M-N-, 22 I&N Dec. 953 (BIA 1999). In short, we do not find that the respondent has presented new and material evidence which would support an exception to the timeliness requirements.
 
The pending motion will be, therefore, denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

In his initial affidavit, dated August 16, 2010, he states that “Mr. Grutman, Esquire, did not inform me what happened to my appeal.” However, in his response to the DHS’ opposition, the respondent filed his second October 27, 2010, affidavit, indicating that he and Mr. Grutman, Esquire discussed the Board’s 2002 dismissal. Specifically, the respondent states that the “Immigration Judge ordered removal and Mr. Grutman wrote me a letter asking to remit $620 for appeal processing fee but failed to file a timely brief in my case … BIA rejected the appeal at that time and Mr. Grutman did not advise me to file a motion to reopen the case. Instead he advised me to submit an application for adjustment of status under the Life Act.” Accordingly, it appears that Mr. Grutman did, in fact, inform the respondent of the Board’s 2002 order.

2

In so finding, we note that the respondent’s initial August 16, 2010, affidavit (and the respondent’s affidavit to the Disciplinary Board) indicate that he was “shocked” when he received his bag and baggage letter. However, the respondent has failed to explain why he was so shocked. The respondent states, in his August 16, 2010, affidavit, that he consulted his current attorney on July 30, 2010, and was told that he received a bag and baggage letter because Mr. Grutman, Esquire, “did not file to the BIA a brief on time as required on my removal case.” However, the evidence in support of his motion indicates that a reasonable person would have known that he was under an order of removal. See Cekic v. INS, supra, at 170.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert M. Birach, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Theresa Bross
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On September 17, 2010, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’ September 1, 2009, decision denying his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). On December 13, 2010, the respondent filed this timely motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The Board will grant the motion and remand the record to the Immigration Judge.
 
The Immigration Judge noted the respondent’s “considerable equities,” but also considered the respondent’s “significant adverse factors,” including his criminal history, and determined that the respondent did not merit the desired relief as a matter of discretion. See Immigration Judge’s Decision at 8-10. In reaching his decision, the Immigration Judge emphasized that the respondent offered minimal evidence to corroborate key elements of his claims relating to his residency, hardship, assets, and rehabilitation.
 
The respondent seeks reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his former attorney. He specifically argues that his former attorney did not inform him that he needed to prove that he merited the relief as a matter of discretion, and that she failed to inform him of the type of evidence required to prove that he is deserving of a favorable exercise of discretion. With this motion, the respondent has offered evidence of his compliance with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Sswajje v. Ashcroft, 350 F.3d 528, 533 (6th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent has also offered evidence that he earned income in 2009, and that he filed income tax returns in 2007 and 2008. Further, he has offered a letter from Yemen Arab American Center for Economic and Social Service attesting to community service, and a letter from the mother of this United States citizen children describing his character.
 
The letter from the mother of the respondent’s children reveals that the respondent became the parent of his third United States citizen child after the Immigration Judge’s decision. See Exhibit 6. In light of this new evidence, the additional evidence pertaining to the respondent’s character, and the respondent’s “considerable equities” as noted by the Immigration Judge, we will grant this timely motion to reopen. Accordingly the motion to reopen will be granted, and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the respondent’s equities in conjunction with his application for relief.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order.

IN RE: LILIA JUAREZ GONZALEZ
File: AXXX XX6 603 - Bloomington, MN
March 23, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brianna Zuber Green, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Daniel J. Pornschloegl
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On December 17, 2009, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States in absentia because she failed to appear for her hearing. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on April 16, 2010, and that motion was denied on April 29, 2010.¿FN1º The respondent filed a timely appeal from this decision. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). Upon de novo review, we find that the respondent has not established that proceedings should be reopened.
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he or she did not receive proper notice of the time and place of the hearing, or because he or she was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of his or her own. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
In her motion, the respondent maintains that she was not served with notice in the Spanish language. However, the charging document is not required to be provided to an alien with a translation in her native language. See section 239 of the Act. As the record reflects and as noted by the Immigration Judge, the Notice to Appear (NTA) was received by the respondent by certified mail as shown by her signature on the receipt. She admits receiving the notice of hearing (NOH). Given this record, we find that the respondent was properly served with notice of her hearing.
 
The respondent maintains that she was told by someone named Virgilio not to attend her hearing. She argues in her motion to reopen that the reason she did not appear for her hearing is because she relied upon the advice of Virgilio, whom she thought had legal experience.
 
*2 Ineffective assistance of counsel may be an exceptional circumstance warranting rescission of an in absentia removal order. Habchy v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 858, 862 (8th Cir. 2006). An alien asserting that ineffective assistance amounted to an exceptional circumstance must however fulfill the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d sub nom. Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Habchy, supra, at 862; see also Ochoa v. Holder, 604 F.3d 546, 548 n. 1 (8th Cir. 2010) (Lozada is “our substantive and procedural compass” in assessing ineffective assistance claims in immigration proceedings). The alien must (a) “support his claim with an affidavit alleging facts relevant to the ineffective assistance¿,º” (b) “inform the former counsel of the allegation and give her an opportunity to respond¿,º” and (c) show that he has either filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority regarding representation (i.e. the state bar association) or explain why he has not done so. Habchy, supra, at 862 (citing Lozada, 19 I. & N. at 639).
 
In certain circumstances, ineffective assistance of a non-attorney immigration consultant or notary can form the basis of relief in the context of removal proceedings. See, generally Albillo-De Leon v. Gonzales, 410 F.3d 1090, 1099 (9th Cir. 2005). However, it must be established that an alien suffered prejudice from the negligent advice of a non-attorney purporting to be a licensed attorney. See generally Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000) (an alien may be denied due process if he or she receives negligent advice from an individual who falsely purports to be an attorney); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). The alien must, however, establish that she suffered prejudice from the conduct of a non-attorney, she was unaware of the fraud, and she remained ignorant of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on her part. See Lopez v. INS, supra.
 
Here, although the respondent states that she believed Virgilio had legal experience (Respondent’s Affidavit in support of the Motion to Reopen), there is no evidence that he held himself out as a licensed attorney. Regardless, even if the respondent believed that Vergilio was an attorney or held himself out as such, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not satisfy the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra. See generally Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 514 F.3d 1224, 1225-26 (11th Cir. 2008) (suggesting that Lozada applies to ineffective assistance of counsel claims rendered by non-attorneys); Omar v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 647, 651 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding that the Board’s decision to deny the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim against a non-attorney immigration consultant based on non-compliance with Lozada was “neither arbitrary nor capricious”).
 
*3 Under these circumstances, we do not find that the respondent received what may be tantamount to ineffective assistance to counsel. See generally Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, 327 F.3d 892, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that there is a “crucial difference” between ineffective assistance of counsel and ineffective assistance of an immigration consultant); see also Singh-Bhathal v. INS, 170 F.3d 943, 946 (9th Cir. 1999) (concluding that the erroneous advice of an immigration consultant does not constitute an exceptional circumstance requiring reopening of the proceedings). The respondent avoided her hearing based on a non-attorney’s advice despite being notified to appear and of the consequences for failing to do so.
 
We note that the respondent has proffered a copy of Virgilio’s business card on appeal. We do not consider evidence first submitted on appeal; rather, we review the record before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 73-74 & n. 10 (BIA 1984); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988). Even if we were to construe the respondent’s additional evidence as a motion to remand, the respondent has not shown that this evidence is new and previously unavailable. Moreover, the card does not establish that Virgilio held himself out as an attorney. We therefore find that a remand is not warranted.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Andrew L. Friedman, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondents, natives and citizens of the Dominican Republic, are mother and daughter. On May 20, 2002, the Board summarily dismissed the respondents’ appeal for failure to file a promised brief or statement. Subsequently, we located the respondents’ brief which had been filed at the Board on September 8, 1999. On August 5, 2002, we vacated the May 20, 2002, decision as to each respondent. On August 22, 2002, the Board affirmed without opinion the results of the decision below and designated the Immigration Judge’s decision as the final agency determination. In a decision on September 3, 2009, we denied as untimely a motion to reopen proceedings filed only by the respondent daughter and declined to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings.¿FN1º A motion to reopen proceedings, filed on behalf of both respondents, was received by the Board on June 16, 2010. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondents claim that reopening is warranted based on ineffective assistance by Vina Fleisig, Esquire, their former attorney. This motion to reopen is untimely as to both respondents (filed more than 90 days after our final administrative decision on August 22, 2002) and number-barred as to the respondent daughter (exceeds the single motion to reopen permitted). See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). However, the respondents seek reopening based on equitable tolling of the time period for reopening based on the ineffective assistance claim.
 
On January 7, 2009, the United States Attorney General issued a decision setting forth standards for claims involving ineffective assistance of counsel, but this decision was subsequently vacated by the current Attorney General. Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). Pending rulemaking procedures, the Board was directed to “apply the pre-Compean standards to all pending and future motions to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, regardless of when such motions were filed.”
 
Aliens raising an ineffective assistance claim in a motion can have the time limits on motions equitably tolled. See Iavorski v. United States INS, 232 F.3d 124, 129-133 (2d Cir. 2000). Aliens seeking to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim must establish 1) that counsel’s performance was so ineffective as to have impinged on the fundamental fairness of the proceedings because counsel’s conduct was such that competent counsel would have acted otherwise; and 2) counsel’s performance must have resulted in prejudice to the aliens. See Romero v. United States INS, 399 F.3d 109, 112 (2d Cir. 2005), citing U.S. v. Perez, 330 F.3d 97, 101 (2d Cir. 2001). Under both Compean and pre-Compean standards, due diligence in pursuit of all claims has been required. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir.2006) (“¿Nºo matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled.”).
 
*2 We acknowledge that the lead respondent/mother has complied with the complaint requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Zheng v. U.S. Department of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46-47 (2d Cir. 2005). However, compliance with the Lozada requirements does not, in and of itself, warrant equitable tolling due to ineffective assistance. In the documents submitted in support of the motion, e.g. Exhibit D at 29 and Exhibit Q at 73, the respondents have not indicated when they retained current counsel and/or became aware of any claimed ineffective assistance. We find that the respondents have not affirmatively demonstrated that they exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled. See Cekic v. INS, supra; Iavorski v. United States INS, supra. Separately, we note that the respondents’ ineffective assistance claim is primarily based on failure of prior counsel to file any brief on appeal (Exh. D at 28; Exh. Q at 73). The Board previously acknowledged that a brief on appeal was submitted and vacated the May 20, 2002, decision erroneously dismissing the appeal for failure to file a promised brief or statement. Consequently, the respondents’ contentions that their prior attorney failed to file a brief on appeal are without factual foundation. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and request for a stay of removal are denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Shaheewa Jarrett Gelin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent is a citizen of Honduras. On November 23, 2010, an Immigration Judge ordered his removal from the United States noting that the respondent did not file for any form of relief from removal. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent states in his Notice of Appeal that he is married to a United States citizen and is the father of citizen children. He requests an opportunity to remain in the United States. However, the respondent has not presented any evidence indicating that a visa petition has been filed on his behalf. We further are unable to identify any form of relief from removal that the respondent is eligible to seek. The respondent suggests on appeal that he is a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. He has not satisfied any of the procedural requirements for establish that claim. See Dakane v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005); Gbaya v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 342 F.3d 1219 (11th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hedwin Salmen-Navarro, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF THE DHS:
 
Timothy Maguire
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on August 3, 2010, when the Board denied the respondent’s third motion to reopen as untimely and number-barred and not excepted from the filing requirements imposed on motions to reopen removal proceedings. The Board rejected the respondent’s assertion that the time and numerical limits for filing his motion to reopen should be equitably tolled due to the alleged deficient performance of two non attorneys, both of whom allegedly advised and or represented the respondent after the completion of his proceedings before both the Immigration Judge and the Board. The Board concluded that the respondent did not substantially comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), did not demonstrate the required prejudice, and did not show due diligence. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra; Wang v. Bd. of Immigration Appeals, 508 F.3d 710 (2d Cir. 2007); Debeatham v. Holder, 602 F.3d, 481, 486 (2d Cir. 2010). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). On December 10, 2010, the respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, filed a fourth motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
To the extent the respondent seeks reconsideration, the motion is untimely. See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Moreover, to the extent the respondent’s motion rests on previously raised issues related to the alleged deficient performance of one or both of the non attorneys, the respondent has not identified any issue that was not considered in the Board’s previous decision, nor has he identified any error of fact or law in that decision that would alter the outcome. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). The respondent’s apparent request for reconsideration is therefore denied.
 
*2 Similarly, the respondent’s present motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred and has not been shown to qualify for any exception to the time and numerical limitations imposed on motions to reopen removal proceedings. As previously found, the respondent has not demonstrated the required prejudice stemming from his prior attorney’s alleged deficient performance. See Matter of Assaad, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra; Debeatham v. Holder, supra. See also Matter of Compean, supra. The respondent has not sufficiently described or submitted or pointed to any evidence supporting his claim that his two United States citizen step children, who were not included in the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal, would suffer the requisite level of hardship upon the respondent’s removal. Nor does the record support the respondent’s claim that he was at any stage in his proceedings before either the Immigration Judge, the Board, or the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, either unaware that he was granted the privilege of voluntary departure or not properly advised of his obligations in connection with such grant. Further, the respondent has not shown due diligence in making his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Wang v. Bd. of Immigration Appeals, supra.
 
Finally, the respondent has not demonstrated an “exceptional situation” that would warrant sua sponte reopening of these proceedings as a matter of discretion. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating “the power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999).
 
On this record, the respondent has not provided us with an adequate reason to overlook the fact that his motion is untimely and number-barred. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion and related request for a stay of removal are denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Daniel J. Redwood

APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 On January 20, 2011, the respondent submitted a “motion to reopen” the Board’s November 26, 2010, decision dismissing his appeal. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which is denied.
 
To the extent that the respondent avers the Board committed error in our decision, this aspect of his motion is one seeking reconsideration. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). It is untimely as it was filed more than 30 days after the Board’s final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The respondent also contends that former counsel provided him with ineffective assistance. However, the respondent did not file a complaint with the bar authorities in Louisiana. Rather, he sent a letter of complaint about Mr. Abrusley to the American Bar Association, which is a private association that does not have the authority to engage in any disciplinary action against Mr. Abrusley. Moreover the respondent has not demonstrated any prejudice as he has not shown either that he was not removable as charged, or that he was eligible for any relief from removal. As the respondent has not satisfied the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, reopening on this basis is not warranted. Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

File: AXXX XX5 251 - Seattle, WA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Eric M. Pedersen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s April 27, 2010, decision ordering him removed from the United States. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Canada, admitted that he was convicted of, among other offenses, theft in the 3rd degree under the Revised Code of Washington, for which he was sentenced to 365 days imprisonment (Tr. at 17; I.J. at 2). We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that this offense qualifies as an “aggravated felony” under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G), to wit: a theft offense for which the term of imprisonment was at least 1 year (I.J. at 2).
 
As an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, the respondent is ineligible for most forms of relief from removal, including asylum, cancellation of removal, voluntary departure, and waiver of inadmissibility. We find no indication that the respondent has expressed any fear of returning to Canada.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that his prior attorney did not inform him of certain filing dates and did not adequately communicate with him (Respondent’s Notice of Appeal; Respondent’s Brief). We construe these arguments as a claim of ineffective assistance by prior counsel. However, other than advancing an allegation of ineffective assistance, the respondent has not met any of the requirements necessary to establish a claim for ineffective assistance pursuant to our precedent cases governing ineffective assistance. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
We are mindful of the holding by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Castillo-Perez v. I.N.S., 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000), wherein the court held that the requirements for ineffective of assistance under Matter of Lozada, supra, are “not sacrosanct” and that “substantial compliance” may be sufficient to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. However, we find that ineffective assistance of counsel in the instant case has not been established. The respondent’s failure to meet any of the requirements under Matter of Lozada, supra, and the lack of explanation for the failure to do so, does not demonstrate “substantial compliance” as established in Castillo-Perez v. I.N.S., supra.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: DANIEL ESAU ORTEGA A.K.A. DANIEL ESAU ORTEGA MURILLO A.K.A. MURILLO ORTEGA
File: AXXX XX7 092 - Houston, TX
February 3, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Aron M. Mandl, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In a decision dated May 4, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). The respondent filed a timely appeal from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 723 (BIA 1999). The term “exceptional circumstances” is defined by the Act as “exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
Ineffective assistance of counsel can qualify as an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescinding an in absentia order where the alien failure to appear is due to his attorney’s errant instruction. Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Atty. Gen. 514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir. 2008); Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472, 473-74 (BIA 1996).
 
The respondent argues that his case should be reopened due to the ineffective assistance of a relative of a friend, named Marcos,¿FN1º a notario who held himself out as an attorney. We concur with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion was both untimely and he did not establish that his failure to appear was caused by “exceptional circumstances.”
 
The respondent argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling and cites to circuit court authority from circuits other than the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case lies. However, the Eleventh Circuit has found that the 180-day filing deadline is not subject to equitable tolling or other exceptions, even in the case of ineffective assistance of counsel or where the alien acts blamelessly. See Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1278-79 (11th Cir. 1999); see also Abdi v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir. 2005) (concluding that petitioner’s motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, filed after the 90-day deadline in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), could not be equitably tolled).
 
*2 Moreover, the Eleventh Circuit has held that the Board does not abuse its discretion by filtering ineffective-assistance claims through the Lozada requirements when considering a motion to reopen. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1223 (11th Cir. 2003) (per curiam). Although the Eleventh Circuit has not explicitly held that Lozada applies to claims of ineffective assistance rendered by non-attorneys, such a conclusion was implicit in its decision in Montano Cisneros, supra.
 
Here, although the respondent maintains that he is in the process of contacting the Texas Bar regarding his claim against the notario, the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Specifically, the respondent failed to file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of the notario’s responsibilities, and further has not explained why he has not done so.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. §1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: JUAN JOSE GARCIA-REGALADO
File: AXXX XX1 464 - Atlanta, GA
January 31, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carolina Colin-Antonini, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joy Lampley Fortson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the March 15, 2010, decision of the Immigration Judge denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings conducted in absentia on December 8, 2009. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings. The respondent acknowledges personal service of the Notice to Appear while in custody. The DHS released the respondent after requiring him to post bond, wear an ankle bracelet monitor, and report to a DHS officer monthly. The respondent acknowledges that notice of hearing was properly mailed to him at the last address he provided, but states that his wife received the mail and did not inform him of the notice of hearing, as she thought it applied to her pending removal proceedings. The respondent admits that he was reminded by a DHS officer of his December 8, 2009, hearing when he reported as required in November of 2009. However, the respondent forgot about his hearing date. The respondent claims that his attorney misfiled his case and failed to inform him of his hearing date, which amounts to ineffective assistance.
 
On appeal the respondent argues that the issue in this case is not whether he had notice of his hearing, as the respondent acknowledges proper delivery. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27, 32 (BIA 1995). Rather, the respondent’s argues that ineffective assistance of counsel justifies reopening on the basis of “exceptional circumstances.” We have recognized in the past that the deficient performance of counsel can constitute exceptional circumstances excusing a failure to appear at a scheduled hearing. Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997); see also Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we held that motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. See also Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004).
 
*2 We disagree with the respondent’s assertion in a footnote that he has complied with the Lozada requirements (Respondent’s Br. at 8). We note that the former counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned is the same attorney who filed the motion to reopen. Even if we consider the motion to reopen sufficient to satisfy the first two prongs of Lozada, the respondent has not satisfied the third. The respondent has not stated whether a complaint has been filed with his former counsel’s disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. Therefore, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings.
 
Even assuming arguendo that the respondent satisfied the Lozada requirements, we conclude that the circumstances in this case do not qualify as “exceptional circumstances” under section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. To qualify as such, the circumstances must be “beyond the control of the alien.” Id. The failure of the respondent to communicate with his wife concerning important documents being delivered to their household was within the control of the respondent. Moreover, the forgetfulness of the respondent and his failure to attend a hearing, even after being reminded by a DHS officer, were also within the control of the respondent. Therefore, the failure to appear at his removal proceedings is not excused, and we decline to set aside the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen his in absentia removal order. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Canada. On March 3, 2009, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s request for voluntary departure. On June 4, 2009, the respondent attempted to file a motion to reopen his proceedings based on his marriage to a United States citizen. The respondent did not attach the required filing fee (I.J. at 1). On June 11, 2009, the motion was filed with the proper fee (I.J. at 1). On June 17, 2009, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen as untimely (I.J. at 1). The respondent appeals this decision.
 
On July 2, 2009, citing the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), the respondent filed a motion to reconsider arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in the filing of his motion to reopen. On July 15, 2009, the Immigration Judge construed the motion to reconsider as a motion to reopen and denied it as numerically-barred. The respondent has not appealed that decision. Moreover, while the respondent’s appeal was pending, the I-130 filed by his United States citizen wife was approved. Therefore, the respondent filed a motion to reopen before this Board based on the approved I-130. See Attachment A to Motion to Reopen.
 
In light of the approval of the respondent’s visa petition, we will remand this case to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s application for adjustment of status. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and the entry of a new decision.

IN RE: DARRYL SAMBURY
File: AXXX XX6 391 - New York, NY

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bindhu Vijayan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Wendy Leifer
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on June 7, 2010, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance by his former counsel. On July 7, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must identify an error of fact or law in the Board’s prior decision. See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (finding that a motion to reconsider must allege a material factual or legal error or argue a change in law); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991) (noting that the very nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard). The respondent has not identified any error in the Board’s last decision.
 
The respondent first claims that the Board erred in finding that the respondent failed to substantially comply with the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). We observed that the motion to reopen did not reflect that the respondent’s former counsel had been informed of the allegations leveled against him and that the former counsel had been given an opportunity to respond. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639 (given the potential for abuse, the alien’s former counsel must be given an opportunity to present his version of events if he so chooses). The respondent now claims, for the first time, that he sent a carbon copy of the bar complaint to his former counsel. Also, for the first time, he has submitted a sheet of paper carrying the notation, “CC: Figeroux & Associates, Attorney at Law, 26 Court Street, Suite 701, Brooklyn, NY 11242.” This is new evidence that was not submitted with the motion to reopen.
 
Furthermore, as the DHS has observed in its opposition statement, the respondent’s current motion does not even address several significant points in the Board’s June 7, 2010, decision. We explained in that decision that although the respondent described his interactions with his former counsel while he was considering marriage to a United States citizen, he did not address what actions he took, or when he took them, to inform his former attorney that the marriage had actually taken place. The respondent never established that his former attorney was informed, within the 90-day motion to reopen period, that the marriage had taken place. Thus, the respondent did not establish that ineffective assistance was the reason his motion to reopen to seek adjustment of status was not timely filed.
 
*2 Also, the respondent did not demonstrate how any alleged ineffective assistance of counsel prejudiced him, given that the visa petition filed on his behalf by his wife was denied. Without an approved visa petition, the respondent is not able to adjust his status. Accordingly, the failure to file a timely motion to reopen for the purpose of seeking adjustment of status has not been shown to have resulted in prejudice.
 
The motion to reconsider does not identify an error in the Board’s last decision. The motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mahmoud Ramadan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The motion is denied. On November 8, 2010, the respondent, a native and citizen of Senegal, filed a motion to reopen and reconsider the Board’s decision dated September 30, 2010, dismissing the respondent’s appeal. However, the respondent’s request for reconsideration is untimely. See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Moreover, the respondent has not identified any issue that was not considered in the Board’s previous detailed decision, nor has he identified any error of fact or law in that decision that would alter the outcome. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider).
 
The Immigration Judge granted the respondent several prior continuances to pursue his October of 2006 appeal of the government’s decision denying his application for adjustment of status (Resp. Brief at Tabs C-D; Exh. 7). The respondent neither submitted nor described evidence demonstrating that the denial of the last request for another continuance was erroneous. Nor did he submit any other evidence demonstrating his eligibility for any other form of relief. Under the circumstances, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s request for another continuance. See also Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 788-94 (BIA 2009) (recognizing that the denial of a motion for a continuance is permissible where it is based on the number and length of prior continuances coupled with other relevant factors such as the lack of evidence indicating that the denial of the I-130 petition was erroneous, despite a pending appeal).
 
Further, inasmuch as the respondent has not submitted or pointed to any evidence demonstrating his eligibility for adjustment of status or any other form of relief, the respondent has not sufficiently demonstrated that he suffered any prejudice by the alleged action or inaction of his former counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
*2 On this record, the respondent has not sufficiently demonstrated that further hearings are warranted. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion and related request for a stay of removal are denied.

File: AXXX XX4 231 - Atlanta, GA
January 21, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrew P. Johnson, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On June 8, 2010, the Board denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, which was based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent asserted that his former counsel, George E. Lee, Esquire, failed to notify him about his immigration court hearing until the night before, when it was too late for the respondent to make the trip from New York to Atlanta. The former counsel sent another attorney to the immigration court and this attorney did not admit Attorney Lee’s error to the Immigration Judge. The respondent’s failure to attend his hearing led to his being ordered removed in absentia. Attorney Lee’s error was not acknowledged in either the motion to reopen or the subsequent appeal, both of which were filed by Lee’s law firm.
 
The respondent’s last motion claimed that a bar complaint had been filed against Attorney Lee, and that Attorney Lee had been sent a copy of the complaint. The motion further claimed that proof of the complaint and notice to counsel were included with the motion. However, no such evidence was included. The respondent’s motion was denied because it failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent has now filed the missing evidence with a statement that due to a clerical error it was not included with the last motion.
 
Considering the totality of circumstances presented in the respondent’s present motion, which has not been opposed by the Department of Homeland Security, the proceedings will be reopened on our own motion under the provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge to vacate the in absentia order of removal and provide the respondent with a new hearing.
 
ORDER: Proceedings are reopened under the provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings not inconsistent with this order.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 On December 1, 2010, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen the Board’s August 25, 2008, decision dismissing his appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision finding him ineligible for relief from removal. The motion is denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely as it was filed more than 2 years after the expiration of the deadline for such motions. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent contends, however, that former counsel provided him with ineffective assistance, so that reopening is nonetheless warranted. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-99 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent essentially avers that former counsel, Michael Jacob, erred by conceding removability as charged rather than arguing that the respondent’s conviction did not render him deportable as it was not for a crime of violence. He also asserts Mr. Jacob erred by not pursuing a petition for review before the circuit court. In his motion, the respondent also argues that his conviction was not for a crime of violence. This issue was previously discussed in our decision, and any motion to reconsider that decision is untimely.
 
The respondent has not satisfied the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, supra. While he has submitted evidence indicating that he has filed a grievance against Mr. Jacob, there is no evidence that he has informed Mr. Jacob of the allegations against him, and afforded him an opportunity to respond. Similarly, he has not supported his motion with an affidavit setting forth “in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken,” as well as any representations made by counsel to the alien, as required. Id. Further, the respondent has not shown that he exercised due diligence in the more than 2 years in between the issuance of the Board’s decision, and the filing of the instant motion. Iturribarria v. INS, supra at 897-99. He has not explained what actions, if any, he undertook with regard to his case during that period. Given these issues, we find that the respondent has not demonstrated that his motion should be exempt from the statutory time-bar on motions to reopen. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Diane Dodd
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Panama, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 12, 2010. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On January 22, 2008, the respondent was convicted of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of a cocaine mixture, in violation of federal law. A record of this conviction was entered into the record of proceedings. See Exh. 2. See also 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41(a). Cf. Fequiere v. Ashcroft, 279 F.3d 1325, 1327 (11th Cir. 2002). In addition, the respondent admitted the conviction, both personally and through counsel. See Tr. at 7, 10-11. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.41(d), 1240.10(c). Cf. Fequiere v. Ashcroft, supra, at 1327. Based on this evidence, the Immigration Judge found the conviction proved. See I.J. at 1-2.
 
The respondent was charged with being removable for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation and an aggravated felony relating to conspiracy and illicit trafficking in a controlled substance. See Exh. 1. The respondent conceded removability through counsel. See Tr. at 7. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged. See I.J. at 2.
 
The respondent personally expressed no fear of return to Panama. See Tr. at 11. The respondent requested no relief, either personally or through counsel, and the Immigration Judge concluded that he was ineligible for relief. See Tr. at 7, 11-12; I.J. at 2.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent argues that his counsel provided him ineffective representation. However, the respondent has failed to fulfil the prerequisites for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent did not attach to the appeal a sworn affidavit setting out the alleged facts necessary to show a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. This affidavit should have identified what his former counsel did or failed to do and identified how the former counsel’s action or inaction negatively affected the outcome of the respondent’s case. The affidavit should have also indicated that the respondent has notified the former counsel of the allegation of ineffective assistance, enabling the former counsel to respond to the allegation. In addition, the affidavit should have indicated that a complaint has been filed against the former counsel with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. See Matter of Grijalva, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
Moreover, we find no prejudice here. See Matter of Assaad, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra. We find that the respondent’s admissions and the conviction record in the record of proceedings prove he is removable as charged in the notice to appear by clear and convincing evidence. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(a); Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276, 286 (1966). Cf. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.15, 1240.10. We also find no error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent is ineligible for relief from removal.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Adriana Gomez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Andrew Brown
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on November 23, 2010, when the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings that were conducted in absentia on March 5, 2009. The Board determined, in part, that the respondent’s letter requesting a continuance of his hearing evidenced that the respondent received notice of his hearing. The Board also noted that although the respondent alleged that his former counsel was ineffective, he did not assert that his former counsel’s action or inaction resulted in the respondent missing his March 5, 2009, hearing. Rather, the respondent was only seeking to have his payments to his former counsel refunded. On December 6, 2010, the respondent, a native and citizen of Canada, filed a motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
To the extent the respondent seeks reconsideration based on previously raised issues, he has not identified any error of fact or law in the Board’s previous detailed decision that would alter the outcome. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). Although the respondent claims that he never sent a letter requesting a continuance of his scheduled hearing, the record contains such a request bearing the respondent’s signature (Exh. 3). Further, the record reveals that notice of the respondent’s March 5, 2009, hearing that was scheduled to begin at 8:30 a.m., was properly mailed to the Deland, Florida address contained on the Notice to Appear, which is the same address that is listed on the change of address form that was submitted after both the Notice to Appear and Notice of Hearing were issued (Exhs. 1, 3, 5; Form EOIR-33/IC). The Form-EOIR-33/IC indicates that the respondent’s address changed from the Deland, Florida address to an Ontario, Canada address, which is the same address that is listed on the respondent’s request for a continuance and is consistent with the respondent’s former counsel’s statement indicating that the respondent had returned to Canada in or around January of 2009 (Compare Form EOIR-33/IC, with Exh. 3, and, Resp. Brief at Tab 8). The respondent does not dispute that he provided the Deland, Florida address. Indeed, he admits that he owns the property at the Deland, Florida address. Nor does he contend that the Notices never arrived at the Deland, Florida address. Rather, the respondent asserts only that “to the address in Deland he often loses the mail.” (Resp. Brief at 2).
 
*2 On this record, we do not find that the respondent has sufficiently demonstrated that the alleged action or inaction of his former counsel reasonably affected the respondent’s receipt of either the Notice to Appear or the Notice of Hearing. The respondent therefore has not demonstrated the required prejudice stemming from his former counsel’s alleged behavior. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
Finally, the respondent has not demonstrated that this case involves an exceptional situation for sua sponte reopening under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Nor has the respondent submitted or pointed to evidence demonstrating that reopening for further hearings is warranted. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion and related request for a stay of removal are denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Stephen A. Johnston
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on January 12, 2006, when we denied the respondent’s untimely filed motion to reopen. On May 10, 2010, the respondent filed another motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
With certain exceptions, an alien is entitled to file only one motion to reopen and the motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order of deportation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The final administrative order in this matter was entered on May 23, 2003. The respondent’s motion is both time-barred and number-barred. There is an exception for motions to reopen that seek to apply for asylum or withholding based on changed country conditions. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(H) (providing that the time and numerical limitations for motions to reopen do not apply to motions to apply for asylum or withholding based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or to which deportation has been ordered, if the respondent presents evidence that is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing). Additionally, anyone who seeks to reopen immigration proceedings bears the heavy burden of showing that if proceedings were reopened, the new evidence offered would likely change the result in the case. See Shin v. Mukasey, 547 F.3d 1019 (9th Cir. 2008); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1992).
 
The respondent contends that her current motion falls within the changed country conditions exception to the time and number requirements for motions to reopen. The respondent also claims that she received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorney who filed her prior motion to reopen.
 
First, the respondent has not established that her motion falls within the changed country conditions exception. She contends that a coup in 2006 in Fiji constitutes a changed condition since her hearing, which was in 2001. She further contends that conditions are deteriorating for ethnic Indians in Fiji (Mot. at 6-7). The respondent additionally asserts that she suffered past persecution while living in Fiji and that this occurred after the 1987 coup in that country (Mot. at 3) She also states that after another coup, in 2000, many Indian Fijians lost their property and were assaulted by the native Fijians, and that the police and the army refused to assist the Indian Fijians (Mot. at 3). To support her claim, the respondent has submitted her own statement, statements from persons in Fiji, and background evidence about Fiji.
 
*2 The respondent’s evidence does not establish changed country conditions but a continuation of conditions. The affidavit of Sajla Nand, for example, states that the conditions for Indo-Fijians have been problematic since the coup of 1987 (Exh. B). The State Department report reflects that “¿tºension between ethnic Fijians and Indo-Fijians has been a long-standing problem.” See United States Dep’t of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, 2009 Human Rights Reports: Fiji, 14 (Mar. 11, 2010) (Exh. D). The report does not reflect that conditions for Indo- Fijians have materially changed since 2001. Nor does any of the other evidence reflect a material change in conditions. Because the respondent has not established changed conditions in Fiji that are material to her eligibility for asylum or withholding, she has not shown that her motion comes within the exception to the filing requirements.
 
The respondent also asserts that her former attorney, Tsz-Hai Huang, provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, she states that Attorney Huang, whom she retained in 2005, failed to file a Form I-130 based on the respondent’s 2003 marriage, and also failed to inform the respondent that she was eligible to self-petition as the widow of a United States citizen after her husband died in 2006 (Mot. at 7-8). Aliens raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a motion may have the time limits on motions equitably tolled. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). However, such tolling applies only when the alien was prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error, and only when the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. Id. Here, the respondent fails to explain in her current motion why she waited more than 4 years after the Board denied her first motion to reopen, on which her former attorney represented her, before filing the current motion. The respondent has not shown that equitable tolling applies.
 
In addition, the respondent has failed to comply with the requirements for ineffective assistance claims as set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640.
 
*3 As the DHS correctly contends, the respondent admits that she has not filed a complaint with the relevant state bar association (Mot. at 8), and there is no evidence that she has even informed Attorney Huang of her accusations. Accordingly, she has not substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, supra, and her motion is properly denied for that reason. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000) (motions to reopen alleging ineffective assistance can be in denied where Lozada requirements are not substantially met, as such requirements are reasonable in ordinary circumstances); see also Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 825 (9th Cir. 2003) (observing the importance of the disciplinary reporting requirement of Lozada). Furthermore, the respondent’s accusations against Attorney Huang are conclusory, and the respondent has not provided sufficient evidence to show she was, in fact, eligible for additional relief. Thus, she has not shown prejudice. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004) (substantial prejudice must be shown, meaning that the alleged ineffectiveness affected the outcome of the proceedings).
 
In summary, the respondent has not established that her motion falls within any exception to the filing requirements for motions to reopen. She has also not established that the time period for filing her motion should be equitably tolled. The respondent has not substantially complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, with respect to her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and she has not established prejudice based on her former attorney’s representation. Accordingly, the respondent has not established that reopening is warranted in this matter.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: JORGE CHRISTOPHER GONZALEZ A.K.A. JORGE GONZALEZ
File: AXXX XX1 284 - New York, NY
December 28, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alfonso Ramos, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On November 18, 2010, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen the Board’s August 18, 2010, decision dismissing his appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision finding him ineligible for relief from removal. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion will be denied.
 
In his motion the respondent alleges that his former attorney, Wayne Zhu, provided him with ineffective assistance as Mr. Zhu did not submit an application for withholding of removal before the Immigration Judge. He further states that he is seeking a pardon for the conviction forming the basis for the charges of removability (Exh. 1).
 
While the respondent has demonstrated that he submitted a complaint with the bar authorities against Mr. Zhu, he has not otherwise complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 126-27 (2d Cir. 2000). For example, there is no evidence that he notified Mr. Zhu of the allegations against him, nor has he provided an affidavit setting forth “in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken,” as well as any representations made by counsel.
 
In addition, the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance, i.e., that had the application been filed, the result would have been different. Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006); Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108, 111 (2d Cir. 1993). The asylum application submitted with the motion is incomplete. It fails to identify any reason why the respondent is seeking such relief, and provides no narrative explanations of what harm he allegedly fears, at whose hands, and on what basis.¿FN1º Given this record, reopening is not warranted, and his motion is not exempt from the time-bar on motions to reopen.
 
We recognize that the respondent appears to be pursuing a Governor’s pardon of the criminal conviction at issue. However, the fact that the respondent may be pursuing post-conviction relief in the form of a pardon does not affect the finality of his conviction for immigration purposes. Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996); Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992). He has presented no evidence showing that the pardon has been granted, or that he has any likelihood of success in this regard. Therefore, reopening in this regard is not appropriate. Further, we do not find that the filing of the respondent’s pardon request constitutes exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of our discretionary authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied as untimely.

While we recognize that respondent’s counsel has made allegations in this regard in the motion to reopen, we note that statements of counsel contained in a motion are not competent evidence of the facts alleged, and thus are not entitled to any evidentiary weight. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980); see also INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
J. Mark Kang
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGES:

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Hungary, adjusted her status to lawful permanent resident on April 29, 1991, retroactive to April 11, 1989, the date on which she was granted conditional status. On June 28, 1996, the respondent was convicted of commercial burglary and grand theft in violation of sections 459, 460(b), and 487(a) of the California Penal Code (Exh. 1, 1A). A Notice to Appear was issued on December 11, 1997, but was not filed until April 1, 2003. On June 10, 2004, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged, and ordered her removed to Hungary. The respondent appealed the removal order but then withdrew her appeal (BIA, dated September 28, 2004, at 1).
 
On August 5, 2010, the respondent filed a motion styled “Respondent Request to Review Her Removal Proceedings and Her Appeal.” The respondent argued that the removal order was incorrect because at the time she was convicted, the offenses of burglary and grand theft were not aggravated felonies. The Immigration Judge construed the motion as a motion to reopen, and on September 3, 2010, denied the motion as untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (2010). The respondent now appeals. The respondent’s request for a waiver of the appellate filing fee is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that her counsel during the removal proceedings was ineffective (DHS Br. filed September 2, 2010, at 2; Form EOIR-26, attached statement at 1). As the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) points out the respondent did not raise this argument in her motion before the Immigration Judge (DHS Br. at 2). She cannot argue for the first time on appeal that her counsel during the 2004 removal proceedings was ineffective (DHS Br. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(b) (providing that the statement of the basis of appeal must “specifically identify the findings of fact, the conclusions of law, or both, that are being challenged”).
 
*2 Additionally, the respondent has not presented evidence of her compliance with any of the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998) (DHS Br. at 2-3, 4). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). In Matter of Lozada, supra, we stated that a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel requires that (1) the motion be supported by an affidavit of the applicant setting forth in detail the agreement between the applicant and her legal representative and what actions were to be taken on her behalf; (2) the counsel whose reputation is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) the motion reflect whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. The record does not contain any of the required documentation.
 
Furthermore, the allegations made regarding ineffective assistance of counsel appear disingenuous. For example, the respondent alleges that her prior counsel did not inform her of, or bring her to, her final removal hearing (Form EOIR-26, attached statement at 1). The record indicates that the respondent was present on June 10, 2004, when the Immigration Judge ordered her removed to Hungary (Form EOIR-26, attached statement at 1; Tr. at 7-22).¿FN1º
 
The respondent also suggests that prior counsel did not inform her that she was eligible for relief from removal under INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001) (Form EOIR-26, attached statement at 1). The argument is not persuasive. The transcript reveals that at the June 10, 2004, hearing, prior counsel raised the issue of whether the respondent was eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) pursuant to INS v. St. Cyr, supra (Tr. at 18).
 
More importantly, INS v. St. Cyr, supra, does not help the respondent (DHS Br. filed November 5, 2010, at 4-6; DHS Br. filed September 2, 2010, at 2-3). In INS v. St. Cyr, supra, the Supreme Court held that the restrictions on section 212(c) relief do not apply retroactively to an alien who pled guilty before April 24, 1996, the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”). The respondent was convicted after a bench trial,¿FN2º and the convictions were sustained on June 28, 1996, 2 months after the AEDPA’s effective date (DHS Br. filed November 5, 2010, at 4-6; Respondent’s Br. filed September 20, 2010, at 4;Tr. at 12, 17; Exh. 1, 1A). See INS v. Velasco-Medina, 305 F.3d 839, 849-850 (9th Cir. 2002) (explaining that relief under former section 212(c) was unavailable for an alien who was convicted after the AEDPA’s date of enactment); Kelava v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 1120, 1124-25 (9th Cir. 2006); Armendariz-Montoya v. Sonchik, 291 F.3d 1116, 1121 (9th Cir. 2002). Therefore, because the respondent cannot rely on INS v. St Cyr for relief, she cannot persuasively claim ineffective assistance of counsel based on misapplication of the law (DHS Br. filed November 5, 2010, at 4-6; DHS Br. filed September 2, 2010, at 2-3).
 
*3 The respondent argued in her motion, and again on appeal, that she is eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), because her 1996 burglary and grand theft convictions predated the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”), and were not considered aggravated felonies at the time the convictions were entered (Respondent’s Br. filed September 20, 2010, at 2). She states that the offenses were not aggravated felonies because the term of imprisonment imposed was 4 years, and at the time, the definition of aggravated felony required the imposed term of imprisonment to be at least 5 years (Respondent’s Br. filed September 20, 2010, at 2; Respondent Request to Review Her Removal Proceedings and Her Appeal at 4).¿FN3º Congress, however, expressly stated that IIRIRA’s amendments to the definition of “aggravated felony” apply retroactively. See Pub. L. 104-208, § 321 (c), 110 Stat. 3009 (“The amendments made by this section shall apply to actions taken on or after the day of the enactment of this Act ¿September 30, 1996º, regardless of when the conviction occurred ….”). See also Alvarez-Barajas v. Gonzales, 418 F.3d 1050, 1054-55 (9th Cir. 2005); Matter of Yeung, 21 I&N Dec. 610, 614 (1997) (stating “¿aºny presumption against retroactivity cannot apply where Congress has clearly stated that a statute is to be applied retroactively.”). Having been convicted of an aggravated felony, the respondent is not eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). For this reason, she cannot claim that her prior counsel was ineffective in not pursuing relief under section 212(h).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent concedes that under Ninth Circuit precedent she is not eligible for relief under former section 212(c) because her 1996 convictions resulted from a trial (Respondent’s Br. filed September 20, 2010, at 4).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Meri S. Ponist, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lincoln Jalelian
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board issued an administratively final removal order in this case on June 15, 2006. The respondent’s three prior motions have been denied. On August 2, 2010, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen. The respondent reasserts his prior ineffective assistance claim against the counsel who represented him on appeal and against the counsel who represented him before the Immigration Judge.
 
We will not address the respondent’s claim that he received ineffective assistance from counsel Anthony D. Collins at his hearings before the Immigration Judge beyond commenting that there is no evidence in the record that Mr. Collins represented the respondent in these proceedings. In fact, contrary to the respondent’s declaration, the counsel who appeared on his behalf at his last immigration hearing was Alec J. Niziolek, Esquire, who is not mentioned at all in the motion (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 1, 5).¿FN1º The fact that Mr. Niziolek was affiliated with Mr. Collins’ law firm does not create an ineffective assistance claim against Mr. Collins absent specific evidence that Collins performed a direct role in the case that unfairly prejudiced its outcome. Individual attorneys, not law firms or other associations, must enter their appearances in cases before the Executive Office for Immigration Review and are individually accountable for their actions. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.17, 1003.101 et seq.
 
With respect to the respondent’s argument that he received ineffective assistance from his appellate counsel, M. Najmul Alam, warranting reopening of his proceedings or, alternatively, reissuance of the June 15, 2006, decision dismissing his appeal, we note that our last two decisions rejected his ineffective assistance claim against Mr. Alam for failure to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent has belatedly complied with the procedural steps, including the requirement that he notify the accused counsel and provide him an opportunity to respond. However, Mr. Alam’s response forcefully denies the respondent’s claims and states that he zealously represented the respondent on his appeal, timely notified the respondent of the Board’s decision and his options to seek further administrative or judicial review. According to Mr. Alam, the respondent then informed him that he did not wish him to perform any further services in his immigration case (MTR, Tab F). We find Mr. Alam’s response more persuasive than the respondent’s declaration, particularly in light of the material inaccuracies in the same declaration regarding Mr. Collins’ role in his case.¿FN2º
 
*2 Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the respondent has demonstrated a basis to equitably toll the general restrictions on motions and deny the motion as time and number-barred. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). See Iavorski v. United States INS, 232 F.3d 124, 129-135 (2d Cir. 2000)(aliens relying on equitable tolling must establish that their constitutional right to due process was violated by counsel’s conduct and that they exercised due diligence during the period sought to be tolled). See also Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 130-32 (2d Cir. 2008) (an alien is required to exercise due diligence both before and after he has or should have discovered ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

The record further reflects that an accredited representative, Olga Rog, represented the respondent before the immigration court on September 23, 2004, and that she withdrew from the case prior to the January 6, 2005, hearing where Mr. Niziolek appeared (Tr. at 5; Exh. 3).

2

The respondent’s arguments that his friend, Rashid, ineffectively assisted him are too vague to constitute a colorable claim, particularly since it does not appear that he attempted to assist the respondent until more than a year after his appeal was dismissed and that his assistance was principally related to the visa petition proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kenneth Panzer, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent’s motion is untimely filed and number-barred and has not been shown to qualify for any exception to the filing requirements imposed on motions to reopen removal proceedings. See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i), of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).¿FN1º Similarly, the respondent’s request for reopening to pursue her application for adjustment of status based on a pending Form I-360 petition as an abused spouse of a United States citizen, is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv) of the Act. That section contains a special rule for battered spouses which provides an exception to the motions’ deadlines. The applicable deadline can be waived where someone wishes to self-petition for adjustment of status as an abused spouse of a United States citizen, has provided a copy of the petition, and files the motion within one year of the entry of the final order of removal. This time limitation can be waived in the exercise of discretion if an alien can demonstrate extraordinary circumstances or extreme hardship to a child. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv) of the Act.
 
The record reflects the Board entered a final order of removal on April 6, 2004. However, the instant motion was not filed until June 1, 2010. In this instance, in order to apply the statutory exception found in section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv) of the Act to the filing deadline, the motion had to have been submitted within one year of the entry of the final order of removal. As noted above, the record reflects that more than 6 years have passed since the Board entered its final order of removal and the respondent filed the instant motion. Furthermore, in order to waive this time limitation, the respondent must demonstrate extraordinary circumstances or extreme hardship to her child. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv)(III) of the Act. Despite her pending petition, the respondent has presented no evidence as to any extraordinary circumstances or extreme hardship to a child, to cause us to exercise favorable discretion in this instance.
 
Finally, the respondent has not demonstrated that this case involves an exceptional situation for sua sponte reopening under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). On this record, the respondent has provided us with no reason to overlook the fact that her motion is untimely and number-barred. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion and related request for a stay of removal are denied.

By motion filed on November 18, 2010, the respondent withdrew her asserted ineffective assistance of counsel claim. However, to the extent the respondent continues to claim ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has not sufficiently shown patent error or prejudice.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Shannon Shepherd, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Amy E. Greene
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondents, a married couple who are natives and citizens of the Philippines, move this Board to reconsider our June 29, 2010, final decision.¿FN1º 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). In that decision, we dismissed the appeal of the Immigration Judge’s January 30, 2009, decision denying adjustment of status. Section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent entered the United States as a non-immigrant visitor on July 3, 2003, with authority to remain until July 1, 2004. She filed a valid Form I-140 and an Application for Adjustment of Status (Form I-485) with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) on May 28, 2004. Ultimately, the application for adjustment was denied on October 20, 2005, because the respondent failed to provide the required certificate pursuant to section 212 (a)(5(C) of the Act (an alien seeking entry to perform labor as a health-care worker other than a physician must present a certificate from the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools or equivalent in order to be admissible). See also section 245(a) of the Act. The respondent filed a second Form I-485 with the USCIS on December 5, 2005. On October 17, 2007, this application was denied because the respondent had not maintained valid non-immigrant status since her last entry as required by section 245(c) of the Act, and she did not qualify for an exception because she had been out of status since July 1, 2004, well beyond the 180 day excepted period under section 245(k) of the Act. See also Matter of L-K-, 23 I&N Dec. 677 (BIA 2004).
 
A motion to reconsider a decision of the Board must include, in relevant part, the following: (1) an allegation of material factual or legal errors in the prior decision that is supported by pertinent authority; and (2) if there has been a change in law, a reference to the relevant statute, regulation, or precedent and an explanation of how the outcome of the Board’s decision is materially affected by the change. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). This motion argues essentially that the respondents were in the United States within a period of authorized stay while the applications for adjustment of status were pending, and therefore the respondents had not been out of status for over 180 days when they filed their second application for adjustment of status.
 
*2 However, where a first application is denied and a second adjustment application is filed, the period after which the nonimmigrant status expired and during which the first adjustment of status application was pending counts against the 180-day period. See USCIS HQDOMO 70/23.1-P AD06-07 memorandum on Applicability of Section 245(k) to certain Employment-Based Adjustment of Status Application under section 245(a) of the Act. The period that the respondent was out of status began on July 1, 2004, and continued until she filed the second Form I-485 on October 17, 2007, over three years. Therefore, the period the respondent was out of status far exceeded the allowable 180 days. The motion essentially disagrees with our conclusion, but does not demonstrate any errors of law or fact in our prior decision that would warrant reconsideration.¿FN2º Accordingly, the following order will be entered.¿FN3º
 
ORDER: The motion for reconsideration is denied.

Insofar as the respondents argue that the unlawful presence accrued because of the mishandling of their case by their prior lawyer, this would be a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel and should be supported by evidence. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). No evidence has been proffered in support of this argument.

The respondents filed this motion within the 60 day voluntary departure period granted by the Board. Consequently, the grant of voluntary departure was automatically terminated, and the penalties for failure to depart voluntarily do not apply. See section 240B(d) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(3)(iii); see also generally Dada v. Mukasey, 128 S.Ct. 2307, 2309 (2008).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se¿FN1º
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The final administrative order was entered by this Board on December 28, 2009. Thereafter, in a decision dated August 19, 2010, the Board denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider. On October 15, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. With certain exceptions not pertinent here, the respondent is limited to one motion to reopen and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent’s motion to reopen is therefore barred by the time limitations applicable to motions. Furthermore, to the extent the respondent seeks reconsideration of the Board’s August 19, 2010, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider, the respondent’s motion is barred by regulation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). Nonetheless, to the extent the respondent’s motion rests on previously raised issues related to the alleged ineffective assistance of his first counsel, Irene M. Recio, the respondent has not identified any error of fact or law in the Board’s previous detailed decision that would alter the outcome. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider).
 
Moreover, notwithstanding the respondent’s alleged “confusion” over the date of his scheduled hearing, the respondent does not dispute that the Immigration Judge personally advised the respondent that he was required to appear on September 3, 2008, for his next scheduled hearing. Nor does the respondent specifically aver either that he was unable to understand the Immigration Judge’s direction or that his first counsel, Irene M. Recio, failed to advise the respondent that he must appear as directed. That the respondent apparently believed that he also had a hearing scheduled in April of 2008, does not alone support the respondent’s assertion that his first counsel never properly advised him that he was required to appear for his September 3, 2008, scheduled hearing, particularly in light of the respondent’s first counsel’s assertion that she did, in fact, advise the respondent that he was required to appear as scheduled. Under the circumstances, we do not find that the respondent has sufficiently demonstrated the required prejudice stemming from his second counsel’s, John D. Lee, alleged action or inaction on the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim against the respondent’s first counsel, Irene M. Recio. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
*2 On this record, the respondent has provided us with no adequate reason to overlook the untimeliness of his motion. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.

File: AXXX XX0 402 - Los Angeles, CA
December 14, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Luisito L. Lopez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines, appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 23, 2009, decision denying her motion to reopen her deportation proceedings following the Immigration Judge’s November 20, 2009, order granting the respondent voluntary departure.¿FN1º See section 240B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility determinations, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not satisfy the threshold requirements to establish ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (I.J. at 2-3). Although the respondent submitted a detailed letter of complaint addressed to her former counsel and a complaint form submitted to the disciplinary board of the State Bar of California, she did not submit an affidavit (I.J. at 2). Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. The Lozada requirements are not “rigidly” enforced by the United States Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit, but the Court has “never excused a petitioner’s failure to provide an affidavit where, as here, the facts underlying the petitioner’s claim were not ‘plain on the face of the administrative record.”’ Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 597 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal citation omitted). Because the record does not show “a clear and obvious case” of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent was not excused from meeting the formal requirements of Lozada. Castillo- Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (excusing compliance with Lozada where prior counsel did not timely file applications for relief but told the alien that the applications had been filed and the alien would have been prima facie eligible for relief).
 
Even if the respondent had substantially complied with the Lozada procedural factors, she did not establish that she suffered prejudice as a result of her former counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640; see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). First, the respondent claims that her former counsel improperly advised her to file a Form I-485 (Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status) and that the denial of the Form I-485 led to her placement in removal proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 7-8, 10). The respondent has not established, however, that these actions of her former counsel made the removal proceedings themselves unfair. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 974 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting that “¿rºemoval proceedings do not become constitutionally unfair simply because they are precipitated in part by an attorney’s advice instead of general INS delay, or because the illegal alien might believe that he could avoid detection until eligible for another form of relief”), amended on other grounds by 404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir. 2005).
 
*2 Second, the respondent claims to have suffered prejudice because her former counsel did not inform the Immigration Judge of the respondent’s efforts to dissolve her current marriage and marry her United States citizen boyfriend. The Immigration Judge, however, indicated that he would not have granted a continuance on that basis (I.J. at 3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356 (BIA 1983). Moreover, as the Immigration Judge found and the respondent admits on appeal, voluntary departure was the only relief available to the respondent at the time of the hearing (I.J. at 3; Respondent’s Br. at 8). The respondent has not demonstrated that her former counsel’s failure to inform the Immigration Judge of the respondent’s marital plans may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785 (9th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thomas J. Tarigo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 6, 2009. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings. On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel at his prior hearing. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462,464-65 (BIA2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&NDec. 493 (BIA2008).
 
Initially, we note that the respondent’s September 17, 2009, motion to reopen is untimely, inasmuch as the respondent failed to file his motion to reopen within 90 days of the Immigration Judge’s October 12, 2004, decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). Furthermore, while we recognize that the respondent has complied with the requirements outlined by the Board in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we find that the respondent has failed to establish that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance. An attorney’s tactical decisions in the preparation and presentation of an alien’s case do not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel See Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 934 (9th Cir. 1986). Respondent’s counsel advised the respondent to accept pre-conclusion voluntary departure, given the unlikelihood that the respondent would be granted cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act with his extensive criminal history, including convictions for petty theft, possession of a controlled substance, grand theft, spousal battery, vandalism, and inflicting corporal injury on a spouse. Under these circumstances, we find that the respondent has not demonstrated that reopening is warranted in this matter. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, who remained in the United States without authorization, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 15, 2010.¿FN1º The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’ findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.l(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent has been in removal proceedings since April 2009. He married a United States citizen on August 27, 2009, and they have a child in common. Because of her citizenship, the respondent’s wife could have, at any time since they married, file a visa petition (Form I-130) on his behalf. At the hearing below, the respondent was represented by Accredited Representative Reverend Robert Vitaglione. The Accredited Representative requested, and was granted, continuances to enable the respondent’s wife to file the visa petition on the respondent’s behalf. At the final hearing, on July 15, 2010, the Accredited Representative advised the Immigration Judge that the respondent had told him that the respondent’s wife had failed to file a visa petition on his behalf because she lacked the funds. See Tr. at 45-46. Based on that, the Immigration Judge found the relief abandoned, found the respondent removable, and ordered the respondent removed. See Tr. at 47-48.
 
On appeal, the respondent claims that it is the Accredited Representative’s fault that the visa petition was never filed. First, we note that the respondent was present when the Accredited Representative told the Immigration Judge that the respondent had told him that the visa petition had not been filed because the respondent’s wife lacked the funds. And the respondent did not object at the time and tell the Immigration Judge that the Accredited representative’s statement was not true. See Tr. at 46.
 
Moreover, the respondent has not fulfilled the prerequisites for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent has not shown evidence that he has notified the former Accredited Representative of the allegation of ineffective assistance, enabling the former Accredited Representative to respond to the allegations. See Matter of Grijalva, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 We also note that the respondent does not indicate on appeal that his United States citizen wife has, since the hearing, filed a visa petition on his behalf.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note that the Immigration Judge’s Order indicates that the respondent waived appeal. However, the hearing transcript reflects that the respondent indicated a desire to appeal the decision. See Tr. at 49. We also note that the respondent’s appeal was untimely. It was due on August 16, 2010, but was not received at this Board until August 20, 2010. Because the respondent is pro se, and because of the confusion wrought by the Immigration Judge’s order, we will take this appeal on certification. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maria Baldini-Potermin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mirta J. Woodall
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen the Board’s June 9, 2010, decision summarily dismissing his appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his application for cancellation of removal. He also seeks a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion and stay request are granted, and the record remanded.
 
The respondent claims in his motion that his former representative, Mr. McGonnagle, provided him with ineffective assistance by failing to submit relevant evidence relating to his positive equities and the associated decision whether a discretionary grant relief was warranted. He further alleges error in that former counsel’s failure to provide any reasons or bases for the appeal in either the Notice of Appeal or an appeal brief resulted in a summary dismissal. Mr. McGonnagle also reportedly erred by advising the respondent to plead guilty regarding a controlled substance charge despite his claim that he did not commit the offense. He contends these errors prejudiced him by preventing his claim from being fully presented, causing him to accept a criminal plea that adversely affected his immigration case, and resulting in the denial of his application for cancellation.
 
The record reflects that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and has shown that Mr. McGonnagle’s actions caused him prejudice. Surganova v. Holder, 612 F.3d 901, 907 (7th Cir. 2010); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Not only has the respondent shown that a bar complaint has been filed against former counsel with appropriate notice given, but he has also filed a receipt of the same from the bar authority (Tabs A, B; Suppl. Tab B). No response has been received from Mr. McGonnagle. The respondent has also shown that a post-conviction petition regarding the controlled substance offense has been filed. Given this record, we find it appropriate to grant the respondent’s motion and request for a stay of removal. The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further consideration.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

Ted Y. Yamada
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
REISSUED DECISION
 
*1 On May 20, 2010, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision finding him to be an arriving alien who was inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii), for making a false claim of United States citizenship. On August 18, 2010, the respondent filed a “Motion to Reopen Proceedings for Entry of New, Duplicate Decision Due to Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.” The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be granted.
 
We have considered the arguments presented by the parties in light of Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (finding that the Board has discretion to consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel based on the conduct of counsel that occurred after a final order of removal has been entered). We have also considered this matter in light of Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (concluding that strict compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), is not required when ineffectiveness is obvious), and Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934 (9th Cir. 2003) (waiving strict Lozada compliance when the attorney promptly acknowledged the error and there was no suggestion of collusion). We will exercise our discretion and will grant the respondent’s motion. Our decision of May 20, 2010, will be vacated and a final order in this matter will be issued as of this date, incorporating by reference the text of the attached vacated order.
 
ORDER: A final order in this matter is hereby issued as of this date, incorporating by reference the text of the attached vacated order.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Chunyu Jean Wang, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
 
Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)º - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s August 26, 2010, decision to deny his untimely motion to reopen. On October 17, 2003, the final administrative order in the respondent’s removal proceeding was entered by the Immigration Judge. On August 3, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reopen claiming ineffective assistance of counsel and new relief. On August 26, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied his motion finding the respondent failed to timely file, did not comply with proper ineffective assistance of counsel requirements, did not show due diligence.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that the prior Immigration Judge was biased and hostile towards his case. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
“¿Aº party may file only one motion to reopen deportation or exclusion proceedings (whether before the Board of the Immigration Judge) and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent did not file his motion to reopen within 90 days of the final administrative decision, nor did he file it on or before September 30, 1996. As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent filed his motion approximately 6-years late (I.J. at 2). As such, we agree with the Immigration Judge that his motion to reopen the final administrative order is time-barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The 90-day filing deadline may be equitably tolled when the motion to reopen is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154 (2d Cir. 2006). The respondent has argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and has complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In order to prevail on such a motion the movant must show that he exercised “due diligence in pursuing the case during the period ¿heº seeks to toll.” Ali v. Gonzales, 448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir. 2006); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000). A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must also meet the procedural requirements set out in Matter of Lozada, supra. Finally, the movant must establish that she suffered prejudice because of her attorney’s actions or failure to act. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638.
 
*2 No matter how ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006). The filing deadline for motions to reopen will be equitably tolled until the ineffective assistance is or should have been discovered by a reasonable person in the situation. See Cekic v. INS, supra. The party seeking such tolling bears the burden of proving that he was, in fact, diligent. See id.
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not adequately comply with the Matter of Lozada, supra, requirements as there was no proof a complaint was filed with the disciplinary committee or his prior counsel (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent was present at the merits hearing, aware and cognizant of the adverse determination rendered against him in 2003, and acknowledged that he wanted to appeal the decision at that time (I.J. at 2-3). Although he allegedly lost contact with his attorney, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent failed to present sufficient evidence that he attempted to write or contact his attorney or the Board of Immigration Appeals to inquire about the status of his case (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge held that even assuming arguendo there was ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent did not demonstrate due diligence by waiting 6-years to file his motion. See Cekic v. INS, supra. As the respondent filed the current motion to reopen approximately 6-years late, the respondent has not shown the requisite due diligence. Therefore, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the time bar for filing a motion to reopen may not be equitably tolled in his case (I.J. at 2). See Cekic v. INS, supra; see also Iavorski v. INS, supra.
 
Finally, the respondent argues that the prior Immigration Judge was biased and had a predisposition towards a disfavorable ruling in his case (Respondent’s Br. at 4-5). Although the Immigration Judge was dissatisfied with the respondent’s non-responsive and evasive answers, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the prior Immigration Judge’s behavior or statements on this record do not support a finding that he was biased or had pre-judged the case. Moreover, we note that the respondent’s disagreement with the ultimate outcome of the Immigration Judge’s decision is insufficient to demonstrate that the outcome was the result of bias or pre-judgement rather than his view of the facts and evidence presented. Consequently, we find that the respondent was not deprived of a full and fair hearing and received his due process. In sum, the respondent has failed to raise any argument on appeal warranting disturbing the Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: FRIDAY EMIKO OYIBO ITIE
File: AXXX XX4 634 - Dallas, TX
November 16, 2010
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vincent P. Martin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on July 30, 2010, when the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his deportation proceedings that were conducted in absentia on May 9, 1994. Specifically, noting that the record contains several notices of hearing that were mailed by certified mail to the last address provided by the respondent, the Board concluded that the respondent has not overcome the presumption of effective delivery by substantial and probative evidence of improper delivery. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27, 37 (BIA 1995). On September 1, 2010, the respondent filed a request for reconsideration. The motion will be denied.
 
By notice dated August 27, 2010, the respondent was notified that his motion to reconsider was being rejected because it did not contain the required fee or Fee Waiver Request form (Form EOIR-26A), and the motion was not accompanied by a completed Notice of Entry of Appearance (Form-EOIR-27). The respondent did not resubmit his motion until September 1, 2010. Therefore, the respondent’s motion to reconsider is untimely.¿FN1º
 
Nevertheless, to the extent the respondent’s motion rests on previously raised issues, the respondent has not identified any issue that was not considered in the Board’s previous detailed decision, nor has he identified any error of fact or law in that decision that would alter the outcome. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). Notably, although the respondent’s notices of hearing were ultimately returned as unclaimed, they were properly sent by certified mail to the last known address provided by the respondent (Notice of Hearing dated March 21, 1994, and corresponding envelope and certified mail receipt; Notice of Hearing dated April 11, 1994, and corresponding envelope and certified mail receipt). Further, the record contains no evidence indicating that the respondent ever notified the Immigration Court of any change in his address since service of the Order to Show Cause in 1994, which the respondent does not deny receiving. See Matter of Grijalva, supra. Under the circumstances, we do not find the respondent’s assertion that he did not reside at the address to which his notices of hearings were sent alone sufficient to demonstrate that the notices of hearings were sent to the wrong address. See, e.g., Joshi v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 732, 735 (7th Cir. 2004) (stating that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving, denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence”). Nor do we find the respondent’s mere disagreement with or disapproval of the outcome of the Board’s previous detailed decision sufficient to demonstrate either that the Board improperly evaluated or disregarded the facts and evidence presented or committed legal error. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

To the extent the respondent claims ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has not sufficiently shown patent error or prejudice. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Nor has he complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Amy N. Gell, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The Board issued a decision in this case on June 2, 2010, dismissing the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying a motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent was previously ordered removed in absentia on July 2, 2007. The respondent has filed a timely motion for reconsideration of our June 2, 2010, decision and another motion to reopen proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration, be supported by pertinent case precedent and be predicated on a legal or factual defect in the decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). A motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied. A motion to reconsider is not a mechanism by which a party may file a new brief before the Board raising additional legal arguments that are unrelated to those issues raised before the Immigration Judge and on appeal. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra. Notwithstanding the respondent’s disagreement with our decision and our evaluation of the evidence, we find no legal or factual defect in our June 2010 decision, based on the record then before us. Consequently, reconsideration is not warranted.
 
The motion to reopen is predicated upon a claim against the respondent’s former attorney. However, the respondent has not shown substantial compliance with the threshold requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). While the respondent in his affidavit states generally that the Lozada requirements have been met, he has not submitted a copy of the letter to his former attorney or a bar complaint. It is especially important to provide proof of compliance with the Lozada requirements where, as in this case, a respondent’s most recent affidavit contradicts information provided in an prior affidavit and he now claims that he was unaware of the contents of the prior affidavit prepared by his former attorney. Therefore, reopening is not warranted.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reconsider our prior decision and the motion to reopen proceedings will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion for reconsideration of the June 2, 2010, decision and the motion to reopen proceedings are denied.

James Hallagan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kelley N. Sydnor
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent is a citizen of Thailand. She appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 24, 2010. Therein, an Immigration Judge found her removable from the United States pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). The Immigration Judge further denied the respondent’s application for voluntary departure in the exercise of discretion. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent argues on appeal that she was denied due process in these proceedings. The respondent acknowledges that her former counsel conceded that she was removable from the United States pursuant to the aforementioned charge through written pleadings. She contends that her former counsel should not have conceded and the Immigration Judge should not have found her removable pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. The respondent concedes that she entered and was admitted into the United States using a false name.¿FN1º
 
A formal concession of removability made by the respondent’s attorney acting in his professional capacity during the respondent’s removal hearing and in the respondent’s presence is binding on the respondent as a judicial admission. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377,382 (BIA 1986); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c). There is no basis for the respondent to now challenge the factual findings or legal conclusions of the Immigration Judge that arose from that concession.
 
The respondent further argues on appeal that her former counsel provided her ineffective assistance of counsel. The procedural requirements for proving ineffective assistance of counsel were not satisfied. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).¿FN2º We further do not find that the respondent’s former counsel’s concession to the charge of removability constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. It appears that former counsel made the tactical decision to admit to a violation of section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act rather than requesting a finding of removability pursuant to the more serious charge for violating section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act. We do not find that counsel’s actions constituted a dereliction of duty. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998). We therefore do not see a reason to invalidate these proceedings or remand the record for the Immigration Judge to make an additional finding of removability pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
*2 The respondent further indicates on appeal that she desires a remand to file an application before the Immigration Judge for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The respondent abandoned her opportunity to file those applications because she did not do so at her hearing. She further indicates that she intends to file an application for a visa with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. However, she has not established her prima facie eligibility for a grant of adjustment of status before the Immigration Judge. We will not remand the proceedings. The Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable and denying her application for voluntary departure is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Presumably, the respondent’s contention is that the Immigration Judge should have found her removable from the United States for fraud or misrepresentation pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas D. Nelson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathan Grant
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
AMENDED ORDER
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on August 26, 2008, when we denied the respondent’s second motion to reopen, filed on June 16, 2008. However, the record reflects that the respondent had also filed a motion to reconsider on April 16, 2008, which was pending at the time and which we did not explicitly and separately address in our decision. We are therefore reopening proceedings on our own motion to include an adjudication of the respondent’s motion to reconsider. Moreover, given that the law which served as the basis of our denial of the motion to reopen has since changed, we will vacate our prior order in its entirety and issue the following decision.
 
The respondent’s April 16, 2008, motion to reconsider will be denied. The respondent sought reconsideration of our March 18, 2008, decision denying his December 3, 2007, motion to reopen as untimely. In his motion to reopen, the respondent had argued that sua sponte reopening was warranted based upon the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2005), which held that lawful admission and legal permanent residence of a parent could be imputed to a minor child to satisfy the continuous residence requirement for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(2). We declined to reopen sua sponte, given that the case had been published more than 2 years prior to the untimely filing of the motion. We find no reason to disturb that determination. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2; see Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Accordingly, the motion to reconsider will be denied, as we find no error in our decision as based upon the record before us at that time.
 
However, the respondent’s June 16, 2008, motion to reopen will be granted. In that motion, the respondent asserts that the failure to timely reopen was due to the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. In our August 26, 2008, decision, we denied the motion to reopen, finding that Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, supra, was no longer binding on the Board in light of our explicit disagreement with that case in Matter of Ramirez-Vargas, 24 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 2008) and Matter of Escobar, 24 I&N Dec. 231 (BIA 2007). However, since that time, the Ninth Circuit has reaffirmed its holding in Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, supra, finding the Board’s contrary interpretation to be unreasonable. See Mercado-Zazueta v. Holder, 580 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir. 2009). The Ninth Circuit noted that although agencies retain discretion to determine ambiguous statutes, an agency may not “resurrect a statutory interpretation that a circuit court has foreclosed by rejecting it as unreasonable.” Id. at 1114; see also Matter of Diaz and Lopez, 25 I&N Dec. 188, 190 (BIA 2010) (acknowledging same). Therefore, as the respondent claims to have been residing in the United States since 1992 with his father, who was a lawful permanent resident and is now a United States citizen, he appears to be statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal.
 
*2 Although the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) challenges the motion as time-barred and number-barred under the regulations, we find that equitable tolling of the filing deadline is warranted. The respondent asserts that his former counsel erred in failing to file a timely motion to reopen after Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, supra, was issued. We note that the respondent has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Moreover, we accept the respondent’s rationale for not filing a bar complaint. Former counsel has submitted an affidavit admitting his error, and the respondent’s current attorney attests to the prior attorney’s complete cooperation in remedying the oversight. Moreover, the respondent reports that his former attorney had performed work for the respondent beyond their contract without remuneration (June 16, 2008, Motion to Reopen, 4-7).
 
Therefore, as the respondent has shown that he was “prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error,” the deadline will be equitably tolled and his motion is deemed timely. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003); see also Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1185-86 (9th Cir. 2004). Notably, the DHS has presented no argument opposing equitable tolling. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The Board’s August 26, 2008, order is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s April 16, 2008, motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s June 16, 2008, motion to reopen is hereby granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se¿FN1º
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joey L. Caccarozzo
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed an Immigration Judge’s December 16, 2008, denial of her motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including any determination of credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of H-L-H- & Z-Y-Z-, 25 I&N Dec. 209, 211 (BIA 2010).
 
On November 7, 2007, the respondent was ordered removed to Kenya after having failed to comply with biometric requirements. She filed a motion to reopen on November 14, 2007, which the Immigration Judge granted on December 3, 2007. On July 17, 2008, the Immigration Judge deemed the respondent’s application for adjustment of status to have been withdrawn, but granted her voluntary departure. The respondent filed a second motion to reopen on November 14, 2008, which the Immigration Judge denied on December 16, 2008. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of this untimely and number-barred motion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
In her second motion to reopen and on appeal, the respondent has alleged the ineffective assistance of two prior counsels. However, in making these allegations, she failed to meet any of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 851F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). That is, she failed, even on appeal, to submit an affidavit detailing the agreements she had with her prior counsels, to assert that the prior counsels have been informed of the allegations leveled against them and been given an opportunity to respond, or to confirm that bar complaints have been filed against the prior counsels, or alternatively, explain why such complaints have not been filed. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639; Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741, 745-46 (4th Cir. 2006).
 
The respondent also argued on appeal that, in addition to the requirements of Matter of Lozada, the Immigration Judge appeared to require a showing that the prior counsels were not in “good standing” with the Immigration Court (Respondent’s Brief at 4-6; I.J. at 1). However, our reading of the Immigration Judge’s order is not that he added such a requirement for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, but rather that he just noted in passing that both of the prior counsels were generally considered to be in good standing in his court. In any event, whether or not these attorneys were in “good standing” has no bearing on whether the respondent has otherwise fulfilled the Lozada requirements.
 
*2 Further, in the absence of egregious circumstances, an alien is bound by the “reasonable tactical actions” of his or her counsel. Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938 (BIA 1995). Based on the respondent’s allegations, we are unable to conclude that the actions of either of her prior counsels were egregious. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). Finally, we conclude that the circumstances of this case do not warrant sua sponte reopening.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The record contains a motion by Ms. Regina Njogu, the attorney who assisted the respondent in filing her appeal before the Board, seeking to withdraw as attorney of record. As the attorney’s motion conforms with the requirements Matter of Rosales, 19 I&N Dec. 655 (BIA 1988), we will grant the motion, consider the respondent pro se, and issue a courtesy copy of our decision to Ms. Njogu.

File: AXXX XX5 057 - Dallas, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Justine M. Daly, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cynthia D. Goodman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 20, 2009, denial of his motion to reconsider a January 5, 2009, Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The respondent sought reopening of an order dated September 10, 2008, in which the Immigration Judge found the respondent had not requested any form of relief, that no relief was available to him, and ordered him removed to Mexico. The respondent waived appeal. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. On January 5, 2009, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen because the respondent had not established that he was prima facie eligible for relief. The respondent filed a January 28, 2009, motion to reconsider. Based on the motion to reconsider, the Immigration Judge entered a new decision on March 20, 2009, correcting a legal error. However, the motion was again denied because the respondent failed to demonstrate he was prima facie eligible for relief. We now consider the respondent’s appeal of that decision.
 
A motion to reopen for the purpose of providing the alien an opportunity to apply for any form of discretionary relief will not be granted if it appears that the alien’s right to apply for such relief was fully explained to him or her by the Immigration Judge and an opportunity to apply therefore was afforded at the hearing, unless the relief is sought on the basis of circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). The respondent has made no showing of new circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the Immigration Judge’s decision. However, the respondent argues on appeal that if not for the ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent would have filed the appropriate applications for relief with the Immigration Judge. The respondent further argues that he is prima facie eligible for the relief requested and reopening is appropriate. Respondent’s brief at 15, 17.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998). Based on the documentation presented, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent has met the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 However, the Immigration Judge denied reopening because the respondent had not demonstrated that he was prejudiced as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Specifically, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent was not prima facie eligible for relief and would not have prevailed at a hearing. The respondent argues that he is eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(d)(11) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(11). The respondent concedes that he was convicted on July 18, 2007, in the United States District Court, Western District of Texas, Del Rio Division, for the offense of aiding and abetting the attempted illegal entry of an alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(3) and 18 U.S.C. § 2. Based on this conviction, the respondent is removable as an alien who knowingly encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the United States in violation of law pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i). However, the respondent argues that the aliens he was assisting in entering the country were his step children and he is eligible for consideration of a waiver under section 212(d)(11) of the Act. The respondent offers a Declaration and Registration of Informal Marriage, to support his contention that under the laws of Texas he was common law married when he brought his step children into the United States illegally. The Immigration Judge found that the evidence was not sufficient to indicate that a common law marriage existed at the time of the respondent’s July 7, 2007, arrest because although the document states that the marriage began prior to the incident on January 7, 2007, the declaration was not executed until April 7, 2008 (I.J. at 6).
 
The marriage of a man and woman in Texas may be proven by evidence that a declaration of their marriage has been signed. See Texas Family Code section 2.401(a)(1). Furthermore, the Texas courts have found that a declaration of marriage constitutes prima facie proof of the parties’ informal marriage. See Russell v. Russell, 865 S.W. 2d 929, 931 (Tex. 1993); Husband v. Pierce, 800 S.W. 2d 661 (Tex. 1990) (declaration is a prima facie showing of union). Therefore, we find that the Immigration Judge erred in not finding the respondent had provided prima facie evidence of his eligibility for the section 212(d)(11) waiver. The evidence sufficiently demonstrated the respondent had been prejudiced by his former attorney’s ineffective assistance. Based on this evidence, we will remand to the Immigration Judge for initial consideration of the respondent’s eligibility for the claimed waiver.
 
*3 We note that although the respondent has provided sufficient evidence to support reopening, the evidence does not necessarily establish the required family relationship for a section 212(d)(11) waiver. Section 2.401 of the Texas Family Code provides only that a marriage may be proven by evidence of a signed declaration, not that the marriage is definitively established by such a declaration. The Texas courts have held that they are not bound to find a marriage as stated in a declaration when there is evidence to the contrary. See Colburn v. The State of Texas, 966 S. W. 2d 511 (Tex. 1998). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s factual finding that since the declaration of marriage was executed subsequent to the respondent’s arrest for alien smuggling, there is some evidence in the record that does not support an informal marriage was created on January 7, 2007 (I.J. at 5). Therefore, on remand the Immigration Judge will consider additional evidence, make explicit fact finding and conduct additional legal analysis as to whether a common law marriage had been established by July 7, 2007.
 
Furthermore, we note that eligibility for a section 212(d)(11) waiver is not based solely upon the establishment of the claimed relationship. See Matter of Compean, 21 I&N Dec. 51 (BIA 1995). Rather, the respondent must establish that such a grant is for humanitarian reasons, to assure family unity, or is otherwise in the public interest. See section 212(d)(11) of the Act; Matter of Compean, supra.
 
Finally, we find no basis to remand to a different Immigration Judge, as requested by the respondent. We have reviewed the contention by the respondent that the Immigration Judge has demonstrated bias in this matter. This contention, without further support, is insufficient to justify remand to another Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judge has conducted these proceedings in a generally fair way, and we see no persuasive evidence of bias on the part of the Immigration Judge, such as to require a remand to a different Immigration Judge. See Matter of G-, 20 I&N Dec. 764, 781 (BIA 1993). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul S. Zolton, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case is before us pursuant to an order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granting an unopposed motion to remand the record. In a decision dated October 30, 2009, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal, but failed to directly address the respondent’s motion to remand the record. The respondent has also filed a motion to reopen the proceedings based on the ineffective assistance of previous counsel. The motion will be granted and the record remanded for further proceedings and the entry of a new decision.
 
We review the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether or not the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
The respondent argues that her previous attorney failed to timely submit evidence that was material to her case. In our previous decision, we noted that this particular document was not important due to some problems with the testimony concerning how it was obtained. The respondent has now submitted additional evidence bolstering the importance of this document and an affidavit from her former attorney stating that he erred in not submitting this document earlier. The respondent has substantially complied with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). In addition to this, the respondent has now also submitted additional support for her claim, some of which was not available at the time of the previous hearing and appears material to her claim.
 
Based on the ineffective assistance of counsel, the new and material evidence the respondent has submitted, as well as, the request of the Fourth Circuit, we will reopen the proceedings and remand the record for the Immigration Judge to consider the respondent’s statutory’ eligibility for relief and whether or not discretion should be exercised on her behalf.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted and the record remanded for further proceedings.

File: AXXX XX6 548 - Las Vegas, NV
November 3, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William F. Levings, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christian Parke
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent appealed from the June 30, 2010, oral decision of the Immigration Judge, which found him removable; determined that he did not apply for, and did not demonstrate eligibility for, any relief from removal; and ordered him removed from the United States to the Philippines. While his appeal was pending, he filed a motion to remand. The motion to remand will be granted, and the record will be remanded.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly found that the respondent was removable based on the charge in the Form I-261 charging document, as convicted of an aggravated felony under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), in conjunction with sections 101(a)(43)(G) and 101(a)(43)(U) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(G) and 1101(a)(43)(U). As substantiated by conviction documents, the respondent has a 2006 Nevada conviction upon a guilty plea for conspiracy to commit burglary. For that crime, he was sentenced to imprisonment of 1 year, with imposition of sentence suspended subject to completion of probation, originally. The prison sentence was imposed subsequently, upon probation revocation in 2008. The respondent was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on or about February 10, 1988. The Immigration Judge indicated that the respondent did not wish to apply for any form of removal relief, based on his statements through counsel at his hearing (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 42).
 
On appeal and in his motion to remand, the respondent argues that his conviction is invalid because he entered a defective guilty plea based on ineffective assistance from criminal counsel. However, the fact that he may be pursuing post-conviction relief in the form of a collateral attack on that conviction in state criminal court does not affect its finality for federal immigration purposes. See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992). The respondent has presented no evidence with this appeal that any attack on his conviction has resulted in any vacatur. His speculation that his conviction might be invalid does not change the finality for immigration purposes of such conviction, unless and until it were to be overturned by a criminal court. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996).
 
Further, the respondent asserts that he now wishes to apply on remand for withholding of removal under the Act and for protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (“CAT”). We observe that he stands convicted of conspiracy to commit burglary. Since the respondent was sentenced to imprisonment of 1 year for his theft offense, he has been convicted of an aggravated felony. As an aggravated felon, the respondent is statutorily ineligible for asylum under the Act. See sections 208(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 208(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 1158(b)(2)(B)(i). To demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal under the Act, the respondent would have to establish that, if he were to return to the Philippines, it is more likely than not that he would be subjected to persecution on account of a statutory ground. See section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3). To demonstrate eligibility for CAT protection, the respondent would have to prove that, if removed to the Philippines, he would more likely than not be tortured at the instigation or with the acquiescence (to include the concept of willful blindness) of a public official acting in his or her official capacity. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c)(2) and 1208.18(a)(1) (2010). He alleges that he fears returning to the Philippines because he believes that his father, who served in the military and as a police officer, was murdered in 2004 by his enemies for political reasons. The respondent has submitted a completed Form I-589 application accompanied by four affidavits, his own September 2010 affidavit and July 2010 affidavits from two relatives and an acquaintance.
 
*2 In addition, the respondent maintains that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorney who represented him in his removal proceedings. In his affidavit and motion, he states that his former attorney did not consult with him before telling the Immigration Judge that there was no relief available to him; did not raise his expressed fear of returning to the Philippines with the Immigration Judge; did not submit a brief even after the Immigration Judge afforded him two extra weeks to do so; did not proffer any reason for not submitting the brief; did not visit him in detention; and rarely spoke to him at his hearings. We find that the respondent has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), as he has submitted his own affidavit and a copy of a complaint that was filed with the State Bar of Nevada and also was sent to his prior attorney. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009).
 
Under the circumstances of this case, we find it appropriate to grant the motion to remand so that the respondent’s claims for withholding of removal and CAT protection may be evaluated by the Immigration Judge. Since we have granted the motion to remand, we need not reach the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim and need not determine whether he has demonstrated prejudice from counsel’s alleged action or inaction pursuant to Matter of Lozada, supra, as we expect that the respondent will have the opportunity to present fully his withholding and CAT claims, the inaction regarding which underlies his ineffective assistance claim. See Aguilar-Ramos v. Holder, 594 F.3d 701 (9th Cir. 2010). On remand, both the respondent and the Department of Homeland Security may introduce any and all available evidence that is relevant to his eligibility for withholding of removal and CAT protection.¿FN1º
 
Accordingly, we will grant the motion to remand and will remand the record.
 
ORDER: The motion to remand is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings and for the issuance of a new decision, consistent with this opinion.

IN RE: MARIA REINOSO-POAQUIZA
File: AXXX XX3 125 - New York, NY
November 3, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anita Delgado, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Leigh Mapplebeck
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the April 7, 2010, decision of the Immigration Judge denying her motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, was placed in removal proceedings in 1997 and conceded removability (see Exh. 1). On July 8, 1998, the respondent failed to appear at a hearing and was ordered removed in absentia. On October 26, 1998, an Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s motion to reopen the proceedings. The respondent’s counsel was subsequently issued notice that the respondent should appear for a hearing on March 30, 1999. On that date, neither the respondent nor her counsel appeared, and another in absentia order was entered.
 
In October 2003, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a motion to reopen asserting that her prior counsel, whose name she could not recall, informed her that she did not need to appear for her removal hearing. She explained her husband was the beneficiary of an approved Form I-140, and she wanted to pursue adjustment of status. On November 3, 2003, the Immigration Judge denied the motion finding that the hearing notice had been properly issued to the respondent’s counsel, and that the respondent did not present evidence to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, including her own statement. The Immigration Judge pointed out that several years had passed since the in absentia hearing, and the respondent knew she had been placed in proceedings.
 
On March 12, 2010, the respondent filed another motion to reopen, this time supported by her own declaration claiming she did not receive notice of her hearing. She reiterated her desire to apply for adjustment of status and submitted supporting documentation. On April 7, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied the motion finding that the respondent did not establish exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear.
 
The respondent has filed this appeal. She again claims her prior counsel never advised her of her hearing date, and she because he is deceased, she cannot comply with the documentary requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. She asserts that the 180-day limit for filing a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances should be equitably tolled. She emphasizes that she also seeks reopening based on previously unavailable evidence supporting her eligibility for adjustment of status.
 
We will not disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision. In her 2003 motion, the respondent blamed her failure to appear on her prior counsel, but did not submit evidence which satisfied any of the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). She did not adequately remedy this deficiency in her 2010 motion, wherein she provided a statement that she did not receive her notice of hearing but provided no explanation regarding her relationship with prior counsel. Both of the motions were also untimely as they were filed outside of the 180-day limit for motions to reopen based on exceptional circumstances for a failure to appear. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). The respondent’s failure to properly support her motions, as well as her several year delay in filing her first motion without sufficient explanation, preclude reopening under an equitable tolling theory. See Aris v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595 (2d Cir. 2008); Wang v. BIA, 508 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir. 2007). Finally, the respondent’s argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that prior counsel is deceased does not excuse her failure to submit adequate documentation earlier in the proceedings. Setting aside the in absentia issues, insofar as the respondent’s motion is based on previously unavailable relief and new evidence, it is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998).
 
*2 We conclude that the respondent has not set forth any basis for reopening her removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: MAKLIN ALEXIS RIVERA-RODRIGUEZ
File: AXXX XX8 849 - Chicago, IL
November 2, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marisa Aguilar, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order in these proceedings on February 6, 2008. On October 8, 2010, the respondent filed this untimely motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent seeks reopening to apply for relief from removal, including adjustment of status as the spouse of a United States citizen.¿FN1º It does not appear that any exception to the filing deadline applies to this motion, however. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). See also Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 105 (BIA 2009) (untimely motions to reopen to apply for adjustment of status generally do not fall within any of the statutory or regulatory exceptions for motions to reopen and are generally denied). Nor do we find that equitable tolling of the filing deadline based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is warranted in this case. See Ajose v. Gonzales, 408 F.3d 393, 395 (7th Cir.2005) (holding that the administrative time-limit on motions to reopen is non-jurisdictional and subject to equitable tolling); Pervaiz v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 488 (7th Cir. 2005) (recognizing equitable tolling in cases of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
The respondent raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, alleging, inter alia, that his former attorney failed to notify him of the Board’s prior order. The respondent, however, has not complied with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before this Board as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Patel v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 829 (7th Cir. 2007) (holding that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying an alien’s motion to reopen where the alien failed to fulfill the Lozada requirements). He has failed, therefore, to set forth a viable ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his former attorney.
 
Finally, we find no exceptional situation present in this case to persuade us to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen the proceedings on our own motion. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). While we recognize that the respondent’s removal will likely result in hardship to the respondent and his family, we emphasize that we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, “treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999).
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Particia Vargas, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jennifer W. Smith
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, timely requests reopening asserting that the ineffective assistance of his former counsel warrants further hearings on the issue of hardship to his qualifying relatives, four United States citizen children, for purposes of cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The motion will be denied.
 
Notwithstanding his assertion that his former attorney failed to submit evidence relating to country conditions in Mexico, the respondent has not proffered additional new evidence satisfying his “heavy burden” of demonstrating that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-74 (BIA 1992); Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N 413 (BIA 1996); Matter of Andazola, 23 I&N Dec. 319 (BIA 2002) (describing exceptional and extremely unusual hardship). The respondent’s generalized claim of violence in Mexico does not sufficiently demonstrate hardship that is substantially different from, or beyond, that which would normally be expected upon returning with a parent to the parent’s country of citizenship, which may be a less developed country. See Matter of Monreal, 23 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2001). We acknowledge the present difficult conditions in Mexico, including the widespread violence there. However, the respondent has not sufficiently shown that his children would be left unprotected from harm or violence in Mexico.
 
Under the circumstances, we do not find the respondent’s assertion regarding his former attorney’s alleged action or inaction sufficient to demonstrate prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Nor has the respondent sufficiently complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
On this record, the respondent has not demonstrated that further hearings are warranted. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

File: AXXX XX5 340 - San Antonio, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher J. Stender, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Justin Adams
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on June 21, 2005, after failing to appear at a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on July 8, 2009, and the Immigration Judge denied it on July 22, 2009. The respondent filed a second motion to reopen on May 10, 2010. The Immigration Judge denied it on July 12, 2010, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision sets out the history of this case. Underlying both of the respondent’s motions is his claim that he did not receive proper notice of his hearing. The respondent did not give an address at the time his Notice to Appear (NTA) was served upon him, and he did not subsequently provide the Immigration Court with an address. Therefore, the respondent was not entitled to receive actual notice of his hearing. See section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(5)(B); Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d 354 (5th Cir. 2009), and the in absentia hearing was appropriate. The respondent emphasizes that he was only 17 years old when the NTA was served. However, the regulations provide that he was old enough to receive service of the NTA. See 8 C.F.R. § 103.5a(c)(ii). Moreover, the respondent was accompanied by his adult sister at the time of service (see Exhs 1, 2). Once served, it became incumbent on the respondent to provide an address where he was able to receive notices. As he did not do so, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish a basis for reopening based on a lack of proper notice of the in absentia hearing.
 
Insofar as the respondent raises issues outside of the notice of his hearing, he faces jurisdictional barriers as he acknowledges being removed from the United States on or about September 27, 2009, pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s June 21, 2005, decision (See R’s 2010 appeal brief at 4; 2010 motion to reopen at 4).¿FN1º See Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008); cf. Matter of Bulnes, 25 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 2009) (holding that an alien’s departure from the United States while under an outstanding order of deportation or removal issued in absentia does not deprive the Immigration Judge of jurisdiction to entertain a motion to reopen to rescind the order if the motion is premised upon lack of notice).
 
Additionally, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) provides that an alien may file only one motion to seek reopening of an order of removal entered in absentia. This is the respondent’s second motion to reopen. In this regard, even entertaining the respondent’s argument that his first motion was prepared with ineffective assistance of counsel and number and time bars should not be triggered, we respond that he has not satisfied the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 638 (BIA 1988); see also De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879 (5th Cir. 2004); Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001). Finally, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established any basis for reopening his proceedings under the William Wilberfore Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA). Most notably, the respondent was in fact accompanied at time of his 2005 entry by his sister, who had reached the age of majority, and placed in her custody; he was also traveling to see his parents who lived in Georgia. The respondent otherwise cites no specific provision of the TVPRA which would dictate that these proceedings should be reopened. Finally, we find no merit to the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge was obliged to advise the respondent of potential eligibility for relief in the context of denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. Cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.11(a), (c) (referring to Immigration Judge’s duties during a hearing).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rosalind Kelly, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s May 25, 2010, decision, ordering him removed. The respondent has also requested that we remand the record based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal will be dismissed as waived and the motion to remand will be denied.
 
The record reflects that the respondent waived appeal. The Immigration Judge asked the respondent’s counsel if appeal was reserved or waived (Tr. at 5). Counsel replied, at first, that “he’s not instructed me one way or the other.” Id. The respondent was asked if he wished to accept the Immigration Judge’s decision or if he wished to appeal, and the respondent replied that “It’s fine. It’s okay” (Tr. at 6). The Immigration Judge then asked respondent’s counsel if he accepted that as a waiver, and respondent’s counsel replied in the affirmative. Id. The Immigration Judge noted at the bottom of his memorandum decision that both parties waived appeal. The respondent asserts on appeal that his waiver of appeal was unknowing and requests a remand. While the respondent submitted an affidavit on appeal, his only statement regarding the waiver is that counsel did not preserve his appeal rights. The respondent does not state that he did not understand that he was waiving appeal when he, his counsel, and the Immigration Judge discussed the issue. Although the respondent claims that his former counsel was ineffective, this claim is unavailing. To establish a meritorious ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must first comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000). Here, the respondent has failed to comply with the requirements that he inform former counsel of the allegations he is lodging against him, as well as notify the state bar disciplinary authority. Furthermore, he has not established a factual basis on which we could conclude that the former counsel was ineffective, and he has not established any prejudice from the asserted ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed as waived.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on August 27, 2010, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely. On September 27, 20010, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider our denial of his motion to reopen. The motion to reconsider will be denied, and the respondent’s stay request also is denied.
 
A motion to reconsider is “a request that the Board reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change in law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked.” Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57 (BIA 2006). A motion to reconsider challenges the Board’s original decision and alleges that it is defective in some regard. Id According to section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C), a motion to reconsider must specify the errors of fact or law in a prior Board decision, and it must be supported by pertinent authority. See section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Act; see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1).
 
The respondent’s motion does not meet these requirements. Specifically, the respondent has not identified an error of fact or law in our prior ruling. The respondent instead has offered additional information regarding the merits and progress of the post-conviction motion he has filed in his criminal proceedings. To the extent that the respondent’s motion contains new evidence for consideration, the motion is a motion to reopen. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 57-58. The respondent, however, has already filed one motion to reopen, and his current motion was filed well past the time limit for filing a motion to reopen. The motion to reopen therefore is untimely and numerically barred. See sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Act.
 
*2 In addition, the respondent has not established that his motion fits within one of the exceptions to the time and number limits. See sections 240(c)(7)(C)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of the Act; see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i) - (iv). Moreover, as we noted in our prior decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, the respondent has not claimed that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel during his immigration proceedings. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding that the deadline for motions to reopen may be equitably tolled on the basis of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel provided the alien acts with due diligence); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (setting forth requirements for establishing entitlement to reopening on the basis of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
Finally, the respondent has not established that sua sponte reopening of his proceedings is warranted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (indicating that this Board may grant sua sponte reopening in its discretion when exceptional circumstances exist). The respondent claims that he was denied due process due to his criminal attorney’s failure to consider and advise him of the immigration consequences of his guilty pleas. The respondent argues that the guilty pleas made him removable and ineligible for relief from removal, and he asserts that a criminal court is on the verge of overturning his convictions on the basis of Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010). He therefore claims that his proceedings should be reopened and stayed so that he may pursue relief from removal and avoid irreparable harm.
 
The respondent’s assertion that some or all of his convictions might be invalidated in the near future, however, does not alter the fact that his convictions are final for immigration purposes unless and until they are actually overturned by a criminal court. See, e.g., Matter of Ponce de Leon-Ruiz, 21 I&N Dec. 154, 156-7 (BIA 1996) (finding that the availability of post-conviction motions or other forms of collateral attack does not affect the finality of a conviction for immigration purposes); see also Montilla v. INS, 926 F.2d 162, 164 (2d Cir. 1991). Neither this Board nor the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction to consider a collateral attack on a conviction or to question the validity of a final conviction. See, e.g., Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). Accordingly, as we stated in our earlier ruling, the respondent’s assertion that his convictions could be overturned in the near future, standing alone, does not provide a proper basis for granting his untimely motion to reopen. We therefore deny the respondent’s motion to reconsider, and we deny what we have construed to constitute a motion to reopen as untimely.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: To the extent that the respondent’s motion to reconsider also constitutes a motion to reopen, it is denied as untimely.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s stay request is denied.

IN RE: EDWIN EDGARDO MOREIRA LINO A.K.A. EDWIN MOREIRA
File: AXXX XX2 437 - New York, NY
October 28, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hedwin Salmen-Navarro, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
In a decision dated May 12, 2010, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia on April 2, 2008. The respondent has appealed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is a 26-year-old native and citizen of Honduras. He entered the United States on or about February 1993. The Notice to Appear was issued on January 22, 2007. He did not appear at the hearing on April 2, 2008, despite having been in court when the hearing date was set. The respondent filed a motion to rescind the in absentia order and to reopen proceedings on May 3, 2010, over 2 years after the hearing, in order to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen for lack of prejudice and lack of due diligence. The Board denied his request for a stay. The respondent was removed on July 12, 2010.
 
Under the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d), a motion to reopen shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of exclusion, deportation or removal proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States. In Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008), the Board found that a motion to reopen is barred by the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2, and the Immigration Judge and the Board do not have jurisdiction over the motion, where the alien has left the United States after he is placed into immigration proceedings. Xue Yong Zhang v. Holder, 617 F.3d 650 (2d Cir. 2010) (departure bar limits Board’s sua sponte jurisdiction over motion to reopen); see Ovalles v. Holder, 577 F.3d 288 (5th Cir. 2009).
 
In Matter of Bulnes-Nolasco, 25 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 2009), the Board held an alien could file a motion to rescind an in absentia order of exclusion, deportation, or removal to address whether an alien received sufficient notice of an in absentia deportation hearing. See Xue Yong Zhang, supra, at 8 n. 10 (distinguishing Bulnes-Nolasco). Under the statute, an order of removal can be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed at any time, if the alien demonstrated that he did not receive notice. See Contreras-Rodriguez v. United States Attorney General, 462 F.3d 1314 (11th Cir. 2006); 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The Immigration Judge found the respondent received sufficient notice because he was present when the hearing date was set. Further, he did not explain why he did not appear on April 4, 2008, if he thought that was the correct hearing date, and he did not exercise due diligence in filing a motion to reopen 2 years after the Immigration Judge’s decision.¿FN1º
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent argues that he has shown exceptional circumstances prevented him from appearing in that he was subject to ineffective assistance of counsel. He submitted evidence that the organization for which his attorney worked, the International Professional Association, has been sued by the State of New York for fraud and malfeasance. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). He also states he has a mental deficiency as the result of a car accident. However, a motion to rescind on account of exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s order.

The respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, and he has not shown due diligence. See e.g. Rashid v.

The motion does not contain an affidavit or statement from the respondent regarding these events. To the extent that the respondent has concerns over his memory, he has not shown what steps he took to clarify the hearing date, and hence has not made a case that his failure to attend resulted from circumstances “beyond the control of the alien.” Section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sherna G. Spencer, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a female native and citizen of Jamaica, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 2, 2009, denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia on April 15, 2009, and in a decision dated August 27, 2009, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
Upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not established that proceedings should be reopened. There is no issue regarding whether the respondent knew that she had a scheduled removal hearing. Thus, the respondent had notice of her hearing and can seek reopening of proceedings solely upon the basis of exceptional circumstances. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). In this case, the respondent claims that she failed to appear because she mistakenly relied on the advice of an immigration consultant. However, the respondent does not claim that the consultant held herself out to be an attorney, nor does the respondent claim that she believed the consultant was an attorney. We therefore find that the respondent has not established exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear. See Hernandez v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 1014, 1020 (9th Cir. 2008) (noting that an alien’s knowing reliance on a non-attorney’s advice will not support a due process violation); Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, 327 F.3d 892, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that there is a crucial difference between ineffective assistance of counsel and ineffective assistance of an immigration consultant).
 
In addition, even if the respondent believed that the immigration consultant was an attorney or held herself out as such, her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not satisfy the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 514 F.3d 1224, 1225-26 (11th Cir. 2008) (suggesting that Lozada applies to ineffective assistance of counsel claims rendered by non-attorneys); Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”). We therefore find no reason to disturb the decision of the Immigration Judge.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX7 681 - Miami, FL
October 26, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sandra Echevarria, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 29, 2009, denying his motion to reopen proceedings so that he may pursue his application for adjustment of status, pursuant to a Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) filed by his United States citizen wife. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility made by the Immigration Judge, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2010). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008).
 
A motion to reopen will not be granted unless evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available or could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). The respondent argues that his new evidence is the Form I-130 filed by his wife, as well as his application for adjustment of status (Form I-485) (Respondent’s Br. at 3). However, as the respondent himself concedes, these documents were filed with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in 1997 (Respondent’s Br. at 3). He did not establish that this information was not available or could not have been presented at the hearing. Accordingly, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion to reopen.
 
The respondent argues that he has a “colorable claim” to ineffective assistance of counsel by the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Judge, because that attorney did not notify the Immigration Judge of the respondent’s eligibility for adjustment of status. However, the respondent chose not to comply with the procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance (Respondent’s Br. at 11-12; I.J. at 2). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
In his decision dated March 23, 2009, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent post-conclusion voluntary departure. The respondent requests that if the Board does not grant his motion to reopen, we alternatively reinstate the grant of voluntary departure, or order his bond returned to him. As the respondent acknowledges, a filing of a motion to reopen prior to the expiration of the period allowed for voluntary departure serves to automatically terminate the grant of voluntary departure. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1). Thus, we do not have discretion to reinstate voluntary departure. The previously-entered voluntary departure order will be vacated. Further, we do not have jurisdiction to order the return of the posted bond, as that is in the purview of the Department of Homeland Security. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(4).
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s order granting voluntary departure, dated March 23, 2009, is vacated, and the alternative order of removal is in effect.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
CERTIFICATION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Timothy L. Cook, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand
  
ORDER:
 
*1 We accept the respondent’s appeal on certification because he has satisfactorily demonstrated that his prior counsel did not mail him a copy of the Immigration Judge’s written decision in time to file a timely appeal. The respondent has filed a motion to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for a new evidentiary hearing based on a claim that he was also provided ineffective assistance of counsel at his hearing before the Immigration Judge. The Department of Homeland Security did not file an appeal brief or a response to the motion to remand. We therefore deem the respondent’s request for a new hearing to be unopposed. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The respondent has substantially complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The record supports the respondent’s argument that his prior counsel was unprepared to address the lodged charged of removability under section 212(a)(9)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(C), and that she had not adequately prepared the respondent for the hearing (Tr. at 6). See generally Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2006). The DHS stated at the August 12, 2008, hearing its intention to file the section 212(a)(9)(C) charge, yet counsel appeared to be ill equipped to address it at the subsequent hearing more than a year later. However, we also note that there is some question as to whether the DHS properly served written notice of the lodged charge (Form 1-261) to counsel’s correct address prior to the final hearing on September 15, 2009 (Tr. at 6, 8-12). See 8 C.F.R. 1240.10(e).
 
Upon consideration of the totality of the circumstances presented here, including the lack of an opposition from the DHS, we will grant the motion to remand. Accordingly, we grant the motion and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for a new hearing on the respondent’s removability and eligibility for relief.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lawrence N. Etah, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The final administrative decision in this matter was entered by the Board on February 27, 2009, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On March 16, 2010, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen, but urges that equitable tolling of the time limits is warranted because he received ineffective assistance of counsel from his prior attorneys, and from another person who held himself out to be an attorney. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be granted.
 
We find that the respondent has established that equitable tolling of the motion time limits is warranted in this case. Cecik v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000). His motion complies with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (Motion, tabs 2 & 3), and establishes that he has been prejudiced by attorney Arthur Wemegah’s actions.¿FN1º Specifically, the respondent presents evidence that a visa petition filed by his current wife was approved in November 2008, while his appeal was still pending with the Board (Motion, tab 7). A copy of this decision was sent to attorney Wemegah, who was representing the respondent before the Board (Motion, tab 7). Attorney Wemegah, however, did not file a motion to remand with the Board requesting that the respondent be allowed to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). Nor, after the Board issued its February 2009 decision, did attorney Wemegah file a timely motion to reopen or advise the respondent of the need to file such a motion within 90 days of the Board’s decision. Had such a motion been filed, it would likely have been granted, since the visa petition had already been approved, and the respondent appears prima facie eligible for adjustment of status.
 
The respondent has also demonstrated his diligence in raising this claim. He presents evidence that after his appeal was dismissed, he sought further representation. The person with whom he consulted held himself out to be an attorney and advised the respondent to file an adjustment application with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which the respondent did in August 2009 (Motion, tab 7). It was only after he was later detained by the USCIS and received a notice advising him that the adjustment application would not be processed due to the outstanding removal order that he discovered this person was not an attorney and sought out new counsel.
 
*2 Under the circumstances, we find the respondent has demonstrated that equitable tolling of the motions time limit is warranted, and we will grant the motion to reopen to allow the respondent an opportunity to apply for adjustment of status based on his marriage to a United States citizen, on the basis of which a visa petition has been approved.¿FN2º
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

Although the respondent presents claims against other prior attorneys and a non-attorney, we need only address the claims against attorney Wemegah, who represented him at the last two hearings below and on appeal to the Board.

A self-petition as a battered spouse (Form I-360) was also approved by the USCIS on the respondent’s behalf in May 2010 (Supplemental Submission, attachment). It is not entirely clear whether this petition relates to his current marriage or his prior marriage. In either event, it appears the respondent has a visa immediately available to him, whether based on the approved I-130 or the approved I-360.

Appeal
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
David K.S. Kim, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondents in this matter consist of a mother (AXXX XXX XXX) and her two children (AXXX XXX XXX and 952), all natives and citizens of South Korea.¿FN1º The respondent timely appeals a July 22, 2008, decision by the Immigration Judge which granted the respondent’s motion to withdraw voluntary departure, but denied reopening his February 26, 2008, decision, which granted voluntary departure, with an alternate order of removal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2009). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
In his February 26, 2008, decision, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent a period of voluntary departure to June 25, 2008. The respondent filed motions to withdraw voluntary departure and to reopen on June 24, 2008, i.e., within the voluntary departure time allotted. Thus, under Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U.S. 1 (2008), the Immigration Judge was correct in granting the respondent’s motion to withdraw voluntary departure (I.J. at 3).
 
However, the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s February 26, 2008, decision, and was thus untimely. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent asserts that the motion to reopen is not untimely because her order of removal did not become final until her voluntary departure time expired on June 25, 2008 (Respondent’s Brief at 8). However, she has provided no authority for this argument and we decline to accept it. See Matter of Goolcharan, 23 I&N Dec. 5 (BIA 2001).¿FN2º
 
The respondent asserts that even though her motion was untimely, the time limitation for filing it was equitably tolled because she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel and prejudiced thereby (Motion to Reopen at 2-4; Exh. A of Motion to Reopen; Respondent’s Brief at 8-10). She filed four different adjustment of status applications, all of which were denied by USCIS. Her most recent application was denied on November 23, 2007, because she had not been out of a valid nonimmigrant status for 180 days or less, as required by Section 245(k) of the Act (Exh. G of Motion to Reopen). She was represented by Sae-Jung Lee of You & Associates at the time of her most recent adjustment of status application, and alleges that he did not inform her that she could challenge the USCIS finding before the Immigration Court. She was thereafter represented by Shinyun Ki of You & Associates, and claims that Ms. Ki did not explain all of the respondent’s options available to her when she took voluntary departure in February 2008. However, in claiming ineffective assistance of counsel against Mr. Lee and Ms. Ki, the respondent has not complied with any of the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (I.J. at 3-4; Respondent’s Brief at 8-10).
 
*2 Even if timely, we agree that the respondent’s motion to reopen did not specify which new facts would be proven at his hearing (I.J. at 4). The governing regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3) require that a motion to reopen “state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.” The respondent did not comply with this requirement, and therefore her request to reopen was appropriately denied.
 
We disagree with the respondent’s contention that pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.11(a)(2) the Immigration Judge should have informed the respondent that she qualified for adjustment of status (Respondent’s Brief at 11-12). As the Immigration Judge pointed out, the respondent did not show she would be eligible to adjust status (I.J. at 4). The respondent alleges that she is eligible to adjust status because pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 245.2(a)(5)(ii), an alien in removal proceedings who renews her application for adjustment of status does not accrue unlawful presence. However, the regulation also states that an applicant does not need to meet the requirement of section 245(c) of the Act at the time of renewal of the application as long as the requirements were met at the time the renewed application was initially filed with the director. The requirements of section 245(c) of the Act were not met at the time the most recent renewed application was filed with the Director of the USCIS on July 5, 2007. In particular, section 245(k) of the Act, i.e., the subsection that the respondent is seeking to adjust status under and which is referenced in section 245(c)(2) of the Act, directs that an alien seeking to adjust status cannot have been out of valid nonimmigrant status for more than 180 days. As the respondent had been out of valid nonimmigrant status for more than 180 days at the time she filed her renewed application for adjustment of status, she was not eligible for adjustment of status and the Immigration Judge was correct not to inform her that she was eligible for adjustment of status.
 
Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge denying the motion to reopen and the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
