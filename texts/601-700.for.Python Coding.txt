APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jessica Rodriguez Bell, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Bruce D. Imbacuan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals an Immigration Judge’s September 3, 2008, decision granting the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) motion to pretermit the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal and denying the respondent’s request to withdraw her pleadings to the Notice to Appear. We review the Immigration Judge’s factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The respondent’s fee waiver request is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). The case will be remanded.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by denying the respondent’s request to withdraw her pleadings. See Respondent’s Brief at 4-5. According to the respondent, the attorney who represented her before the Immigration Judge rendered ineffective assistance by filing an April 27, 2007, motion to change venue to the Cleveland Immigration Court in which the attorney admitted the factual allegations in the Notice to Appear and conceded that the respondent was removable for assisting an alien to enter the United States illegally. See section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act. According to the respondent, her prior attorney conceded removability without first consulting with the respondent. See Respondent’s Brief at 6; Motion to Change Venue. Moreover, the concession of removability left the respondent with no apparent means to avoid losing her permanent resident status, in that she was ineligible for cancellation of removal because, at the time of the service of the Notice to Appear, the respondent had not accrued 7 years of continuous residence in the United States. When the attorney realized that the respondent was not eligible for cancellation of removal, she attempted to withdraw the pleadings before the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 13).¿FN1º
 
Motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel are governed by our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). The respondent has not submitted an affidavit setting forth her agreement with former counsel, or filed a disciplinary complaint against former counsel. Nevertheless, we find substantial compliance with Lozada based on an affidavit from respondent’s former attorney.
 
*2 In this affidavit provided on appeal, the respondent’s prior attorney admitted that she conceded the respondent’s removability without first speaking to the respondent or discussing the factual allegations with the respondent. See Exh. 5 at 1. Further, given the egregiousness of the representation, we do not deem the attorney’s admission binding on the respondent. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986).
 
In sum, given the circumstances of this case, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen for ineffective assistance of counsel and remand this case for a hearing on the issue of the respondent’s removability and eligibility for relief from removal. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and the entry of a new decision.

At the hearing before the Immigration Judge, the respondent, through counsel, argued that “since we found out that we’re not eligible for cancellation of removal we’d like to now amend the pleadings and require that the state or the Government prove that the respondent is removable” (Tr. at 13).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Diana E. Moller, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Marci Ellsworth
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen her removal proceedings. In our decision dated November 18, 2009, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision which found her removable, granted her motion to suppress, but denied her motion to terminate. The present motion will be granted.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen (filed on February 19, 2010) is timely.¿FN1º The respondent alleges ineffective assistance of former counsel (Rosaura Del Carmen Rodriguez). In Matter of Compean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General directed the Board to continue to apply the previously established standards for reviewing motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel (pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
The respondent shows substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to allege ineffective assistance of former counsel. The respondent presents her declaration and Ms. Rodriguez’s declaration. The respondent has not filed a complaint with the appropriate bar authorities. The respondent explains that it would not be fair because of the pressure the Immigration Judge allegedly put on Ms. Rodriguez to plead to the allegations in the Notice to Appear (Form I-862) at the August 28, 2006, master calendar hearing (Motion at 12-13). Although we do not consider the respondent’s explanation to be satisfactory, we decline, under the circumstances present in this case, to find this to be fatal to the respondent’s claim.
 
The respondent shows prejudice. See Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893,898 (9th Cir. 2008) (prejudice is established when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings). The respondent hired Ms. Rodriguez to represent her (Motions Exhs. 1, 2). Ms. Rodriguez represented the respondent at her August 28, 2006, master calendar hearing and admitted the allegations in the Notice to Appear and conceded the charge of removability (Tr. at 3). The Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s motion to suppress but denied her motion to terminate. The only reason the Immigration Judge did not grant the respondent’s motion to terminate was because of Ms. Rodriguez’s admission of the allegations in the Notice to Appear and concession of removability (I.J. at 4-5; BIA at 2). We conclude that the respondent shows prejudice. Cf. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 383 (BIA 1986) (finding that the admissions and the concession of deportability were reasonable tactical actions undertaken by former counsel in order to enhance the alien’s chances of securing favorable action on the motion for change of venue and were properly held to be binding upon the alien).
 
*2 In summary, we grant the respondent’s motion to reopen because she shows substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, and shows prejudice. Because the respondent’s motion to reopen is timely filed, due diligence is not an issue.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Elizabeth C. Surin, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (both respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
The respondents appeal from the Immigration Judge’s September 9, 2008, decision. The Immigration Judge had previously, on April 21, 2008, granted the respondents pre-conclusion voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), the respondents having waived their right of appeal. The respondents thereafter, on August 18, 2008, filed a motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge denied the respondents’ untimely filed motion to reopen, concluding that the claim did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel during the course of the removal proceedings so as to support reopening. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondents are husband and wife. The respondents’ current counsel, in the motion filed with the Immigration Judge, requested reopening based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. It was noted in the motion that the previous counsel, after failing to timely file an appeal from a previous denial by the Department of Homeland Security (the DHS) of an employment-based visa petition (I-140), not only failed to advise the lead respondent that he could file a new Application for Employment Certification, but then further prejudiced the interests of the respondents by requesting voluntary departure. In response to the motion, the prior counsel stated that, early in December 2007, after the I-140 was denied, the employer pulled out, and no appeal was filed with DHS as, with no employer support, there was no ability to challenge the denial on appeal. The prior counsel noted that, as the respondents had no eligibility for relief, they were advised that voluntary departure was the only sensible option.
 
The Immigration Judge, after noting on several occasions that the first attorney representing the respondents did not seem entirely familiar with immigration law, concluded that the respondents did not receive ineffective assistance from their former attorney, finding that the interests of the respondents were not prejudiced during the course of the removal proceedings. The Immigration Judge found that the failure by the former attorney to request a continuance does not represent a failure to request a form of relief. The Immigration Judge further noted that she had indicated on the record that she was not willing to a grant a continuance unless there was evidence that a timely appeal of the I-140 denial had been filed, and, as there was no such evidence, this explains why no such motion was filed by the previous attorney. The Immigration Judge further found that nothing done in the Immigration Court prevents the respondents from filing for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i), even if they are not in the United States. The Immigration Judge, noting that she has no jurisdiction over an Application for Employment Certification, found that there is no evidence that, without an approved visa petition, the respondents were prima facie eligible for any relief other than voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge, after denying the motion to reopen, vacated the grant of pre-conclusion voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act.
 
*2 In the motion to reopen the respondents claim that previous counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to pursue such a claim, the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness; and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, to advance a successful claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate a due process violation, that is, prejudice, i.e., he “must show that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.” Uspango v. Ashcroft, 289 F.3d 226, 231 (3d Cir. 2002); see also Xu Yong Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 131 (3d Cir.2001). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998). The respondents have made no such showing. The respondents are clearly dissatisfied with former counsel’s representation because he failed in efforts to secure the approval of an employment based visa petition in proceedings before the DHS, but they have not shown that the hearing before the Immigration Judge was unfair or that, due to any alleged ineffective assistance of counsel during the course of the removal proceedings, they were prevented from reasonably presenting their case. See Balam-Chuc v. Mukasey, 547 F.3d 1044, 1050-51 (9th Cir. 2008).
 
The respondents’ principal allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel simply do not include any assertions of ineffective assistance of counsel during the course of these administrative proceedings before the Immigration Judge. Rather, the respondents’ arguments of ineffective assistance of counsel center on the lead respondent’s pursuit of his application for adjustment of status by way of an employment-based visa petition, difficulties over which we have no jurisdiction. The alleged ineffective assistance involved counsel who represented the respondents before the DHS, counsel who had been retained several years before these administrative proceeding were initiated by the issuance of the Notice to Appear in January 2008. It was only after the lead respondent’s application for adjustment of status by way of an employment-based visa petition was denied by the DHS, and no timely appeal was filed, that the respondents were left with limited options when they came before the Immigration Judge, albeit with the same counsel. If the respondents’ believe that, in pursuing a visa petition before the DHS, they are the victims of ineffective assistance of counsel, they must pursue this claim in a court of competent jurisdiction.
 
*3 The Immigration Judge weighed the evidence presented by the respondents and concluded that the factual assertions contained in the respondents’ motion were insufficient to reflect ineffective assistance on the part of former counsel during the course of the removal proceedings. The Immigration Judge’s factual determinations in this regard were not clearly erroneous within the meaning of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, North Carolina, 470 U.S. 564, 573-4 (1985) (holding that where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s choice between them cannot be deemed “clearly erroneous”). Furthermore, in light of the Immigration Judge’s factual determinations we find no reversible error in her legal conclusion that the respondent did not receive ineffective assistance from his former attorney during the course of the removal proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
Thus, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Claire H. Kim, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julia C. Contreras
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on December 21, 2004, when the Board affirmed, without opinion, an Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen her removal proceedings that were conducted in absentia on May 22, 2001. On August 4, 2010, the respondent, a native and citizen of Thailand, filed a motion requesting reopening. The motion will be denied.¿FN1º
 
With certain exceptions not pertinent here, the respondent is limited to one motion to reopen and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent’s motion to reopen is therefore barred by the time limitations applicable to motions.
 
However, even if considered timely, the respondent, who altogether failed to raise both her alleged lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel claims before both the Immigration Judge and the Board on appeal, has not sufficiently shown that such claims could not have been discovered or presented during the former proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Significantly, the respondent consistently and only asserted, before both the Immigration Judge and the Board, that she failed to attend her scheduled hearing because her “son became ill” (Resp. Brief on Appeal filed July 19, 2004; Resp. Brief dated March 30, 2004; Resp. Brief dated June 22, 2001). Further, the Immigration Judge noted that, even if the respondent’s motion was timely filed, no explanation for the delay was offered (I.J. at 1-2).
 
Under the circumstances, we do not find the respondent’s assertions, the alleged non receipt of the Notice to Appear and the ineffective assistance of her former counsel in connection with the untimely filings of both her motions before the Immigration Judge and the Board, alone sufficient to demonstrate patent error or prejudice. See, e.g., Joshi v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 732, 735 (7th Cir. 2004) (stating that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving, denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence”); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 58 (BIA 2006) (stating that a motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied). Nor has the respondent sufficiently complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
*2 Finally, we find no other reason for this Board’s further consideration of the respondent’s claim on our own motion pursuant to this Board’s sua sponte authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). On this record, the respondent has provided us with no reason to overlook her untimely motion. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

The respondent has been removed from the United States to Thailand. In Coyt v. Holder, 593 F.3d 902 (9th Cir. 2010), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Board may not find a motion withdrawn by operation of law, when the respondent is removed prior to the Board’s ruling on the motion. The motion is not, therefore, barred by reason of the respondent’s removal.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rhonda McCauley, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 On August 26, 2010, the respondent filed a “motion to reopen/reconsider sua sponte” the Board’s May 7, 2010, decision dismissing his appeal. He also seeks a stay of removal. The motion and stay request are denied.
 
Whether treated as a motion to reopen or one seeking reconsideration, the respondent’s motion is untimely. Sections 240(c)(6), (7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6), (7); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(b), (c)(2). Although the respondent avers that two unidentified attorneys provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not complied with any of the requirements for reopening on this basis. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent’s reference to Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010) is unavailing as he has provided no evidence that he has filed any collateral attack against his criminal conviction, nor shown that the same has been successful. To the extent that he avers error in his underlying criminal conviction, the Board cannot go behind a record of conviction to assess its validity. Matter of Roberts, 20 I&N Dec. 294, 301 (BIA 1991). Moreover, while he now seeks to pursue an application for asylum and related relief, he has not shown that such a claim could not have been presented at the time of the proceedings below. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
We recognize and appreciate the many letters written by friends and family in support of the respondent’s motion. However, the facts presented do not represent exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of our discretionary authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings.¿FN1º Therefore, the respondent’s request for a stay of removal is moot. The motion is denied.

Should the respondent satisfy the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance against former counsel and/or show that his conviction has been vacated pursuant to Padilla or another basis that supports reopening, he may seek sua sponte reopening before this Board. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Aroon Roy Padharia, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The motion is denied.¿FN1º The respondent, a native and citizen of Canada, has timely filed a motion requesting reconsideration of the Board’s June 11, 2010, decision dismissing the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable as an aggravated felon, as charged, and ineligible for adjustment of status. To the extent the respondent’s motion rests on previously raised issues related to (a) his removability as an aggravated felon based on the validity of his convictions, (b) whether his conviction for the offense of malicious wounding in violation of Virginia Code § 18.2-51, constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude thereby rendering him inadmissible and thus ineligible for adjustment of status, and (c) his eligibility for a section 212(h) waiver of inadmissibility, the respondent has not identified any issue that was not considered in the Board’s previous detailed decision, nor has he identified any error of fact or law in that decision which would alter the outcome. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). Similarly, the respondent has not identified any error in the Board’s decision to review the respondent’s appeal without a brief filed by the respondent’s attorney. As the Board previously concluded, the arguments contained in the Notice of Appeal were sufficient to enable meaningful appellate review (Board order dated June 11, 2010, at 2). To the extent the respondent claims ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with his counsel’s failure to file a brief on appeal, the respondent has not sufficiently shown patent error or complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.¿FN2º

IN RE: VICTOR MANUEL ROSARIO
File: AXXX XX8 483 - Orlando, FL
September 30, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Peter N. Macaluso, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(G)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(G)(ii)º - Marriage fraud - failed or refused to fulfill marital agreement
 
Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Removability
 
On August 26, 2008, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged. The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, now appeals. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s finding that he conceded the marriage fraud charge set forth in the Notice to Appear (Respondent’s Br. at 4-6). See section 237(a)(1)(G)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(G)(ii). He also asserts that his due process rights were violated because the Immigration Judge did not require the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to prove that charge¿FN1º (Respondent’s Br. at 4, 6). We review the factual findings in this case for clear error, and matters of law, judgment, and discretion under the de novo standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii) (2010).
 
The procedural history of this case raises significant concerns, particularly with respect to the Immigration Judge’s decision to sustain the marriage fraud charge. First, the Notice to Appear charges marriage fraud on the basis of entering into a marriage with a United States citizen for the purpose of procuring admission as an immigrant (Exh. 1). However, the notice only identifies a non-immigrant B2 visa admission, on October 6, 1998, as the respondent’s sole admission. The record indicates that the respondent married on August 26, 2006, but the notice does not indicate that the respondent adjusted his immigration status subsequent to his 1998 admission (Record of Sworn Statement of Leola Bernice Clark, dated August 7, 2007; Exh. 1).
 
Second, while the record contains a sworn statement of the United States citizen seeking to withdraw an I-130 visa petition because her marriage to the respondent was “fake,” the record does not contain an adjustment application or other document to indicate that the respondent sought an immigration benefit (Record of Sworn Statement of Leola Bernice Clark, dated August 7, 2007, at 1). Perhaps more importantly, section 237(a)(1)(G) of the Act pertains to aliens who “hav¿eº procured a visa or other documentation by fraud.” At most, the current record may indicate that the respondent sought to procure a visa or other documentation by fraud, but that does not suffice to sustain a charge under section 237(a)(1)(G).
 
*2 Third, after the respondent’s counsel conceded the charges set forth in the Notice to Appear, the respondent testified that he married his United States citizen wife because he loved her (Respondent’s Br. at 2, 4, 5; Tr. at 21, 27-28). The Immigration Judge told counsel that she should not have conceded the marriage fraud charge if the respondent planned to contest it (Tr. at 21, 29-30). Although the Immigration Judge gave the respondent and counsel an opportunity to discuss the matter, the Immigration Judge only asked for confirmation that the respondent had already conceded the charges, and not whether, in light of his testimony, he still wished to concede removability based on marriage fraud (Respondent’s Br. at 3, 5; Tr. at 32). The record does not indicate that the respondent recanted his testimony (Respondent’s Br. at 3).
 
Thus, we conclude that the record does not sufficiently support a finding that the respondent was removable on the grounds of marriage fraud. The Immigration Judge erred in sustaining the charge under section 237(a)(1)(G)(ii) on the basis of the record as it now exists. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii), 1240.10(c).
 
The respondent also asserts that he did not authorize his counsel to concede the marriage fraud charge, especially in light of his testimony that he married for love (Respondent’s Br. at 3). This assertion essentially raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Nevertheless, the potential ineffectiveness, combined with the above-described procedural deficiencies and the questionable nature of the marriage fraud count, lead us to conclude that a remand is warranted. Our remand does not preclude the DHS from endeavoring to prove the marriage fraud charge through the introduction of additional evidence into the record.
 
We also note that counsel withdrew the respondent’s request for voluntary departure when the Immigration Judge suggested that she would not grant it because the DHS opposed voluntary departure on the basis of the marriage fraud charge (Tr. at 30, 33). On remand, the respondent shall be given an opportunity to seek any relief for which he currently may be eligible, including voluntary departure.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
 
Board Member Roger A. Pauley respectfully dissents and would not find this a patent case of ineffective assistance of counsel so as to excuse the failure to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frank Murray, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jorge L. Pereira
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen her removal proceedings. In our decision dated April 8, 2010, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision which found her removable and determined that she was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents. The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen (filed on May 25, 2010) is timely. The respondent moves to reopen proceedings to apply for relief under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1995). The respondent alleges ineffective assistance of former counsel (Bryant Filomeno). In Matter of Compean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General directed the Board to continue to apply the previously established standards for reviewing motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel (pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). The respondent meets the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to allege ineffective assistance of former counsel. The respondent presents her affidavit, counsel’s letter to Mr. Filomeno, and a copy of the complaint filed against Mr. Filomeno.
 
The respondent shows prejudice. See generally Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 563 (BIA 2003) (finding that the alien had failed to show the requisite prejudice to warrant consideration of his late appeal). Mr. Filomeno filed an application for cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents on the respondent’s behalf, even though she was ineligible for such relief. See our April 8, 2010, decision. Mr. Filomeno did not file an application for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act on the respondent’s behalf, even though she appeared to be prima facie eligible to apply for such relief.
 
The respondent became a lawful permanent resident on September 29, 1989 (Exh. 1), so she had 7 years of lawful domicile in the United States as of September 29, 1996. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1212.3(f)(1) and (2) (2004) (section 212(c) applications shall be denied if the alien has not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence or the alien has not maintained lawful domicile in the United States for 7 years). The respondent pled nolo contendere to two counts of aggravated child abuse on July 17, 1995 (Exh. 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(h)(1) (even if an alien is in removal proceedings, an eligible alien may apply for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act, without regard to the AEDPA, with respect to a conviction if the alien pleaded guilty or nolo contendere and the alien’s plea agreement was made before April 24, 1996). The respondent was thus eligible to apply for section 212(c) relief. We will therefore grant the respondent’s motion to reopen and remand for further proceedings. Our remand order is limited to allowing the respondent to apply for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.¿FN1º

A request for humanitarian parole or deferred action arising from the recent devastating earthquake in Haiti and its aftermath are matters beyond the jurisdiction of the Board and the Immigration Judges. See Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734 (BIA 1988); Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348 (BIA 1982). However, a statement released by the Department of Homeland Security on January 13, 2010, reflects that “all removals to Haiti ¿have been haltedº for the time being in response to the devastation caused by ¿theº earthquake.” Further, the Secretary of Homeland Security has announced that Haitians who have continuously resided in the United States since January 12, 2010, and have been continuously physically present since January 21, 2010, may be granted Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”). See 75 Fed. Reg. 39,957-58 (July 13, 2010). Jurisdiction over applications for TPS by aliens under final orders of removal is with the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and TPS applications must be filed with the USCIS. See 8 C.F.R. § 1244.7. Please contact the Department of Homeland Security for any additional questions you may have regarding how to apply for TPS (1-800-375-5283 or www.uscis.gov).

IN RE: SANDRA MARIBEL SEGOVIA-SUPLIGUICHA
File: AXXX XX5 116 - New York, NY

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Albert Cohen, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert Bergida
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider the Board’s January 8, 2010, decision dismissing her appeal of an Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered deported on August 23, 1995. The respondent also seeks a stay of deportation. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion alleges that the Board erred as it affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision and “did not engage in substantial review” of that decision (Motion at 3). She asserts that the Board erroneously did not address the likelihood of success regarding her application for adjustment of status, and should have granted her motion as it was predicated on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, as both the Immigration Judge and this Board correctly noted, the respondent’s motion did not comply with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent does not contest this finding, which was fatal to her motion to reopen. As such, we find no error in the Board’s prior decision, and thus, reconsideration is not warranted. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b).
 
To the extent that the respondent seeks to introduce new evidence reflecting recent efforts to comply with the Lozada requirements, this aspect of her motion is one seeking reopening and rescission, and is untimely and number barred. Section 242B(c)(3) of the Act. However, if the respondent had demonstrated substantial compliance with Lozada, and shown due diligence in pursuing the claim, the time limit could arguably be equitably tolled. While we recognize her efforts in this regard, the respondent has not substantially complied with these requirements. Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005) (stating that an “alien who has failed to comply substantially with the Lozada requirements in her motion to reopen before the ¿Boardº forfeits her ineffective assistance of counsel claim in this Court”).
 
In her current, third untimely motion to reopen, the respondent now claims that she hired “Mr. Bosch” at “Function Inc.” in New York to represent her in “immigration proceedings” (Tab 3). The respondent asserts that she hired Mr. Bosch on the same day that she married her first husband, and he later helped her husband filed a visa petition on her behalf in September of that year (Tabs 3, 5). She avers that Mr. Bosch advised her to not attend her immigration hearing as he would “take care of this matter himself” (Tab 3). The respondent alleges that she at some unspecified time “later” learned she had been ordered deported in absentia. She also asserts she had contacted Mr. Bosch several times “during that period of time” and he claimed that her adjustment application was “in process.” The respondent alleges that when she “later” contacted Function Inc. she was told that Mr. Bosch had “disappeared.” She further asserts that she is uncertain whether he was an attorney.
 
*2 The respondent has not provided any evidence indicating that she has informed Mr. Bosch of the allegations against him, or filed a bar complaint with the appropriate authorities. While she claims that Functions Inc. stated that he had disappeared, she submitted nothing from this agency supporting this claim. The complaint filed with the “consumer complaint agency” does not satisfy the bar complaint requirement in Lozada as there is no evidence that it has any authority over members of the bar or persons who otherwise purport to provide immigration advice (Tab 4).¿FN1º Given her statement that she is uncertain whether Mr. Bosch is an attorney, no explanation has been offered as to whether she consulted the state bar authorities to ascertain his status, and why a complaint was not filed with bar authorities. The claims in her affidavit regarding the representational agreement she had with Mr. Bosch and her efforts to keep in touch with him are notable for their vagueness and generality.
 
As the Immigration Judge noted in denying her prior motion, the respondent received personal service of the charging document, which informed her of the time, date and location of her hearing, and of the consequences should she fail to appear (Exh. 1). She has not explained why she nonetheless took Mr. Bosch’s alleged advice to not appear despite those warnings. Given these various deficiencies, we find that the respondent has not substantially complied with the Lozada requirements, and her motion is not exempt from the applicable time limitation. See, e.g., Omar v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 647, 651 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding that the Board’s decision to deny the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim against a non-attorney immigration consultant based on non-compliance with Lozada was “neither arbitrary nor capricious”).
 
In addition, the respondent has not shown that she exercised the requisite due diligence in pursuing her claim. Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006) (“no matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled”); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir. 2000). This is further support for denial of reopening.
 
Finally, given this record, we do not find that the respondent has presented exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of our discretionary authority to sua sponte grant this untimely, number-barred motion to reopen. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
*3 As we find no basis for granting reconsideration of our January 8, 2010, decision, or reopening of proceedings, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN RE: PATRICK LEVILAIN

September 23, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sarah C. Schreck
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Termination; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Canada, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s November 5, 2009, decision finding him removable as charged and ordering him removed to Canada. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed an opposition brief. The appeal will be dismissed. While this matter was on appeal, the respondent filed what the Board construes to be a motion to remand. This motion will be denied.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of H-L-H- & Z-Y-Z-, 25 I&N Dec. 209, 211 (BIA 2010).
 
The respondent, a citizen and native of Canada, was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1967 (Exh. 1; I.J at 1). On February 14, 2007, in the Circuit Court of Marion County, State of Oregon, he pled guilty to the offense of burglary in the first degree, in violation of section 164.225 of the Oregon Revised Statutes, and he was sentenced to 19 months confinement (Exh. 2, Tab B at 1; I.J. at 1). In his decision, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was convicted of a theft or burglary offense for which a term of imprisonment of at least 1 year was imposed, thus constituting an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G).
 
The respondent argues that his criminal conviction was invalid because he received ineffective assistance from a prior criminal counsel, who allegedly failed to inform him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea (Respondent’s Notice of Appeal at 4). Although the respondent is apparently appealing a Circuit Court denial of post-conviction relief to the Supreme Court of the State of Oregon, to date the record does not reflect that the conviction has actually been overturned. Thus, his pending collateral attack on his conviction does not affect its finality for federal immigration purposes, or warrant a continuance. Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
In a letter associated with the record in April 2010, the respondent’s former immigration counsel appeared to reference Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 2010 WL 1222274 (March 31, 2010), in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that a lawyer representing an alien in connection with a guilty plea to a criminal offense has a constitutional duty to advise the alien about the risk of deportation arising from the conviction. However, any suggestion that the respondent’s conviction might be invalid in light of Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, does not change its finality for immigration purposes of such conviction, unless and until it is in fact overturned or materially amended. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996); Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent alleged that he was ill served by the failure of his prior immigration counsel to seek cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, and he requested a remand so that the Immigration Judge could consider this application in the first instance (Respondent’s Br. at 1-2, 9). We construe the respondent’s submissions in this regard as a motion to remand and reopen his proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4).
 
However, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. That is, he has not submitted an affidavit detailing the agreement he had with his prior counsel, asserted that the prior counsel had been informed of any allegations leveled against him and been given an opportunity to respond, or confirmed that disciplinary complaints had been filed against the prior counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). His actions to date could not even be construed as substantial compliance. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 825-26 (9th Cir. 2003) (recognizing substantial compliance with Lozada procedural requirements where legitimacy of the claim is plain on the face of the administrative record).
 
Finally, a motion to reopen will not be granted unless it establishes a prima facie case of statutory and discretionary eligibility for the underlying substantive relief sought. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Since the respondent’s aggravated felony conviction thus far remains intact, he has not shown that he is statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal. See section 240A(a)(3) of the Act. Therefore, he has not established that he was prejudiced by the apparent failure of his prior immigration counsel to file an application for cancellation of removal. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003); Ahmed v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 768, 772 (9th Cir. 2008).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

File: AXXX XX5 514 - Houston, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven T. Villarreal, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margaret R. Kugel
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on April 21, 2010, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s August 19, 2008, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. On May 28, 2010, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen with the Board based on the alleged ineffectiveness of her prior counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent’s timely motion to reopen now before us exceeds the numerical limitations for motions to reopen and will be denied. Under the law, with certain exceptions not pertinent here, a party is limited to one motion to reopen. Section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). However, as set out above, this is the respondent’s second motion to reopen as she previously filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (stating that a party may file only one motion to reopen “whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge ….”) (emphasis added). Consequently, the respondent’s motion to reopen is numerically barred.
 
We also reject the respondent’s contention that her motion to reopen should be granted based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Although the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has not squarely decided whether the number limit on motions to reopen can be equitably surmounted based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, it has found that the Board does not abuse its discretion in finding that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is insufficient where it fails to comply with requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000). As observed by DHS in this case, the affidavit submitted by the respondent does not set out the agreement and representations made by prior counsel and does not adequately explain why the respondent did not file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority (see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Exhibit 3).
 
In addition, the respondent has not shown, as required, that she suffered “substantial prejudice” as a result of the ineffective representation. See Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th 1994). Proving prejudice requires a prima facie showing that had the cancellation application been filed, she would have been entitled to relief. See id. However, as pointed out by the Immigration Judge in denying the respondent’s first motion to reopen, the respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal because she has not submitted evidence indicating that a qualifying relative would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship upon her removal to Mexico. Consequently, even assuming arguendo the availability of equitable relief for a number-barred motion to reopen, we do not find that it is warranted. Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion for a stay is denied.

IN RE: MOSES MACHARIA GICHUHI
File: AXXX XX2 604 - Baltimore, MD

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stuart J. Snyder, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carrie E. Johnston
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Kenya, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on June 3, 2009, after failing to appear at a hearing on that date. He filed a motion to reopen on July 22, 2009. The Immigration Judge denied it on September 25, 2009, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be sustained.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). We decide this appeal de novo.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that “exceptional circumstances” prevented his appearance at the hearing. We consider the totality of the evidence in evaluating this issue. See Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33 (BIA 1998) and Matter of B-A-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 1998). See also generally Kaweesa v. Gonzales, 450 F.3d 62, 68-69 (1st Cir. 2006) (including the strength of the alien’s underlying claim); Romero-Morales v. INS, 25 F.3d 125, 129-31 (2d Cir. 1994); Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, 298 F.3d 888 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
Here, we consider that the record contains a statement from the respondent’s former attorney. Therein, counsel admits that she erroneously instructed the respondent to appear for his hearing on June 9, 2009, rather than the correct date of June 3, 2009. The respondent’s declaration corroborates his attorney’s account. In addition, we consider that the respondent filed his motion to reopen almost immediately after learning that he was ordered removed from the United States in absentia. His due diligence in this matter is strong evidence of the respondent’s lack of intention to miss his hearing. We also consider that the respondent appeared at numerous previous hearings since 2007. Further, a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel is present and the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See generally Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). It appears that the respondent’s failure to appear at his hearing was caused by an errant instruction from his former counsel.
 
*2 We find based on the totality of the evidence that the respondent has established that reopening of these proceedings based on “exceptional circumstances” is appropriate. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and these proceedings are reopened and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on July 24, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision finding that he did not derive citizenship through his mother or through his United States citizen stepfather, who adopted him in 1950. Our decision left in place a previous Immigration Judge decision finding the respondent removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and ordering his removal from the United States. The respondent’s petition to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, seeking review of our July 2006 decision, was dismissed.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of South Korea. He has timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s July 17, 2009, decision rejecting his motion to reopen because the Immigration Court lacked jurisdiction to consider this motion, as the Board last dismissed his appeal in July 2006. The respondent also has filed a motion to reopen with this Board, arguing that proceedings should be reopened to allow him to pursue adjustment of status though the approved visa petition filed on his behalf by his United States citizen wife. The appeal is dismissed and the motion to reopen is denied.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s factual determinations, including credibility determinations, for clear error. See United States v. National Assn. of Real Estate Boards, 339 U.S. 485, 495 (1950) (a factual finding is not “clearly erroneous” merely because there are two permissible views of the evidence). The Board reviews de novo questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We first note that we find no cause to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision that she had no jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s May 11, 2009, motion to reopen. Because the respondent had appealed the Immigration Judge’s last decision of record, jurisdiction over any subsequent motions would rest with the Board, and not the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2, 1003.23(b)(1).
 
*2 Turning to the motion to remand, the respondent claims that reopening is appropriate to assess his eligibility for “newly-acquired relief” in the form of an application for adjustment of status based on an approved visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife. See Respondent’s Brief and Motion at 6. Because the respondent’s motion was filed with the Board on September 8, 2009, it is untimely, as it was filed some 3 years after our last decision in this case, which was issued in July 2006. Generally, a motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision was rendered. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent argues that the time period for filing the motion should be tolled because his prior counsel provided ineffective assistance in (1) pursuing the argument that removal proceedings should be terminated because the respondent had derived United States citizenship through his parents, (2) failing to pursue below a challenge to the validity of the respondent’s convictions, and (3) failing to pursue below a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act. See Respondent’s Brief and Motion at 7-8.
 
While the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, under whose jurisdiction this case arises, recognizes equitable tolling of motions deadlines in ineffective assistance of counsel cases, an alien must demonstrate not only that his constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). Moreover, an alien must demonstrate substantial compliance with the general procedural requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (requiring the alien to lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative, to give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and to file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made).
 
The respondent has not shown due diligence or any attempt to comply with the Matter of Lozada requirements. In fact, the respondent entirely omits any explanation for the 3-year delay in filing a motion to reopen and claims to be exempt from meeting the Lozada requirements because the ineffective assistance of former counsel was “clear on the record.” See Respondent’s Brief and Motion at 8. As to the latter claim, we find former counsel’s decision to pursue a derivative citizenship claim—as opposed to a direct or an indirect attack on the criminal convictions and resulting grounds of removability—to be distinct from what would constitute “ineffective assistance of counsel.” Indeed, counsel’s strategic decision in this regard is not the type of conduct typically held to be “ineffective assistance.” See Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113, 127 n. 7 (BIA 1998) (citing Thorsteinsson v. INS, 724 F.2d 1365 (9th Cir. 1984)) (ineffective assistance counsel claim rejected where attorney made informed, strategic decision). In any event, such a decision would not constitute “clear” ineffective assistance obviating the need to make some attempt to comply with the Matter of Lozada, supra, requirements.
 
*3 As to due diligence, as noted above, the respondent’s motion is silent on this point. He offers no event that triggered his discovery of the alleged ineffective assistance of past counsel and does not describe his actions over the course of the 3 years that lapsed between the Board’s July 2006 decision and his first attempt to reopen proceedings before the Immigration Judge in May 2009. We note for the record that the respondent indicated that the visa petition filed by his wife was approved in August 2007. Yet since that time, the record does not reflect that the respondent did anything to pursue reopening of proceedings. In the absence of any evidence that he diligently tried to discover ineffective assistance of counsel or that he actually received any ineffective attorney advice, we decline to find that the deadline for timely filing a motion to reopen should be equitably tolled. Iturribarria v. INS, supra.
 
Finally, we note that the respondent’s motion lacks a showing of prejudice, even if we were to find that ineffective assistance of counsel occurred and that tolling was warranted because of the respondent’s diligence. That is, the respondent suffered three serious convictions, i.e., first-degree robbery, possession of a prohibited firearm, and theft. See Immigration Judge’s April 13, 2006, Order. The respondent has not shown that he is admissible to the United States, in light of these convictions, which raise the possibility that he has suffered one or more crimes involving moral turpitude. If so, his ability to secure a waiver of inadmissibility as to those convictions is doubtful, since (1) the robbery and weapons convictions were pursuant to a jury verdict, rendering him ineligible for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act, and (2) he has been found removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, rendering him ineligible for relief under section 212(h) of the Act.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michaelangelo Rosario, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 15, 2009. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on November 6, 2008. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
We find that proper notice was provided to the respondent. The record reflects that the Immigration Judge reopened proceedings on a prior occasion after the respondent failed to appear. Following the Immigration Judge’s decision reopening the respondent’s case, a hearing notice scheduling the respondent’s case was mailed to the respondent’s attorney of record, Pablo Cabrera, Esquire. We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent received proper notice inasmuch as written notice of his hearing was provided to his attorney of record. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (finding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (providing that whenever a person is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to the attorney or representative of record, or to the person himself if unrepresented). On the Notice of Appeal, the respondent does not contest the Immigration Judge’s determination that notice was provided to the respondent’s former counsel.
 
To the extent that the respondent argues exceptional circumstances because his attorney did not tell him the date of his hearing after it had been reopened by the Immigration Judge, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is untimely as it was not filed within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Moreover, he has not satisfied any of the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A. G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”). See generally Vaz Dos Reis v. Holder, 606 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2010) (stating that with respect to motions to reopen in absentia proceedings courts typically treat ineffective assistance of counsel claims as an exceptional circumstance). In sum, we find no reason to disturb the decision of the Immigration Judge.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: EDNA HUNTE-DIAZ
File: AXXX XX5 010 - Los Angeles, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anwer Khan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of Guatemala, was ordered removed from the United States on February 26, 2009. Her appeal of that decision will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). We decide this appeal de novo.
 
The respondent argues in her Notice of Appeal that she was denied consideration for any form of relief from removal on account of the ineffective assistance of her former counsel. She states that she is eligible to be considered for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b. The respondent infers that the Immigration Judge would have considered or even granted her cancellation of removal had it not been for her former attorney’s negligence by not adequately preparing and filing her application. She requests a remand for a hearing.
 
The Board will not grant a request for a remand based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel unless the respondent first establishes certain requirements. In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. See also Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
In the instant case, the respondent has not submitted an affidavit or filed a complaint with the bar association against her former attorney. She has also not provided her former attorney with an opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. Based upon this lack of proof, we are unable to find that the respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements for proving that she was ineffectively represented by her former attorney in these proceedings. We will therefore not remand the record based on this particular allegation.
 
*2 The respondent further vaguely asserts in her Notice of Appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her motion to continue her February 26, 2009, hearing to complete her application for cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge noted that she had earlier continued the proceeding for that purpose from February 14, 2008, to February 26, 2009. We find for the reasons stated by the Immigration Judge that the decision denying the respondent’s motion to continue was correct. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul C. Agu, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jorge Ramos
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals the January 28, 2009, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact by an Immigration Judge under the clearly erroneous standard of review, but we may review de novo questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii) (2008); see also Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The record reflects that the respondent was granted voluntary departure on September 22, 2008, with an alternate order of removal. On January 16, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen seeking to adjust his status through his United States citizen spouse. The Immigration Judge correctly denied the motion as untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
In his motion, the respondent alluded to ineffective assistance of counsel by his former counsel. However, the respondent failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In that case, we held that ineffective assistance of counsel claims require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned is informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, where this case arises, has found the application of the noted requirements to be a necessary condition to obtain a reopening of removal proceeding on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Belte-Veloz v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 2008). Here, the respondent has failed to fulfill any of the above-noted requirements. Nor has the respondent specified how he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s representation. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 562 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent maintains that the Immigration Judge should have reopened his proceedings sua sponte. We find that the respondent’s motion does not establish an exceptional situation sufficient to warrant reopening of his removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered:

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ishrat Sami, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision issued March 11, 2010. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen because he had established good cause for a continuance of her hearing. The respondent contends that his attorney was required to attend another court hearing at the same time. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We find that the Immigration Judge’s decision to proceed with the hearing on December 9, 2009, was appropriate under the circumstances. The regulations provide that an Immigration Judge has the discretion to grant a request for continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. However, parties are obligated to appear for a scheduled hearing unless and until the Immigration Judge expressly grants a request for a continuance. See Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988). Since the Immigration Judge did not rule on the respondent’s request for a continuance, the respondent was required to appear for his hearing. See Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996) (the filing of a motion for a continuance does not excuse an alien from failing to appear). The Immigration Judge was within her bounds to conduct proceedings in absentia.
 
Finally, we note that the respondent has not made a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F. 2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent has not established any other exceptional circumstance for his failure to appear. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

File: AXXX XX9 796 - Honolulu, HI
August 26, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Manuel Q. Diones, Esquire
*1 After the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Board, we returned the case to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings on July 31, 2009. The Board on May 24, 2010, affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision, in which the judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings, which were conducted in absentia. The respondent, who is from El Salvador, filed a motion with the Board on August 16, 2010. The motion, to which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded, will be denied.
 
The Board first considers that the respondent was removed from the United States on August 16, 2010, the same day that the motion was filed. The Ninth Circuit has held that 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) cannot be applied to cause the withdrawal of a motion filed by an alien who has been forcibly removed while the motion is pending before the Board. Coyt v. Holder, 593 F.3d 902, 907 (9th Cir. 2010). As the respondent was removed the same day that the motion was filed, the Board will assume that it retains jurisdiction over the motion, despite the respondent’s removal.
 
In the May 24, 2010, decision, we fully considered the record before determining that the respondent received adequate notice of his removal hearing, where he failed to notify the Immigration Court as to his most current mailing address. Section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(B). The Board also rejected the respondent’s claim that “exceptional circumstances” excused his failure to appear at the removal hearing. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act. Although the respondent contended that an attorney, Ronald Oldenburg, had in his possession the respondent’s address, “¿tºhe respondent … indicates his belief that he has not been a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and a claim alleging such has not been submitted to the Board.” Board’s May 24, 2010, dec., at 2. Moreover, the record did not contain an affidavit from either the respondent or Oldenburg.
 
The pending motion, in part, reargues the respondent’s contention that the Board should have sustained his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny reopening of the in absentia proceedings in this case. As such, the motion is an untimely motion to reconsider, as a motion to reconsider must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the challenged order. Section 240(c)(6) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b).
 
To the extent that the pending motion may be considered a motion to reopen, it was timely filed. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). However, a motion to reopen imposes a heavy burden on the moving party to show that reopening is warranted. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Here, the motion merely presents an affidavit from the respondent’s girlfriend, stating that she has “instituted an investigation ¿with the Hawaii Office of Disciplinary Counselº with regards to Mr. Oldenburg’s ineffective assistance of counsel leading to ¿the respondent’sº absence from his November 2, 2009, heating.” Kalio Affidavit, at § 6; Respondent’s Mot., at 5, 7-8. The affidavit does not assert that the attorney was ineffective, nor does it explain how the attorney may be responsible for the respondent missing the removal hearing. Moreover, the affidavit does not come from the respondent himself. The girlfriend’s affidavit is insufficient to properly raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against Oldenburg. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent’s pending motion will, therefore, be denied.
 
ORDER: The pending motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Turkey, moves pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen proceedings and to reissue our last decision, dated May 19, 2009. In that decision, we denied a motion to reopen as untimely. On May 22, 2008, we issued our final order in this matter, dismissing the appeal of the Immigration Judge’s January 16, 2008, decision denying a waiver under section 209(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1159(c), and also denying withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act and the Convention Against Torture. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16-18.¿FN1º On July 31, 2008, we denied a motion to reconsider. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). In removal proceedings, motions to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The present motion, filed on April 14, 2010, is untimely as it was not filed within 90 days of our May 22, 2008, final order. 8 C.F.R. § 1002.3(c). However, the respondent argues that this is due to the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). The motion will be denied.
 
The time limit on motions to reopen may be equitably tolled where the alien establishes that the respondent exercised due diligence to discover or act upon the alleged incompetence of her prior attorney in a timely manner. 8 C.F.R. §1003.2(c); Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127 (2nd Cir. 2008); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3rd 167 (2d Cir. 2006); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000). In addition, the motion must establish that the ineffective assistance caused the respondent substantial prejudice amounting to a due process violation that would warrant a tolling of the time limit in.. See Id; Romero v. INS, 399 F.3d 109, 112 (2nd Cir. 2005), citing U.S. v. Perez, 330 F.3d 97, 101 (2nd Cir. 2001); Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 The respondent argues essentially that her prior counsel, Attorney Edwin T. Gania, failed to timely file a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit of our May 19, 2009, decision denying the first motion to reopen. Attorney Gania filed petitions for review of our May 22, 2008, merits decision, and of our July 31, 2008, decision denying the motion to reconsider, which were consolidated before the Second Circuit. These petitions were denied. Yalincak v. Holder, 352 Fed.Appx. 584, 2009 WL 3739067 (C.A. 2 November 10, 2009) (unpublished) (petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc denied and mandate issued on May 21, 2010). The respondent claims that she paid Attorney Gania to file a petition for review of our May 19, 2009, decision and he failed to do so, and therefore the decision should be reissued to allow the filing of a timely petition for review.
 
The respondent also argues that Attorney Gania was ineffective by failing to file a full and accurate copy of the “Joint Appendix” (a.k.a. “Joint Appendix”) with the Second Circuit (Motion to Reopen and Motion to Reissue Pursuant to Lozada (“Motion”) at 2, 6). The respondent also argues that there is new factual evidence warranting reopening in discretion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
Regarding the first argument, that the Attorney Gania failed to file a petition for review of our May 19, 2009, decision, the motion proffers, inter alia, a February 11, 2010, letter from Attorney Gania to the respondent (Motion at Exh. 3). In the letter, the attorney admitted that he did not file a petition for review of the May 19, 2009, decision, and offered the respondent a settlement. Attorney Gania offered to waive further payment for the Petition for Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc that was pending at the Second Circuit, and to refund the money paid for the motion to reopen. Alternatively, if the respondent decided to pursue a grievance or bar complaint against the attorney’s office, the attorney would be forced to withdraw from the Second Circuit proceeding because of a conflict of interest.
 
The respondent apparently did not file a bar complaint as no evidence of a bar complaint has been proffered. Also, the Petition for Panel Rehearing and Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc (“Petition for Rehearing”) filed at the Second Circuit on February 23, 2010, indicates Attorney Gania still represents the respondent in front of the Second Circuit (Motion at Exh. 8). See also Yalincak v. Holder, supra. Therefore, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, supra. Furthermore, the respondent’s continued retention of the attorney is antithetical to the claim that the attorney provided ineffective assistance. Moreover, as discussed below, no prejudice from any alleged ineffective assistance of counsel has been shown.
 
*3 Regarding the claim that counsel failed to provide a complete copy of the “Joint Appendix” with the Second Circuit, the respondent’s Petition for Rehearing filed with the Second Circuit places the blame for this on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (see Motion at Exh. 8 Petition for Rehearing at 4-5). No ineffective assistance of counsel has been argued on this, or any other matter, before the Second Circuit, which belies the respondent’s claim before the Board that she believes Attorney Gania provided ineffective assistance before the Second Circuit, or the Board. The motion does not include arguments that could not have been raised in a timely motion to reopen or in a petition before the Second Circuit that may have warranted a different outcome in the matter. Therefore, the motion does not establish the substantial prejudice amounting to a due process violation that would warrant a tolling of the time limit in these proceedings. See Id; Romero v. INS, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra. The motion thus does not establish an exception to the time limitation on motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
Finally, the instant motion sets forth discretionary factors for consideration. These include the fact that the respondent’s husband and daughter recently became lawful permanent residents, and that the respondent and her husband are facing health issues (Motion at 16-21). However, there is no objective documentation of the medical or other discretionary factors. Notwithstanding, in consideration of all the factors involved in this matter, this case does not demonstrate an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretion to reopen these proceedings or reissue the final decision under our sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997)(stating that “¿tºhe power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen proceedings and to reissue our May 19, 2009, decision is denied.

As noted in our final decision, after having been admitted as a visitor in 1992, in 1996 the respondent was previously placed in deportation proceedings for having overstayed her visa, and also because of a September 22, 1995, conviction for practicing medicine without a license in violation of section 25-22.5-8-1 of the Indiana Code, for which she was sentenced to 8 years in prison, with 4 years suspended. On April 4, 1998, she had been granted asylum (I.J. at 3, 6; Exhs. 1, 2). The respondent was placed in these removal proceedings because of a March 19, 2007, conviction for conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, to commit wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343, for which she was sentenced to 24 months prison, 36 months supervised release, and $2,250,000 in restitution (I.J. at 10-12; Exhs. 1-4). The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was subject to removal as an aggravated felon for conspiracy to commit fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim exceeded $10,000, as defined in sections 101(a)(43)(M) and (U) of the Act (I.J. at 11-12; Exhs. 1-4). Section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Louis Leeder, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 18, 2009, denying his motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on January 19, 2000. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Upon de novo review, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision for the reasons stated therein. In reaching this conclusion we note that the respondent’s assertion that he received inaccurate advice from an “agency” and an unidentified attorney which scared him to the point he decided not to go to his hearing on January 19, 2000, is not an exceptional circumstance to excuse his failure to appear. See section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1); 8 U.S.C. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Although the respondent has essentially alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the unidentified attorney, he has failed to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Moreover, he has claimed that he married a United States citizen and that she has filed an I-130 visa petition on his behalf. However, he failed to present evidence that the I-130 had been filed and approved or otherwise establish that he is eligible for adjustment of status. Consequently, we find no basis to disturb the Immigration Judge’s determination.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Richard Jurgens
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order in this case on August 29, 2008. This case was last before the Board on May 25, 2010, however, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and reconsider for having been filed out of time. In that decision, we found that the respondent had not properly set forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, or otherwise offered arguments or evidence of any exceptional situation to persuade us to reconsider our prior order sua sponte or to reopen the proceedings on our own motion under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). On June 23, 2010, the respondent filed the instant motion. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
Although the motion is titled “Motion for Reconsideration”, the respondent has not contested the bases of our decision denying his previous motion. See generally Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (holding that a motion to reconsider a decision of the Board must include, inter alia, an allegation of material factual or legal errors in the prior decision that is supported by pertinent authority). Instead, the respondent has submitted new evidence, including evidence that since our prior order he has attempted to comply with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We find, therefore, that the instant motion is in the nature of a motion to reopen. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). As a motion to reopen, the motion is untimely and number-barred. See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). We do not find that any of the general exceptions to the filing restrictions apply to the respondent’s motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). Moreover, for the reasons below, we do not find that the exercise of our sua sponte authority is warranted in this case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
In our decision dismissing the appeal, we found no legal error in the Immigration Judge’s decision pretermitting the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(c), because the 1989 conviction underlying the charges of removability was by jury trial. See I.N.S. v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (U.S. 2001); Alexandre v. United States Attorney General, 452 F.3d 1204 (11th Cir. 2006). The respondent now appears to blame his former counsel for his inability to apply for the section 212(c) waiver. Specifically, he asserts that his former counsel failed to inform him of the immigration consequences of his criminal convictions when she conceded removability on his behalf. See Respondent’s Motion at 9.
 
*2 It was due to the respondent’s criminal convictions, rather than to any action on the part of his former counsel in these proceedings, that the respondent was placed in these removal proceedings. The respondent has not contested the fact that he was convicted by a jury trial rather than by a plea of guilty. Cf Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (U.S. 2010) (holding that counsel engaged in deficient performance by failing to advise the defendant that his plea of guilty made him subject to automatic deportation). Nor is there any evidence offered in support of this motion to indicate that an attack on the respondent’s convictions has resulted in a vacatur. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (BIA 1996). We find, therefore, that the respondent has failed to establish that his former counsel committed any error resulting in prejudice to the respondent when she conceded removability on his behalf. See Dakane v. United States Attorney General, 371 F.3d 771 (11th Cir. 2004). In sum, we reject the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and we conclude that reopening sua sponte is not warranted in this case. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely, number-barred motion to reopen will be denied.¿FN1º

File: AXXX XX3 853 - New York, NY
August 5, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On April 22, 2010, the respondent, a native and citizen of Guyana, filed a timely motion to reopen these removal proceedings to afford him the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status and a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c).
 
In our prior order we agreed with the Immigration Judge that it was futile for the respondent to apply for a 212(c) waiver because it could not waive the respondent’s 2005 conviction for the unlawful possession of more than 30 grams of marijuana.
 
The respondent now argues that his accredited representative erred in admitting that he was convicted of the offense of unlawful possession of marijuana in 2005 and conceding that he was removable under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation (Exhs. 4, 9 and 13; Tr. at 72-73). He claims that his accredited representative should not have introduced the lab report which reflected that the respondent was in possession of 3.8 ounces of marijuana. See Respondent’s Motion at 3. The respondent asserts that he was prejudiced when the lab report, which does not constitute a record of conviction, was submitted to the Immigration Court. In short, the respondent asserts that the Department of Homeland Security was only able to establish that he was convicted of possessing more than 30 grams of marijuana and that he is removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act - because of the actions of his representative. The respondent has complied with the requirements for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009).
 
Essentially, the respondent seeks to withdraw the admission and concession entered by his accredited representative. See Respondent’s Motion, Attachment C. We have long held that absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made before, during, or even after a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity binds his client as a judicial admission; and that there is a strong presumption that such a decision is a reasonable tactical decision. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). Notably, the respondent does not claim that the pleading is factually untrue or incorrect. Given the facts and circumstances of this case, we find that the respondent is bound by the admissions and concessions he made by and through his representative.
 
*2 Additionally, the respondent’s marijuana conviction would have rendered him inadmissible pursuant to section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), and, thus, ineligible for adjustment of status. See section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). Even if the lab report had not been submitted, he would be ineligible for a corresponding waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), because he is a lawful permanent resident who has been convicted of an aggravated felony.
 
Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992) (motion to reopen may be denied based upon the failure to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought).
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Senior Attorney
 
CHARGE:

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
Considering the intervening events in this case since it was last before the Immigration Judge, the respondent’s motion to reopen her removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge will be granted and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge to provide her the opportunity to pursue an application for adjustment of status. In this regard, we note that the respondent has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for advancing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; the immediate relative visa petition filed on her behalf by her United States citizen husband has been approved; and, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) now states that it does not oppose the respondent’s motion to remand her proceedings to the Immigration Court noting that she appears statutorily eligible to adjust her status. Accordingly, the appeal from the denial of her motion to reopen is sustained and these proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings not in consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher J. Stender, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Victoria Levin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on August 5, 1992, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s March 16, 1992, decision finding the respondent statutorily ineligible for voluntary departure and ordering him deported as charged to Mexico.
 
On April 29, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reopen these proceedings premised, in part, on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion is untimely filed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not relevant here, a motion to reopen “must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which a final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is earlier”).
 
However, because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether this case warrants equitable tolling of the time limits on motions to reopen. The Ninth Circuit has held that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
The respondent has failed to provide an explanation of his efforts to pursue his case since he was issued a final deportation order in 1992. Therefore, we find equitable tolling of the 90-day deadline is unwarranted. In addition, the respondent has not complied with the requirements for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009).
 
Furthermore, the respondent has failed to show prejudice resulting from his attorney’s actions. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra; Ahmed v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 768, 772 (9th Cir. 2008) (“prejudice results when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. The petitioner does not need to show that she would win on her claims absent her attorneys’ deficient performance. She need only show plausible grounds for relief” (citations omitted)). The respondent is correct that section 249 of the Act does not require that the registry applicant be a person of good moral character for a specified period of time. See generally Matter of Sanchez-Linn, 20 I&N Dec. 362 (BIA 1991). However, we need not determine whether the respondent could have established good moral character for registry purposes, because he was otherwise ineligible for registry at the time of his 1992 deportation hearing. To be eligible for registry, the applicant must be admissible pursuant to section 212(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a). See section 249 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1259. The respondent was inadmissible under section 212(a)(2) of the Act due to his 1989 drug-related conviction.¿FN1º Accordingly, he has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by his attorney’s conduct. Based on the foregoing, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
*2 The respondent’s request for a stay is denied. The Board entertains stays only when an appeal, a motion to reopen, or a motion to reconsider is pending before the Board. In the instant case, the respondent does not have an appeal or a motion pending before us. See 8 C.F.R. §1003.6.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s motion is denied. This case was last before the Board on November 17, 2009, when the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable as charged and denying the respondent’s request for a continuance. On January 19, 2010, the respondent filed a motion requesting reconsideration and stay of removal. The respondent’s motion is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Furthermore, the respondent, who has presented no evidence demonstrating either that his first visa petition was improperly denied¿FN1º or that his second visa petition, which was filed on his behalf by the same spouse/petitioner who filed the first denied petition, has not identified any error of fact or law in the Board’s previous decision that would alter the outcome. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). See also Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 792 (BIA 2009) (recognizing no abuse of discretion in the denial of a continuance for adjudication of a second visa petition when the first I-130 filed by the same petitioner was denied) (citations omitted). Moreover, we do not find the respondent’s mere disagreement with or disapproval of the outcome of the Board’s previous detailed decision sufficient to demonstrate either that the Board improperly evaluated or disregarded the facts and evidence presented or legal error.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brian I. Kaplan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated June 4, 2008, denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded.
 
We review findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, under a clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent seeks reopening on the grounds that his prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance. To warrant reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must comply with the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and demonstrate that he was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance.
 
The respondent raised his ineffective assistance of counsel claim with the Immigration Judge but the Immigration Judge did not address it. Inasmuch as we do not make findings of fact in the course of deciding appeals, we will remand the record for such findings of fact and legal conclusions. See generally Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). Accordingly, we will grant the respondent’s appeal and the record will be remanded.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kenneth Byrd, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on December 17, 2009, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal that was entered against her on November 16, 1999. The respondent now files another motion to reopen, claiming that she received ineffective assistance of counsel from the prior attorney who filed her first motion to reopen and urging that her proceedings should be reopened. The Department &Homeland Security has not responded to the current motion.
 
Even assuming the time limits do not apply to the present motion to reopen, because she still seeks reopening based on a claim of lack of proper notice, the motion is number-barred. Section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A) (providing that an alien may filed only one motion to reopen removal proceedings); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (only one motion to reopen may be filed regarding an order of removal entered in absentia); see also Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000).
 
Although the respondent does not make her argument clear, it appears she wishes the motions number limit to be equitably tolled because she received ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to the filing of her first motion to reopen. Habchy v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 858, 864-65 (8th Cir. 2006) (discussing other circuits’ recognition of the “sparingly invoked” doctrine of equitable tolling for ineffective assistance of counsel claims). Specifically, she contends that his failure to include an affidavit or other evidence caused her motion to be denied.
 
We first find that the respondent has failed to meet any of the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), such that she has properly raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. More importantly, she has not shown that equitable tolling is warranted in this case because she has not shown that she was prejudiced. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had signed the certified mail receipt showing she received the Notice to Appear (NTA), and she has never claimed that she did not sign that receipt. Rather, her argument on appeal was that the certified mail receipt might have pertained to some other document, not that she did not sign it. In our decision, we specifically found that the certified mail receipt related to the NTA. Thus, it does not appear that an affidavit would have any impact on the finding that the respondent was properly served with the NTA in this case and had notice of the removal proceedings against her. Nor has she identified any other evidence that counsel should have submitted that would have refuted this finding. She thus has not shown any failure on prior counsel’s part that prejudiced her, such that equitable tolling of the motions number limit would be warranted. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Daniel Perez-Garcia, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Wm. Tracy Hamby
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 1, 2009, which ordered him removed from the United States. The parties have provided arguments on appeal. On appeal, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion denied.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but we review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). In this case, the record shows that the Immigration Judge set a deadline of March 31, 2009, for the filing of any and all applications for relief and advised the respondent of the consequences for the failure to file applications by the deadline (Tr. at 14, 16). However, no application was filed. Based on the undisputed facts, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deem the applications for relief abandoned. Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c).
 
The respondent seeks to reopen proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel and to remand the record so that he may pursue applications for cancellation of removal and withholding of removal. However, the motion does not establish compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Specifically, although the motion indicates that the respondent filed a grievance against prior counsel, the motion is not accompanied by evidence to that effect. In addition, inasmuch as the motion does not include an application for either form of relief or any supporting documentation, the respondent cannot establish that prior counsel’s failure to timely file a claim for such relief resulted in substantial prejudice. Bolvito v. Mukasey, 527 F.3d 428, 438 (5th Cir. 2008). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hena Mansori, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joseph M. Yeung
Senior Attorney
*1 The respondent, who is from Jordan, filed a timely motion to reopen on January 27, 2010, after the Board dismissed his appeal on October 29, 2009. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) opposes the pending motion, which will be granted.
 
An Immigration Judge on November 4, 2008, issued a removal order concerning the respondent. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act, as failing to show the requisite hardship to a qualifying relative. The Immigration Judge also declined to further continue proceedings. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent failed to show that he was prima facie eligible for adjustment of status, not having submitted an application for relief or supporting documents (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 36). Rather, the adjustment application had been filed by the respondent with the DHS (Tr. at 32).
 
The respondent seeks to have proceedings reopened in order to pursue an application for adjustment of status. See section 245 of the Act. The respondent’s wife was adjusted to lawful permanent resident status on February 27, 2008 (Respondent’s Mot., at Exh. G). This resulted after a visa petition filed by the respondent’s wife’s brother, which was approved on April 4, 1997, became current (Respondent’s Mot., at Exh. F). The respondent argues that he is eligible for adjustment of status as a derivative beneficiary to the visa approved on behalf of his wife.
 
The respondent claims that his prior counsel, Raul Villasuso, Jr., was ineffective, because counsel failed to pursue an application for adjustment of status with the Immigration Judge, or inform him that the application had to be filed with the Immigration Court, rather than with the DHS (Respondent’s Mot., at 8-11).
 
Contrary to the argument of the DHS, the Board finds that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Former counsel disputes the respondent’s charges, although he does not explain why he argued, on appeal to the Board, that the Immigration Judge should have allowed the respondent to pursue his adjustment application before the DHS. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(1)(i)(“In the case of any alien who has been placed … in removal proceedings ¿other than as an arriving alienº, the Immigration Judge hearing the proceeding has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any application for adjustment of status the alien may file”).
 
*2 The respondent also contends that former counsel did not inform him of the Board’s October 29, 2009, decision until January 7, 2010, and therefore his failure to depart under the Board’s voluntary departure order should be excused (Respondent’s Mot., at 6, 7-8; Respondent’s Affidavit, at ¶ 36). See Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87 (BIA 2007)(alien has not voluntarily failed to depart the United States under section 240B(d)(1) of the Act when the alien, through no fault of his own, was unaware of the voluntary departure order). Under the circumstances, the respondent’s failure to depart under the Board’s voluntary departure order will be excused.
 
In consideration of the respondent’s motion and arguments, the case will be remanded to the Immigration Court for the respondent to pursue an application for adjustment of status.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded in order to afford the respondent an opportunity to present his application for adjustment of status to the Immigration Judge.

File: AXXX XX9 953 - Los Angeles, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Merlyn N. Hernandez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on January 22, 2010, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
On February 22, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider our prior order. In our prior decision we observed that although the respondent indicated that he would supplement his motion to reopen, he had failed to do so. The respondent now asserts that he did submit additional documentation to this Board on or about September 16, 2009. Such documentation shows that he complied with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for presenting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The documentation also establishes his prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1255(i).
 
Giving the respondent the benefit of the doubt that the additional documentation was submitted prior to the issuance of our decision, we will consider the respondent’s prior motion together with the newly submitted documentation. The respondent’s July 24, 2009, motion to reopen was filed five years after we issued a final administrative order in this case on July 26, 2004. Because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether the 90-day motions deadline should be equitably tolled. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that the motions deadline may be equitably tolled where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error).
 
The respondent has demonstrated that he exercised due diligence in pursuing his case. The respondent states that his former counsel represented him for 13 years from March 1996 until around February 2009. The respondent retained former counsel to file a motion to reopen in 2006 so that he could apply for adjustment of status as an immediate relative. In early 2009, he sought a second legal opinion and eventually learned that the 2006 motion had never been filed. On July 21, 2009, as a result of current counsel’s inquiries, counsel acknowledged that he failed to file a motion to reopen in July 2006, as he had agreed to do. He refunded the $3,610 legal fees to the respondent. The respondent filed a motion to reopen shortly thereafter.
 
To successfully raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent must show that (1) counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence; and, (2) he was prejudiced by counsel’s performance, that is, that counsel’s performance was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004).
 
*2 While the respondent has demonstrated that former counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence, he has failed to demonstrate that his case was prejudiced by counsel’s conduct. In July 2006, the respondent sought reopening for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(i) of the Act, based on his wife’s April 2006 naturalization. The evidence of record establishes that the respondent was prima facie eligible for 245(i) adjustment of status at that time. However, even if counsel had promptly filed the motion to reopen in 2006 as agreed, the motion would have been untimely filed. Absent exceptional circumstances, which have not been shown, the motion would have been denied as untimely filed. Accordingly, even though the respondent exercised due diligence, he failed to establish that counsel prejudiced his case. Accordingly, we find no error in our prior decision.
 
Additionally, we find no error in our resolution of the respondent’s due process argument. The respondent asserts that his case should not have been “repapered” and, in any event, it was done without giving him notice pursuant to section 309(c)(3) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA). It is undisputed that he was served with an Order to Show Cause (OSC) on or about December 28, 1994. We recognize that the record is unclear about whether the OSC was actually filed with the Immigration Court and, if so, whether those proceedings had been terminated (Tr. at 21-29). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.14(a) (proceedings commence when the charging document is filed with the Immigration Court by the Service).
 
Regardless, repapering is inapplicable in this case. Even if the respondent had been subject to deportation proceedings, he would not have been subject to the “stop-time rule” in conjunction with an application for suspension of deportation under former section 244(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1234(a). See section 309(c)(5)(A) of the IIRIRA, as amended by section 203(a)(1) of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 (NACARA). See also Matter of Nolasco, 22 I&N Dec. 632 (BIA 1999). The respondent acknowledged that more than 7 years had transpired between the date of his initial entry into the United States and the date of service of the OSC. See Respondent’s July 24, 2009 Motion at 19. See also Memorandum of Bo Cooper, General Counsel for the INS, dated Dec. 7, 1999, reproduced in 77 Interpreter Releases 39, App. 1 (Jan. 10, 2000). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brian C. DiFranco, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The motion is denied. This case was last before the Board on December 18, 2009, when the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). On May 17, 2010, the respondent filed a motion requesting reconsideration and sua sponte reopening. The respondent’s motion is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b), (c). Furthermore, the respondent, who was found to have acquired his lawful permanent resident status through fraud or misrepresentation, has not identified any error of fact or law in the Board’s previous decision that would alter the outcome. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). Cf. Matter of Koloamatangi, 23 I&N Dec. 548 (BIA 2003) (finding that an alien who acquired permanent resident status through fraud or misrepresentation has never been “lawfully admitted for permanent residence” and is therefore ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act). Significantly, we do not find the respondent’s mere disagreement with or disapproval of the outcome of our previous detailed decision sufficient to demonstrate either that we improperly evaluated or disregarded the facts and evidence presented or legal error.
 
Moreover, the respondent has not identified any changed circumstances in Mexico that would have excepted his untimely motion from the applicable time limitations. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The respondent’s motion also fails to comply with both the statutory and regulatory requirements for reopening. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 100.3.2(c). The respondent’s motion does not contain any new or previously unavailable or unobtainable evidence demonstrating the respondent’s eligibility for any other forms of relief.¿FN1º
 
Finally, we find no other reason for this Board’s further consideration of the respondent’s claim on our own motion pursuant to this Board’s sua sponte authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
*2 On this record, we find no reason to overlook the untimeliness of the respondent’s motion. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Nora E. Norman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Continuance, termination
 
The respondent has filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s April 5, 2010, decision. In that decision the Immigration Judge found the respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, removable, as charged, based on his admissions, and concession of removability (Tr. at 9), including his 2009 Florida controlled substance conviction,¿FN1º a “drug-trafficking” aggravated felony offense as defined under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 (a)(43)(B). See also Group Exh. 1. In addition, the Immigration Judge had previously denied the respondent’s request to continue the proceedings while awaiting the result of his post-conviction motion to vacate this conviction. Finally, noting that the respondent had expressed no fear of persecution or torture if returned to Jamaica, and having found the respondent convicted of an aggravated felony offense, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent had failed to establish his statutory eligibility for any relief from removal, and ordered his removal to Jamaica. The appeal will be dismissed. The respondent’s request to proceed on appeal n forma pauperis is granted under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). See Matter of Chicas, 19 I&N Dec. 114 (BIA 1984).
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2010); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in an appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2010); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008) rev’d on other grounds, Kaplun v. Attorney General of the United States, 602 F.3d 260 (3d Cir. 2010); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
*2 At the outset, to the extent the respondent has challenged the Immigration Judge’s findings as to his removability and eligibility for relief from removal, we consider that the distinct and formal concession of removability, made by the respondent’s attorney acting in his professional capacity and in the respondent’s presence during the removal hearing, is binding on the respondent as a judicial admission (Tr. at 9). Applicable regulations, which have the force and effect of law as to the Immigration Judges and this Board, provide in pertinent part that “the immigration judge may determine that removability as charged has been established by the admissions of the respondent.” 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c) (2010). The respondent in the instant case has not established that circumstances exist that would permit the withdrawal of his prior judicial admissions. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made as a tactical decision by an attorney in a deportation proceeding is binding on his alien client); cf 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(B) (authorizing summary dismissal of appeals when “¿tºhe only reason for the appeal specified by the party concerned involves a finding of fact or a conclusion of law that was conceded by that party at a prior proceeding”); see generally Pool Co. v. Cooper, 274 F.3d 173, 185 (5th Cir. 2001) (finding that the court was entitled to treat a concession as a binding judicial admission of fact.); Martinez v. Bally’s Louisiana, Inc., 244 F.3d 474 (5th Cir 2001) (a judicial admission is conclusive, unless the court allows it to be withdrawn).
 
The respondent has also raised a claim of denial of due process premised on his allegations of ineffective assistance by his former attorney’s presentation of his case. Where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is made, the Board has found that certain criteria must be met. Specifically, the claim must be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make, counsel must be informed of the allegations against him and provided an opportunity to respond, and the respondent must indicate whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2006) (citing Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-498 (5 th Cir. 2000) (upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada)). We note the respondent here has failed to meet any of the criteria set forth in Lozada, in order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*3 Moreover, even if we were to consider arguendo the respondent’s contentions on appeal challenging his removability, we find his arguments to be unavailing. The record includes undisputed evidence showing that the respondent was convicted of Possession of Ecstacy with Intent to Sell or Deliver, in violation of FLA. STAT. ANN. § 893.13(1)(a)(1). Although the Palm Beach County Circuit Court withheld adjudication of guilt and placed the respondent on 18 months’ probation, this offense qualifies as a conviction for federal immigration purposes. See INA § 101(a)(48)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A) (defining a “conviction” under the Act, in the case of an alien whose adjudication of guilt has been withheld, as a case where the alien has entered a plea of guilty to an offense and the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien’s liberty to be imposed); see also Madriz-Alvarado v. INS, 383 F.3d 321, 331 (5th Cir. 2004).
 
Furthermore, the respondent’s application for post-conviction relief in the Florida courts does not alter the fact that the 2009 Florida “drug trafficking” aggravated felony conviction may nevertheless be used as the factual predicate for an order of removal or a determination of statutory ineligibility for relief from removal. Specifically, the respondent contends that his conviction may be invalid because he entered a defective guilty plea due to ineffective assistance from criminal counsel. However, the fact that the respondent may be pursuing post-conviction relief in the form of a collateral attack on a conviction in criminal court does not affect its finality for federal immigration purposes, or warrant the grant of a motion to continue. See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992). As a general rule, an Immigration Judge need not hold removal proceedings in abeyance based upon the mere possibility that a collateral criminal proceeding could have a future impact on the alien’s immigration status. The respondent had (and has) a valid “conviction” for immigration purposes, and his collateral attack upon that conviction does not operate to negate its validity until it is in fact overturned or materially amended. Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996).
 
The respondent has presented no evidence with this appeal that any collateral attack on his 2009 Florida conviction underlying these removal proceedings has been vacated, and therefore the respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge’s denial of his continuance request has compromised the fairness of his removal proceedings. The respondent references the recent decision of Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010), in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that a lawyer representing an alien in connection with a guilty plea to a criminal offense has a constitutional duty to advise the alien about the risk of deportation arising from the conviction. However, the respondent’s speculation that his conviction might be invalid, including in light of Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, does not change the finality for immigration purposes of such conviction, unless and until it were to be overturned by a criminal court. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996).
 
*4 Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frank T. Morell, Esquire
 
REISSUED DECISION
 
*1 The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal on February 26, 2009, and denied a previous motion seeking reissuance on July 22, 2009. On November 27, 2009, the respondent, who is from Mexico, filed an untimely and number-barred motion to reopen. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The Board will reopen proceedings under its authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and reissue the February 26, 2009, decision.
 
First, however, to the extent that the respondent seeks reopening as to the merits of the Board’s February 26, 2009, decision, based on ineffective assistance of counsel of prior counsel Ray Antonio Estolano, or pursuant to 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(a), the motion will be denied. In affirming the Immigration Judge, the Board found the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, as being unable to establish the 7 years of continuous residence necessary to qualify for such relief, after being admitted as a lawful permanent resident of the United States on October 10, 1994. Section 240A(d)(1) of the Act.
 
A respondent claiming that he received ineffective assistance of counsel must show that counsel failed to perform with “sufficient competence,” Alcala v. Holder, 563 F.3d 1009, 1019 (9th Cir. 2009), such that proceedings are “so fundamentally unfair that the alien is prevented from reasonably presenting ¿ hisº case.” Torres-Chavez v. Holder, 567 F.3d 1096, 1100 (9th Cir. 2009). The respondent “must also show substantial prejudice by demonstrating that the alleged violation affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Id. (citation omitted); Zetino v. Holder, 596 F.3d 517, 525 (9th Cir. 2010)(a showing of prejudice concerning an alleged due process violation “… means that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged violation”).
 
The motion argues that former counsel did not present facts showing that the respondent resided with his lawful permanent resident parents for 7 years prior to his first adult use of marijuana, in July, 1999. Respondent’s Mot., at 7; Mercado-Zazueta v. Holder, 580 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir. 2009)(alien’s father’s lawful permanent resident status was imputed to the alien when he was an unemancipated minor child living with his father, in order to satisfy the residence requirement of section 240A(a)(1) of the Act).
 
*2 The respondent fails to show that he was prejudiced by counsel’s actions. The respondent testified that he came to live in the United States in 1994 (Tr. at 11-12). His current declaration admits that he has no personal recollection of when he came to live in the United States, and his only evidence in this regard is an immunization record indicating that he may have received an immunization in California in 1992 (Respondent’s Declaration, at ¶ 7; Respondent’s Mot., Exh. A).
 
The motion also argues that his use of marijuana in 1999 was an act of juvenile delinquency which did not render him inadmissible under section 212(a)(2) of the Act and prevent him from establishing 7 years of continuous residence after his admission (Respondent’s Mot., at 8-9). However, as the Immigration Judge found, the respondent turned 18 on July 31, 1999, and smoked marijuana on that date, as well as in 2000 (I.J. at 5; Tr. at 17-20); see also Board’s Feb. 26, 2009, dec. To the extent that the respondent otherwise argues that he should have been found eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, Respondent’s Mot., at 9-12, the Immigration Judge and Board fully considered his testimony and found otherwise. The Board finds no reason to reconsider these decisions. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006)(a motion to reconsider must allege a material factual or legal error, assert that the Board erred in affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision without opinion, or argue a change in law).
 
As to the pending motion’s request for reissuance of the Board’s February 26, 2009, decision, the motion argues that the decision should be reissued, based on Estolano’s actions. That is, in the prior motion seeking reissuance, Estolano admitted that he failed to provide the Board with a change of address form, as required by regulation. The respondent has met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Board’s decision will be reissued and treated as if entered on today’s date. Singh v. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 1170 (9th Cir. 2007) (reissuance of prior Board decision may be warranted).
 
ORDER: The respondent’s pending motion to reissue is granted. In all other respects, the motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated February 26, 2009, attached hereto, is hereby reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s July 22, 2009, denying reissuance is vacated.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: ANGEL HERNANDEZ-CRUZ
File: AXXX XX3 319 - San Antonio, TX
June 28, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pascual Madrigal, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carmen A. Leal
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s March 11, 2010, decision denying his application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1255. The respondent also requests a waiver of the appellate filing fee. The fee waiver request is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility determinations, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was admitted temporarily to the United States as a non-immigrant worker on March 27, 2008, but remained longer than authorized (I.J. at 2; Exh. 2). He is married to a United States citizen and is the beneficiary of an approved Alien Relative Petition (Form I-130) (I.J. at 2; Exh. 5). Based upon the foregoing, through his former counsel, he articulated relief from removal in the form of adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, and he was scheduled for a hearing on the merits of this application to be held on February 1, 2010 (I.J. at 2; Exh. 7).
 
At the February 1, 2010, hearing, the Immigration Judge observed that no adjustment application had been filed with the Immigration Court (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 11 - 13). The Immigration Judge continued the matter until March 11, 2010, and set a deadline of March 4, 2010, for filing the adjustment application and any supporting documents (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 35). The respondent, through former counsel, submitted his application for relief without supporting documentation or a motion to accept late filing on March 8, 2010 (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 39-40, 42-43; Exh. 7). At the March 11, 2010, hearing the respondent’s attorney first sought a further continuance and then attempted to withdraw the respondent’s application for adjustment of status without first consulting with his client (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 54-62). Then, after being given an opportunity to speak to the respondent privately, his attorney indicated that the sole form of relief sought was adjustment of status, and he submitted the case for a decision without further supplementing the record (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 62-64). Based on the foregoing, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s adjustment application (I.J. at 7-8). The Immigration Judge also held that the attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel throughout the course of proceedings as he failed to (1) provide competent representation, (2) act with reasonable promptness and diligence, and (3) adequately communicate with the respondent in violation of 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.102(o), (q), and (r) (I.J. at 3-5).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent, through new counsel, cites his prior attorney’s deficient performance and seeks a remand to further pursue his application for adjustment of status (Resp. Brief at 4). Generally, a motion to remand is subject to the same substantive requirements as a motion to reopen. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). As such, usually a respondent must make a prima facie showing of both statutory and discretionary eligibility for the relief requested. See e.g., INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, supra. Additionally, because the respondent’s remand request is based on ineffective assistance, the general requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), are relevant. According to our holding in Matter of Lozada, a motion based on ineffective assistance generally should be supported by: (1) an affidavit from the aggrieved respondent testifying to the relevant facts, including information about scope of the representation agreement and any alleged breaches by the attorney, (2) evidence that the former attorney has been advised of allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond along with any response offered, and (3) evidence that appropriate disciplinary authorities have been notified or, if not, the reason such notification was not pursued. See id. at 639.
 
This case is unique because the Immigration Judge developed the record and made specific findings of fact with respect to the ineffective assistance provided by the respondent’s former counsel and these findings are relevant to the factors outlined in Matter of Lozada. Specifically, he concluded that the respondent’s former counsel breached his duty to communicate with and keep the respondent apprised of developments in his case, explain the nature of the proceedings against the respondent and the relief available to him, and timely prepare and file the application for relief (I.J. at 3, 5; Tr. at 11-15, 36, 39-55, 59, 63). For example, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent’s counsel did not inform the respondent about the untimely filing of the adjustment application and the respondent first learned about this particular breach on the record at the March 11, 2010 hearing, evidencing one instance of the attorney’s failure to appropriately communicate with the respondent (I.J. at 5; Tr. 44, 50). Additionally, the Immigration Judge also specifically highlighted the attorney’s attempt to withdraw the adjustment application without first consulting with the respondent as another serious breach demonstrating ineffective assistance (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 54-62). In light of these specific findings illustrating the particularly egregious nature of the attorney’s conduct, particularly when coupled with the respondent’s apparent statutory eligibility for adjustment of status, we find that remand is warranted in the interests of justice.¿FN1º See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998) (requiring ineffective assistance be so egregious that it renders the hearing unfair); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640; see also Ogbemudia v. INS, 988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir. 1993) (requiring the respondent to demonstrate “substantial prejudice” in order to establish that a hearing was fundamentally unfair). On remand, the parties may supplement the record as necessary to assist the Immigration Judge in adjudicating the application for relief.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

On appeal, the Department of Homeland Security maintains that the removal order should be upheld as the respondent failed to submit an affidavit of support below, and thus, he cannot establish that he is admissible and that he is not a public charge (DHS Brief at 2). While this is an accurate characterization of the record, we cannot conclude that the failure to submit a legally sufficient affidavit of support can be separated from the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim, as the claim is based in part on the attorney’s failure to communicate with him. As such, this failure to communicate appears to have infected the entirety of the proceedings.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kamah Thoronka, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Deborah Todd
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 29, 2008, granting the respondent the privilege of voluntarily departing the United States pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). On appeal, the respondent claims, through present counsel, that he was ineffectively represented at his hearing before the Immigration Judge. The respondent has not presented any evidence in support of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and does not identify any evidence before the Immigration Judge that supports his assertion that his prior attorney never advised him of other potential relief. Indeed, the record indicates that prior counsel explored all possibilities with the respondent (Tr. at 3). The statements of respondent’s present counsel on appeal are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980). The respondent’s uncorroborated assertion on appeal, through counsel, is insufficient to establish that his prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance in this matter. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Inasmuch as the respondent has failed to establish that his former counsel rendered ineffective assistance in this matter, the respondent has failed to establish that the waiver of appeal required in order to receive voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act was unknowing and involuntary. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D). Therefore, the respondent, through former counsel, waived appeal and the appeal he has filed with this Board is improper. This Board has no jurisdiction over the respondent’s appeal because he necessarily waived appeal in order to receive the extended period of voluntary departure he pursued through former counsel. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The Immigration Judge’s decision in this matter was final on October 29, 2008, to the same extent as if no appeal was taken. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Termination; remand
 
In a decision dated March 3, 2010, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable based on his concessions and, since no application for relief had been filed, ordered him removed to Mexico. The respondent’s appeal of that decision will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) failed to submit evidence to establish that the respondent was present without being admitted or paroled. Although he asserts that he has withdrawn all prior concessions to the charges of removability (see Tr. at 2), the Immigration Judge did not permit the respondent to do so because the only reason given for the request was that the respondent had a new attorney; no allegations of ineffective assistance were made and the respondent did not present evidence to meet the procedural requirements for such a claim or to show that he was prejudiced.¿FN1º The Immigration Judge also noted that the respondent and his current counsel had sufficient time, after numerous continuances, in which to gather and submit evidence to support the respondent’s claim that he had been lawfully admitted or paroled into the United States and, therefore, was not removable (I.J. at 4-5).
 
On appeal, the respondent again does not assert ineffective assistance of counsel and also provides no evidence to support his continuing claim of lawful entry into the United States. We can find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable as charged. Since no applications for relief have been submitted and the respondent does not allege eligibility for any form of relief, we decline to remand proceedings.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent argues that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance by conceding the charge of removability and that the Immigration Judge should have found that he is not removable pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(A), with reference to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i), of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(1)(A), 1182(a)(6)(C)(i). We find, however, that the respondent’s prior attorney conceded removability, as so charged, and that concession of removability is binding on the respondent. See Tr. at 15, 19; Hoodho v. Holder, 558 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir. 2009) (holding that “facts admitted by a party are ‘judicial admissions that bind th¿atº ¿partyº throughout th¿eº litigation.”’). While the respondent claims ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not complied with the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The respondent argues in the alternative that the Immigration Judge should not have pretermitted his application for adjustment of status. The Immigration Judge pretermitted the application, finding that the respondent did not meet the threshold requirement for statutory eligibility to demonstrate that he is not likely to become a public charge and thus would not be inadmissible to the United States. In particular, the respondent submitted an Affidavit of Support (Form I-864) with his spouse as his sponsor. The Immigration Judge concluded that the income his spouse listed on the form does not meet the minimum household income requirement based on the DHS attorney’s statement that the 2008 poverty guidelines for a family of four require an income of $26,500 (Tr. at 27). The respondent argues that the Affidavit of Support met the threshold requirement because it included his income in addition to his wife’s income.
 
*2 An affidavit of support is sufficient if it demonstrates that a sponsor’s:
reasonably expected household income for the year in which the intending immigrant filed the application for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status … would equal at least 125 percent of the Federal poverty line for the sponsor’s household size as defined in 8 CFR 213a.1, under the Poverty Guidelines in effect when the intending immigrant filed the application for an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status ….
 
8 C.F.R. § 213a.2(c)(2)(ii)(C). Under the regulations, “household income” is defined as “the income used to determine whether the sponsor meets the minimum income requirements under sections 213A(f)(1)(E), 213A(f)(3), or 213A(f)(5) of the Act” and includes the income of the sponsor, and of the sponsor’s spouse and any other person included in determining the sponsor’s household size, if the spouse or other person is at least 18 years old and has signed a Form I-864A. 8 C.F.R. § 213a.1. The “household income may not include the income of the intending immigrant, “unless the intending immigrant is either the sponsor’s spouse or has the same principal residence as the sponsor and the preponderance of the evidence shows that the intending immigrant’s income results from the intending immigrant’s lawful employment in the United States or from some other lawful source that will continue to be available to the intending immigrant after he or she acquires permanent resident status.” 8 C.F.R. § 213a.1 (emphasis added). Further, the instructions to the Form I-864 state that the income requirements can be met using income from the intending immigrant if the income will continue from the same source after he or she becomes a lawful permanent resident.
 
The respondent’s application for adjustment of status (Form I-485) was filed with the Immigration Judge in 2007, and therefore, the sponsor’s “reasonably expected household income” for 2007 is given the greatest evidentiary weight in this case. The Affidavit of Support, filed in 2007, indicates that the current total annual household income is $32,172.10, including the respondent’s income (Respondent’s Application for Adjustment of Status at Attachment 10). The regulations and the instructions to the Form I-864 specifically acknowledge situations where a sponsored alien’s own income may be counted towards meeting the income requirements of the Affidavit of Support. The Immigration Judge did not consider whether the respondent’s income could be included in the sponsor’s household income under the regulations. We find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further fact finding with regard to the Affidavit of Support and to determine whether the respondent is otherwise statutorily eligible for, as well as deserving of, adjustment of status. We note that if more than 1 year has elapsed since the submission of the Form I-864 the regulations provide the Immigration Judge with the discretion to request more current information if necessary to the proper adjudication of the case. 8 C.F.R. § 213a.2(a)(1)(v)(B).
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained in part.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pascual Madrigal, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Justin Adams
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision of March 10, 2010, denying his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) (the “Act”). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493, 497 (BIA 2008). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); see also Matter of Almanza-Arenas, 24 I&N Dec. 771, 775 (BIA 2009).
 
The Immigration Judge first determined that the respondent had not met his burden of proving statutory eligibility for cancellation of removal, given his inconclusive proof as to the date he was admitted as a temporary permanent resident (I.J. at 3-5). The Immigration Judge next made the discretionary determination that, after weighing the respondent’s long list of arrests and convictions against his positive equities, the respondent failed to prove his continued desirability as a resident of the United States (I.J. at 5-8).
 
The respondent first argues that he demonstrated statutory eligibility for the form of relief requested, given that no offense occurred within 7 years of his admission on May 4, 1988. The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge erred in considering the respondent’s arrest for robbery as a negative discretionary factor because no records were available to show the disposition of the case. Finally, the respondent argues that his attorney’s failure to advise him of the need to have an I-130 petition filed by his common law wife after divorcing his present wife constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. We will address each argument in turn.
 
Even assuming that the respondent satisfied the three statutory prerequisites for relief under section 240A(a) of the Act, he also must also establish that he warrants such relief as a matter of discretion. Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998). The respondent has not done so. Rather, the Immigration Judge properly balanced the negative factors and positive equities in determining that the respondent did not merit a grant of relief in the exercise of discretion. The Immigration Judge considered, inter alia, the respondent’s long residence in the United States and work history, as well as his girlfriend’s serious medical condition, but found that his criminal record, including convictions of aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury and possession of cocaine, outweighed these factors (I.J. at 6-7; Tr. at 45-49). Although the respondent assigns error to the consideration of his arrest for robbery, this is only one among a list of offenses that weigh against granting cancellation of removal. The respondent presented no evidence here that effectively offset unfavorable factors. Therefore, we agree that the respondent has failed to demonstrate his continued desirability as a resident of the United States.
 
*2 Lastly, the respondent’s allegation regarding deficient advice has not established a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, as he has failed to comply with the standards set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jason Goodchild
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Termination
 
The respondent, a native of the Dominican Republic and a lawful permanent resident of the United States since October 5, 1995, has filed a timely appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 16, 2010. In that decision, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable, as charged, on account of his 2007 New York conviction for the offense of assault in the second degree,¿FN1º which he found to be a conviction for a “crime of violence” aggravated felony, as defined under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F) (Exh. 2). The appeal will be dismissed. The respondent’s request to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is granted under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). See Matter of Chicas, 19 I&N Dec. 114 (BIA 1984).
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2010); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in an appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2010); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008) rev’d on other grounds, Kaplun v. Attorney General of the United States, 602 F.3d 260 (3d Cir. 2010); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The principal issue raised by the respondent on appeal concerns the Immigration Judge’s finding of removability. Upon our de novo review, however, we are not persuaded to disturb the Immigration Judge conclusion that the respondent’s 2007 New York conviction for the offense of assault in the second degree qualifies as a “crime of violence” under 18 U.S.C. § 16,¿FN2º and an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, and that there was no basis to grant the respondent’s request to terminate proceedings. We agree with the Immigration Judge and find that the respondent’s conviction is a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. § 16(b).
 
*2 To determine whether an offense is a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. § 16(b), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, employs a “categorical approach,” which looks to the generic elements of the statutory offense and asks whether the criminal conduct required to violate the applicable statute is “by its nature” a crime of violence. See, e.g., Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, 462 F.3d 456, 463-65 (5th Cir. 2006). In other words, the pertinent question is whether the crime inherently involves a substantial risk that intentional physical force will be used in the commission of the crime.¿FN3º See Leocal v. Ashcroft, supra, at 383 (holding that 18 U.S.C § 16(b) “covers offenses that naturally involve a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical force might be used against another in committing an offense”); see also Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, supra, at 465. Before we may consider whether the respondent’s conviction so qualifies, we must first examine the statutory elements of New York’s assault in the second degree statute.
 
However, before we do so, we note that NY PENAL LAW § 120.05 is a divisible statute - that is, it encompasses offenses that both are and are not crimes of violence. See NY PENAL LAW § 120.05. See generally Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, supra, at 463-65; see also Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 20-21 (2005). Divisible statutes require what is referred to as a “modified categorical approach,” in which we must first look to the record of conviction to determine whether the actual offense of which the alien was convicted qualifies as a crime of violence. See Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, supra. In making this determination, we may consider any of the following documents: the charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented. See id; see also Shepard v. United States, supra.
 
The respondent’s record of conviction reflects that he was convicted of violating subsection 2 of NY PENAL LAW § 120.05. This particular subsection provides that a person is guilty of assault in the second degree when “¿wºith intent to cause physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument” (emphasis added). NY PENAL LAW § 120.05(2). Under New York law, this offense is classified as a class D felony. See NY PENAL LAW § 60.05(5). As such, at the time of the respondent’s conviction, assault in the second degree was punishable by a maximum term of 7 years imprisonment. See NY PENAL LAW § 70.00(2)(d). Because the respondent’s crime was punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of more than 1 year, it also qualifies as a federal felony. See 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(4). Thus, his offense is unquestionably a “felony” within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 16(b). United States v. Villegas-Hernandez, 468 F.3d 874, 884 (5th Cir. 2006).
 
*3 Moreover, we find that the crime for which the respondent was convicted involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property or another may be used because the elements of intent and actual physical injury are both present. Cf. United States v. Calderon-Pena, 383 F.3d 254, 260-61 (5th Cir. 2004) (contrasting crimes that actually involve the use or attempted use of physical force against the person of another with crimes, like child endangerment, that only create a risk of injury). See generally Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, supra.
 
The Fifth Circuit has ruled that, in considering whether an offense is a crime of violence, it is appropriate to determine the “ordinary, usual way the crime is committed,” not whether it is “possible” to commit the offense without the use of physical force. Perez-Munoz v. Keisler, 507 F.3d 357, 364 (5th Cir. 2007) (“Being able to imagine unusual ways the crime could be committed without the use of physical force does not prevent it from qualifying as a crime of violence under § 16(b).”) Although the offense may be committed without physical force actually being used against the person of another, it is evident from the terms of the statute that, in the ordinary case, an individual who commits such an offense necessarily disregards the substantial risk that, in the course of committing it, he might be required to intentionally use physical force against his victims. See James v. United States, 127 S. Ct. 1586 (2007). Therefore the offense, which is a felony under New York law, qualifies as a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. § 16(b), and an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, rendering the removable on that basis. See Leocal v. Ashcroft, supra.
 
Finally, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s appellate contentions that he was denied constitutional due process, first by the Immigration Judge, and secondly, by his former counsel, based on allegations of ineffective assistance in the presentation of his case.
 
Initially, we find no support for the respondent’s claim that he was denied constitutional due process by the Immigration Judge. We have held an alien must demonstrate that he has been prejudiced by a violation of a procedural rule or regulation before his deportation proceeding will be invalidated. Matter of Garcia-Flores, 17 I&N Dec. 325, 329 (BIA 1980). This is consistent with the rule that an alien must have been prejudiced by a procedural defect in his deportation proceeding before he will be found to have suffered a denial of due process. See Ka Fung Chan v. INS, 634 F.2d 248, 258 (5th Cir. 1981). In the matter before us, no such prejudice has been shown. The respondent’s appellate contentions as to “entrapment” and the giving of wrong information by the Immigration Judge are belied by the record. Moreover, the record reflects that the respondent, represented by counsel, had ample opportunity to prepare for and address the removal charges. Finally, to the extent the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge “never allowed ¿himº to excise (sic) ¿hisº rights to the mitigate the facts of ¿hisº case,” ignores the fact that having been convicted of an aggravated felony offense, the respondent is statutorily precluded from establishing his eligibility for almost all forms of relief from removal, including cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3), such that there are no mitigating circumstances for the Immigration Judge to consider.
 
*4 The respondent’s arguments in the nature of collateral attacks on his conviction are not properly before us for consideration, as neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board can entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to determine the guilt or innocence of the respondent. Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996); Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1034 (BIA 1999). The respondent has presented no new evidence to indicate that his 2007 New York conviction for the offense of assault in the second degree, has been overturned, vacated, or expunged; rather, the evidence merely indicates that the respondent’s post judgment motion has been scheduled before a judge.¿FN4º Furthermore, there is no objective evidence in the record to indicate that the respondent was misadvised regarding the potential immigration consequences of his guilty plea. See Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).
 
The respondent has also raised a claim of denial of due process premised on his allegations of ineffective assistance by his former attorney’s presentation of his case. Where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is made, the Board has found that certain criteria must be met. Specifically, the claim must be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make, counsel must be informed of the allegations against him and provided an opportunity to respond, and the respondent must indicate whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2006) (citing Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-498 (5 th Cir. 2000) (upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada)). We note the respondent here has failed to meet any of the criteria set forth in Lozada, in order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Nonetheless, we find that there is nothing in the record, nor has the respondent provided any evidence, to suggest that his former counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair.
 
Based on the record before us, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is subject to removal from the United States based on the respondent’s admissions and record of conviction (Exh. 2). See section 240(c)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A). Moreover, having expressed no fear of persecution or torture if returned to the Dominican Republic, the respondent has failed to establish his eligibility for any relief from removal, including cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a)(3) of the Act. See section 240(c)(4)(A)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d).
 
*5 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The record reflects that on March 8, 2007, the respondent was convicted in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, of the offense of assault in the second degree, in violation of NY PENAL LAW § 120.05(2), for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years (Exh.2).

2

Under 18 U.S.C. § 16, the term “crime of violence” means either “(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or (b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.”

3

To illustrate the intended reach of 18 U.S.C. § 16(b), in Leocal the Court explained how that section would apply to the crime of burglary. “A burglary would be covered under § 16(b) not because the offense can be committed in a generally reckless way or because someone may be injured, but because burglary, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victim in completing the crime.” Leocal v. Ashcroft, supra.

4

Notwithstanding, we note that in the Fifth Circuit the pendency of a direct appeal has no effect on the validity of a criminal conviction for immigration purposes. Garcia-Maldonado v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 284, 290-91 (5 th Cir. 2007); Moosa v. INS, 171 F.3d 994, 1009 (5th Cir. 1999); see also Puello v. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Servs., 511 F.3d 324, 332 (2d Cir. 2007); United States v. Saenz-Gomez, 472 F.3d 791, 794 (10th Cir. 2007); Montenegro v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 1035, 1037 (7th Cir. 2004) (per curiam). Thus, even assuming arguendo that the respondent’s 2007 New York conviction for the offense of assault in the second degree was pending on direct appeal, and not on a motion for post-conviction relief, in the jurisdiction of the Fifth Circuit, this would not prevent it from being used as the factual predicate for an order of removal or a determination of statutory ineligibility for relief from removal.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrew P. Johnson, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On November 23, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings in which he claims to have received ineffective assistance of counsel. He contends that his former counsel failed to notify him about his immigration court hearing until the night before, when it was too late for the respondent to make the trip from New York to Atlanta. The respondent’s failure to attend his hearing led to his being ordered removed in absentia. The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a reply to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must substantially comply with the requirements set out in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1221-23 (11th Cir. 2003). In Lozada, we required: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639.
 
The respondent’s motion states that he has filed a bar complaint against his former counsel and that a copy has been included with the motion as Exhibit F (Mot. at ¶ 19). The motion also states that the former attorney has been sent a copy of the bar complaint (Mot. at ¶ 22). However, the motion before us has no copy of a bar complaint and no Exhibit F. Nor is there evidence to show that the respondent’s former counsel has been advised of the allegations against him. Because the motion to reopen does not substantially comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, the motion will be denied. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 1221-23 (11th Cir. 2003).
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

Leslie S. Evans
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on August 26, 2009, when we denied the respondent’s untimely filed motion to reopen proceedings. On November 24, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen in which he alleged ineffective assistance by his prior attorney because that attorney failed to file a timely motion to reopen after the respondent advised the attorney that he planned to marry a United States citizen. The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
With certain exceptions, an alien is entitled to file only one motion to reopen and the motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s motion is a second motion to reopen and was filed more than 3 years after this Board’s final administrative order, which was entered on August 4, 2006. The respondent’s motion is untimely and number-barred unless it falls within an exception to the filing requirements.
 
Under the controlling law of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, aliens raising ineffective assistance of counsel claims in a motion may have the time limits on motions equitably tolled. See Iavorski v. U.S. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 129-33 (2d Cir. 2000). “In a situation where fraud or concealment of the existence of a claim prevents an individual from timely filing, equitable tolling of a statute of limitations is permitted until the fraud or concealment is, or should have been, discovered by a reasonable person in the situation.” Id. at 134.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must substantially comply with the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that the following requirements apply: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The Second Circuit has held that an alien who has failed to comply substantially with the Lozada requirements in a motion to reopen before the Board forfeits his or her ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the court of appeals. See Jian Yun Zheng v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005).
 
*2 The respondent’s motion does not reflect that the respondent has informed his former counsel of the allegations leveled against him and that the former counsel has been given an opportunity to respond. Thus, the respondent has not met an important requirement for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639 (given the potential for abuse, the alien’s former counsel must be given an opportunity to present his version of events if he so chooses).
 
The respondent’s motion also does not include a detailed statement concerning the agreement the respondent entered into with his former counsel. The respondent’s affidavit states that he advised his former counsel that he planned to marry a United States citizen. However, the respondent does not set out any details about what occurred after he actually married or what his agreement was with his former counsel once the marriage took place. The respondent’s affidavit does not even specifically indicate that he was in contact with his former attorney between the time of the marriage and the end of the 90-day period during which a timely motion to reopen could have been filed.
 
Additionally, the respondent has not established prejudice. The record reflects that the visa petition filed on behalf of the respondent by his United States citizen wife was ultimately denied on May 13, 2009, because the couple did not attend their interview. Accordingly, the respondent has not shown that the actions of his former counsel actually affected the outcome of his case. The respondent’s motion, which was filed by new counsel, states that the respondent was specifically told by his former attorney not to attend his “Stokes interview” (Mot. at 3). However, the respondent’s attached affidavit does not include this allegation (Exh. B). Nor is there other evidence included with the motion to support a claim that the former attorney had a role in the denial of the visa petition.¿FN1º Without an approved visa petition, the respondent cannot adjust his status. Thus, the former attorney’s failure to file a timely motion to reopen for the purpose of seeking adjustment of status has not been shown to have resulted in prejudice.
 
Because the respondent has not substantially complied with the requirements of Lozada and has not established prejudice, his motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: DUANE LYN
File: AXXX XX9 636 - York, PA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sara Elizabeth Dill, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William E. Lore
Senior Attorney
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision mailed on April 24, 2009, that denied his motion to reopen based on his removal from the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) supports the decision of the Immigration Judge. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
On December 28, 2005, an Immigration Judge issued a final order in the respondent’s case. The then-detained respondent was granted a period of voluntary departure “under safeguards” until January 26, 2006, with an alternate order of removal to Jamaica. The respondent waived the right to appeal to the Board. On December 31, 2005, respondent’s prior counsel mailed the DHS the documents necessary to effectuate the respondent’s departure. As it developed, however, the respondent was unable to depart “under safeguards” because on January 10, 2006, the DHS was obliged to turn him over to Pennsylvania state authorities for criminal prosecution. On June 6, 2006, the respondent was convicted of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to deliver and was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of not less than two years. On September 24, 2007, upon completion of his sentence and long after his period of voluntary departure expired, the respondent was removed from the United States to Jamaica.
 
Years later, on April 21, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. The motion sought, inter alia, to have the Immigration Judge vacate the prior order of removal so that the respondent could voluntarily depart, or seek adjustment of status. The motion revealed that the respondent either entered or sought to reenter the United States sometime before May 28, 2008.¿FN1º The Immigration Judge ultimately found that he lacked jurisdiction over the motion due to the respondent’s removal from the United States. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge properly found himself without jurisdiction over the motion. In Matter of Armendarez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008), the Board held that it lacks jurisdiction to reopen proceedings if the alien departed after those administrative proceedings were completed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d). The Board in Matter of Armendarez, supra, recognized that 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) imposed a similar departure bar rule to motions filed before Immigration Judges. The respondent argues that the Board’s interpretation of its regulations has been invalidated in certain circuit court decisions (Respondent’s Br. at 15). As the Immigration Judge correctly observed, however, I.J. at 2, jurisdiction over this case rests with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and “… the Third Circuit has not held that 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), or any similar regulations, are invalid.” Accordingly, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s jurisdictional ruling.
 
*2 We separately note, however, that the respondent’s motion was long since untimely filed. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent urges that the proceedings nonetheless should be reopened sua sponte. However, we find no exceptional circumstances that would warrant the sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997)(stating that “¿tºhe power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”).
 
We note that the Immigration Judge properly determined that Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U.S. 1, 128 S.Ct. 2307, 2320 (2008), did not require a different result in this case, as the Supreme Court specifically declined to address 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d), the regulation deeming a motion to reopen filed with the Board withdrawn when the alien departs the United States. Moreover, the Immigration Judge properly considered, Dada v. Mukasey, supra, concerned a situation where the alien sought to withdraw a voluntary departure request prior to its expiration. This is not the situation with the respondent.
 
The respondent’s brief argues that the departure bar rule should not apply to him because he was “physically unable to comply with his voluntary departure order” (Respondent’s Br. at 11-13, 15-17, 19). However, at the time that voluntary departure period expired on January 26, 2006, the respondent was not detained by the DHS, but by state authorities concerning a criminal charge (Respondent’s Br. at 2, Exh. H). Thus, the respondent was not prevented from voluntarily departing by the DHS. The respondent urges that he did not fail to depart “voluntarily”, citing Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87 (BIA 2007). However, this is not a case where the failure to depart was “through no fault of his … own.” Id at 94. Rather, the respondent’s inability to voluntarily depart resulted from his own criminal misconduct that lead to his conviction and two-year sentence of imprisonment.
 
When the voluntary departure period expired, the respondent (after serving time in prison for a criminal conviction) was properly removed to Jamaica based on the alternate order of removal entered by the Immigration Judge on December 28, 2005. See Respondent’s Br. at 2; Chedid v. Holder, 573 F.3d 33, 34 (1st Cir. 2009)(Immigration Judge granted voluntary departure, with an alternate order of removal, “in case Chedid failed to comply with the grant of voluntary departure by the deadline …”); Mambwe v. Holder, 572 F.3d 540, 546 (8th Cir. 2009)(voluntary departure period granted, after which the alternate order of removal would take effect).
 
*3 Although the respondent argues on appeal that he was “never given the chance to defend his case or present evidence,” Respondent’s Br. at 13, in fact he appeared before an Immigration Judge on December 28, 2005, who issued the removal order.¿FN2º
 
The respondent also wrongly claims that he was not given notice of the removal order, and his right to due process was thereby violated (Respondent’s Br. at 17-19). In fact, the Immigration Judge rendered an oral decision on December 28, 2005, and a summary of her order was provided to the respondent or his counsel.
 
The respondent’s motion and brief alternatively argue that the untimeliness of his motion should be excused because he received ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the motion did not comply with the procedural requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Further, the respondent’s filing, which is unsupported by his own affidavit and leaves various relevant dates unspecified, does not adequately show that he acted with diligence such that the motions deadline should be tolled.¿FN3º See Mahmood v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 248, 252 (3d Cir. 2005) (party in immigration proceedings who brings an untimely motion to reopen claiming that he has received ineffective assistance of counsel must show that he acted with diligence before equitable tolling will extend the filing deadline).
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed because we agree with the decision of the Immigration Judge. However, even if the provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) were not found applicable, his motion would be properly denied as untimely filed.
 
ORDER: The decision of the Immigration Judge is affirmed.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: SOK KUAN LEI
File: AXXX XX1 487 - Los Angeles, CA
May 27, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kathleen S. Koh, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 29, 2009. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider the denial of her motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia. On appeal, the respondent argues that “¿tºhe Immigration Judge erred in finding that the respondent did not present extraordinary circumstances (medical illness and ineffective assistance of counsel) that prevented her from appearing for her master hearing.” The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
A motion to reconsider is a request that the Board or the Immigration Judge reexamine the previous decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked, while a motion to reopen is usually based upon new evidence or a change in factual circumstances. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 n.1 (BIA 1991). As the Immigration Judge recognized, despite being characterized as a motion to reconsider, the respondent’s motion did not specify errors of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s prior decision, based on the evidence that was previously presented to the Immigration Judge, but rather sought to present evidence, such as a doctor’s letter, evidence of an approved visa petition (Form I-130) and documentation regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, not previously submitted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2). As the respondent’s motion did not specify errors of law or fact in the Immigration Judge’s prior decision based on evidence previously presented, the motion to reconsider was properly denied by the Immigration Judge.
 
Inasmuch as the respondent sought to present evidence that was not previously submitted, the motion is properly characterized as a motion to reopen. However, the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(4) provides that a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings where the party is the subject of an in absentia order of removal. In this matter, the respondent previously filed a motion to reopen, which was denied by the Immigration Judge on February 19, 2009. Hence, we decline to reopen for consideration of the doctor’s letter or evidence of the approved I-130.
 
*2 Lastly, to the extent that the respondent argued in her motion to reconsider that the Immigration Judge should have permitted the respondent to comply with the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and, J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), given the date of its issuance, we note that on June 3, 2009, the Attorney General vacated the decision in Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, supra. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). Even if the respondent was unaware of the issuance of Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), at the time she filed her motion to reopen, the respondent should have complied with the less rigorous evidentiary requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), which required submission of (i) an affidavit setting forth the agreement between the alien and counsel and the basis for the alleged ineffective assistance claim; (ii) evidence that former counsel was informed of the allegation and was given an opportunity to respond; and (iii) evidence that a complaint was prepared for submission to the appropriate disciplinary authorities.
 
In light of the foregoing, we find that the respondent has failed to demonstrate that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her motion to reconsider. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: MIGUEL GUTIERREZ-OCHOA
File: AXXX XX9 049 - Buffalo, NY
May 24, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
L. Manuel Macias, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert P. Levy
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before the Board on June 9, 2009, when we determined that the respondent’s interlocutory appeal became moot upon the Immigration Judge’s decision of May 1, 2009, ordering the respondent removed in absentia. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 24, 2009, denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in characterizing his claim as one of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent claims that his attorney, Mr. L. Manuel Macias, previously filed an appeal with the Board regarding the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to change venue, and Mr. Macias erroneously changed his internal records to indicate that the respondent had no upcoming hearings before the Immigration Court. Mr. Macias claims that the administrative error was his fault and not the fault of the respondent, such that reopening is warranted based on exceptional circumstances, or that the case should be reopened sua sponte.
 
An order issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1).
 
As the respondent’s attorney received notice of the hearing, proper notice was provided to the respondent. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). The respondent did not establish that he failed to appear for the hearing due to “exceptional circumstances,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act. Furthermore, the Board has held that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the respondent of his responsibility to appear, and unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988); Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 1985), aff’d, Patel v. INS, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986).
 
*2 We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). In a decision dated June 3, 2009, the Attorney General determined that the Board and Immigration Judges should apply the pre-Compean standards to all pending and future motions to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, regardless of when such motions were filed. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A.G. 2009). Consequently, in his decision of June 24, 2009, the Immigration Judge correctly applied Lozada when he adjudicated the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
An attorney’s administrative error or his failure to advise a client that a change of venue motion had not been granted and that he must appear for the hearing is not a basis for reopening absent compliance with Lozada. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established ineffective assistance of counsel for his failure to appear. The respondent has not submitted an affidavit asserting that he failed to appear due to ineffective assistance of counsel, nor did he indicate that a disciplinary complaint had been filed against his attorney. The Immigration Judge correctly determined that reopening is not warranted in this matter, as the respondent has made no attempt to comply with the requirements set forth in Lozada.
 
Finally, the respondent requests that the Board exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen his removal proceedings. We find that the facts presented in this case do not warrant an intervention of our sua sponte authority to reopen the proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

May 24, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 2, 2009, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and reinstated a period of 60 days’ voluntary departure. On November 3, 2009, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen. The filing of his motion to reopen within the reinstated voluntary departure period automatically terminates the prior grant of voluntary departure. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(e)(1) & (2). The previously-entered voluntary departure order will therefore be vacated. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion.
 
Applicable regulations provide that a motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent urges in his motion that certain evidence pertaining to his father was not submitted because he was advised against it by his attorney, and that there were some deficiencies in the translation of his testimony at the hearing. The respondent, however, despite stating that he would submit evidence later to supplement his motion, has submitted no affidavits or other evidentiary material in support of his motion to reopen. Nor has he identified any particular translation errors or shown how they affected his case. Moreover, we point out that his vague claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not meet any of the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), such that he has properly raised such a claim. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s October 2, 2009, order reinstating voluntary departure is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s alternate order of removal to Macedonia is now in effect.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ana Maria Bazan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The final administrative decision was issued by the Board on April 26, 2010, and the Board subsequently granted a stay of removal. The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, has filed a timely motion to reopen and remand the proceedings for consideration of an application for adjustment of status (based on his marriage to a United States citizen) in conjunction with an application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The motion is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel, and the respondent has met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Given the respondent’s submission and the lack of opposition by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the motion to reopen will be granted.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). We decide the issues on appeal de novo.
 
The respondent acknowledges on appeal that the Notice of Hearing was mailed to 6141 Hazelton Avenue, Van Nuys, California 91401, the address reflected on his June 18, 2002, motion to change venue. According to the respondent, his former counsel provided an incorrect address therein on his behalf. The respondent denies having received notice of his hearing.
 
The alleged failure of a counsel to provide the Immigration Court with the respondent’s correct address would appear to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, and it perhaps would be an “exceptional circumstance” warranting reopening of these proceedings. However, the respondent must have filed his motion to reopen based on “exceptional circumstances” within 180 days of the order of removal. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). Because a request for reopening based on “exceptional circumstances” was not made within 180 days of the date of the respondent’s order of removal, it is barred from consideration. The respondent has also not satisfied any of the procedural requirements for asserting a claim for reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir. 2004); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 638 (BIA 1988).
 
We do not find that a failure of notice occurred herein. The respondent is not entitled to receive notice of his hearing on account of the failure to provide the Immigration Court with a correct mailing address. See section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(5)(B).
 
The respondent further argues on appeal that the Notice to Appear is not genuine or authentic. We have reviewed the document, and it appears on its face to contain all the indicia of reliability. It contains the factual allegations giving rise to a charge of removability, is issued and signed by an authorized individual, and it is personally served on the respondent. The respondent has not identified any aspect of the Notice to Appear that would suggest that it is not a genuine document issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The DHS is not required, as argued on appeal, to establish the chain of custody of the Notice to Appear. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeffrey T. Bubier
Senior Attorney
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Removability; remand
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 17, 2010, decision finding him removable as charged and ordering him removed to the Dominican Republic. The Department of Homeland Security seeks a summary affirmance. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872 (BIA 1994). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s 2001 conviction for the Attempted Criminal Sale of a Controlled Substance (cocaine) in violation of section 110-220.39 of the New York State Penal Law qualifies as an aggravated felony. Section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B); Evanson v. U.S. Att’y General, 550 F.3d 284, 288 (3d Cir. 2008).
 
The respondent seeks a remand based upon his claim that his criminal case has been reopened, and thus his drug conviction is not final for immigration purposes (Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 4-6). The respondent has submitted new evidence on appeal, including a letter from the Supreme Court of New York County to support his claim. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The new evidence does not indicate that the respondent’s 2001 conviction has been overturned, vacated, or expunged; rather, the evidence merely indicates that the respondent’s post judgment motion has been scheduled before a judge. Therefore, the respondent’s reliance upon Pinho v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 193 (3d Cir. 2005), is misplaced. The respondent also argues on appeal that his guilty plea was involuntary, and he was not advised of his constitutional rights at the time of his guilty plea (Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 6); however, there is no objective evidence in the record to support the respondent’s assertions.
 
*2 The respondent’s arguments are in the nature of collateral attacks on his conviction; however, neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board can entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to determine the guilt or innocence of the respondent. Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996); Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1034 (BIA 1999).
 
The respondent also alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, yet he has not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Mudric v. U.S. Att’y General, 469 F.3d 94, 100 (3d Cir. 2006) (affirming the Board’s denial of a motion to reopen for failure to comply with the procedural requirements of Lozada). Furthermore, there is no objective evidence in the record to indicate that the respondent was misadvised regarding the potential immigration consequences of his guilty plea. See Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010). Accordingly, based upon the evidence in the record, we conclude that the respondent’s conviction is final for immigration purposes and a remand is not warranted.¿FN1º 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). In view of the foregoing, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

On April 5, 2010, the Board received the respondent’s motion to hold his appeal in abeyance, in which he alleges a due process violation, contends that the transcripts of his proceedings are missing, and argues that the Board is unable to fully review the respondent’s claims (see also respondent’s March 17, 2010, motion requesting transcripts). We deny the respondent’s April 5, 2010, motion and note that the record contains all of the transcripts pertaining to the respondent. Additionally, in his April 12, 2010, appeal brief the respondent does not assert that the transcripts are missing or unavailable or that he was unable to prepare his appeal brief due to missing transcripts.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Murray Hilts, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alec J. Niziolek
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; waiver under former section 212(c) of the Act
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s February 18, 2010, decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings to apply for relief pursuant to former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). The Department of Homeland Security seeks a summary affirmance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872 (BIA 1994). Although the respondent concedes that his motion to reopen is untimely, he claims that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled based upon ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 18). The respondent, however, has not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and the record does not show that his ineffective assistance claim is legitimate. See Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 588 (9th Cir. 2006).
 
The respondent also contends on appeal that he is eligible for equitable tolling because the Immigration Judge who presided over his 1998 hearing violated due process by failing to advise the respondent of his eligibility for a 212(c) waiver. He also asserts that his appeal waiver was not knowing and voluntary, and a change in the law has resulted in more than a reasonable likelihood that the respondent is eligible for 212(c) relief.
 
We disagree with the respondent’s contentions. See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001); Valeriano v. Gonzales, 474 F.3d 669, 673 (9th Cir. 2007) (alien was not entitled to equitable tolling of limitations period for filing motion to reopen removal proceedings). The Immigration Judge in 1998 applied the law then applicable, which did not extend section 212(c) relief to the respondent. At the time of the hearing, section 212(c) had been repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, and the Supreme Court had not yet issued INS v. St. Cyr, supra. Accordingly, the respondent’s reliance upon United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, 568 F.3d 1139 (9th Cir. 2009), is misplaced and given the respondent’s circumstances and the state of the law in 1998, we do not agree with the respondent’s assertion that the Immigration Judge should have advised the respondent that he might be eligible for section 212(c) relief. Valencia v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 1261 (9th Cir. 2008) (alien lacking apparent eligibility for relief from removal did not have due process right to notice of such relief).
 
*2 The record also does not support the respondent’s claim that his appeal waiver was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. The record contains a bi-lingual “Request for Prompt Removal,” signed by the respondent. The respondent agreed that he would waive appeal of the decision ordering his removal, he would accept the order of removal as final, and that he entered the request “voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.”
 
The respondent has not established that he exercised due diligence in discovering essential information bearing on his claim. The record reflects that although the respondent’s wife contacted attorneys in 1998, 2008, and 2009, there is no evidence to indicate that the respondent or his wife took any actions to resolve the respondent’s immigration status between 1999 and 2007 (see Declarations of Ricardo Perez-Morales and Christina Perez in Support of Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Indictment). Valeriano v. Gonzales, supra, at 673 (for equitable tolling to apply, it is necessary that despite all due diligence, the party invoking equitable tolling is unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of the claim, and the party’s ignorance of the necessary information must have been caused by circumstances beyond the party’s control).
 
The respondent did not file his motion to reopen until November 2009, which is 8 years after the publication of INS v. St. Cyr, 4 years after the statutory deadline for filing a special motion pursuant to 8 C.F.R § 1003.44(h), and 2 years after the publication of Reynoso-Cisneros v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1001, 1002 (9th Cir. 2007) (Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 19-20). See also Lin v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 979 (9th Cir.2007) (regulation did not preclude jurisdiction over motion to reopen filed by alien who had been lawfully removed after the completion of immigration proceedings).
 
In addition, the record does not contain objective and reliable evidence to establish that the respondent pled guilty in 1994 to possession of cocaine base for sale, nor has the respondent demonstrated that he relied on section 212(c) relief at the time of his 1994 conviction. Thus, there is no basis to disturb the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is not eligible for a 212(c) waiver or any other relief, and the respondent has failed to show a due process violation.
 
The record reflects that the respondent illegally reentered the United States on multiple occasions. Therefore, he is ineligible for reopening pursuant to 8 C.F.R. 1003.44(k)(2). Avila-Sanchez v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir. 2007) (provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(k)(2) are constitutional). Consistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St. Cyr, supra, and the section 212(c) regulation found at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(a), the respondent is precluded from establishing his eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act. Given that the respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for the relief sought, reopening is not warranted. Matter of Gutierrez, 21 I&N Dec. 479, 482 (BIA 1996). In view of the foregoing, the following order shall be entered.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rashmi N. Patel, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Israel, moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) to reopen proceedings in which we issued our final order on August 13, 2009. We dismissed the appeal of the February 12, 2008, Immigration Judge order denying a continuance and voluntary departure. The motion requests reopening to apply for adjustment of status. However, as noted during the Immigration Judge hearing and in our decision on appeal, the petition filed by the respondent’s spouse was denied by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). In the instant motion, the respondent now argues that the attorney who represented him during the hearing, Sharyn D’Urso, provided ineffective assistance in not filing an appeal with the USCIS. However, the motion does not contain the information that might have warranted an appeal with the USCIS. No evidence of the bona fides of the respondent’s marriage has been provided aside from a self serving affidavit from the respondent (Motion at Tab A).
 
Furthermore, insofar as the motion argues that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance, the motion also fails to comply with the procedural requirements to establish such a claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). There is a letter to the prior attorney, but no complaint has been filed with the bar authority (see Motion at Tab B). The only explanation for failing to file the bar complaint is that the respondent feared there would be a negative impact on the immigration case. But as the respondent is now represented by current counsel, who also represented him during the immigration appeal process, this explanation is dubious. The respondent has not established that he suffered prejudice as the result of any ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000). The respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for relief warranting reopening. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay is denied as moot.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

Robert F. Peck
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s April 29, 2008, decision denying her motion to reopen. Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen sought reconsideration of her application for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) based upon newly proffered evidence. In order to succeed on a motion to reopen, “the applicant must show that the ¿ profferedº evidence could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” Bhasin v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 977, 984 (9th Cir. 2005); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent has not made such a showing.
 
The respondent maintains, however, that ineffective assistance of prior counsel is to blame for her failure to submit such evidence during her former hearing. In support of her claim, she submitted an affidavit in which prior counsel admits that he had not properly prepared the respondent’s TPS application. Even if the respondent is deemed to have satisfied the procedural requirements for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, see Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 937-39 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), the respondent’s motion was properly denied. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the newly proffered evidence would not alter the determination that the respondent had failed to establish her own — as opposed to her family members’ — continuous residence and physical presence in the United States as of, respectively, February 13, 2001, and March 9, 2001. See Matter of Barrientos, 24 I&N Dec. 100 n. 1 (BIA 2007).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Marvin J. Muller III
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Pakistan, appeals the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance and order of removal, and requests that the record be remanded. She claims that her former attorney was ineffective in that he did not assist her in pursuing an application for cancellation of removal. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2009). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent contends that she meets the statutory requirements for cancellation of removal for nonpermanent residents, in that she has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of over 10 years, has been a person of good moral character during that period, and can establish that her removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to her United States citizen mother (Respondent’s Br. at 1). See section 240A(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). She asserts that her prior attorney did not raise the possibility of this form of relief, and when she brought it up, he told her that she had no qualifying relatives and was not eligible. Instead, the attorney pursued a strategy of last resort, requesting continuances until the respondent’s priority date for adjustment of status through her mother became current, or until her husband’s Petition for Alien Worker (Form I-140) was approved (Respondent’s Br. at 8). The Immigration Judge denied the attorney’s last request for a continuance.
 
The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements for claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741 (4th Cir. 2006). Furthermore, we agree with the respondent that she was prejudiced by the actions of her former attorney, Mr. Nielsen. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 560 (BIA 2003). In his response to the respondent’s ethics complaint, Mr. Nielsen acknowledges that he did not file an application for cancellation of removal on the respondent’s behalf, and counseled her against it. Even if he genuinely believed that the respondent would not ultimately prevail on such an application, he did not inform her, or the Immigration Court (Tr. at 13), that her mother was a qualifying relative, and he did not adequately discuss with her the strengths and weaknesses of her case. Moreover, Mr. Nielsen admits that he considered the effect of statements she would make in support of her application on her husband’s eligibility for adjustment of status. Thus, his representation of both the respondent and her husband in these circumstances resulted in a conflict of interest that adversely affected the respondent. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: See. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Relief
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic and a lawful permanent resident of the United States since his admission as an immigrant on or about November 8, 1980, has filed a timely appeal from an Immigration Judge’s February 9, 2010, decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2010); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2010), Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
Upon our de novo review of the issues presented here, we have concluded that the respondent presents no arguments on appeal that would cause us to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision. Based on the record before us, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is subject to removal from the United States based on the respondent’s admissions in this case (Tr. at 10), record of convictions (Group Exh. 2), and concession of removability (Tr. at 10). See section 240(c)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A). Moreover, the respondent has failed to establish his eligibility for any relief from removal, including cancellation of removal¿FN1º under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). See also section 240(c)(4)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d).
 
Finally, we consider that accompanying the appeal, the respondent seeks a remand in order to apply for waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). The requirements for a motion to remand are essentially the same as the requirements for a motion to reopen. Rodriguez v. INS, 841 F.2d 865 (9th Cir. 1987). Specifically, “¿aº motion to reopen ¿or remandº proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). However, the information concerning the health issues affecting his wife and daughter were disclosed by the respondent at the hearing before the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 17). Furthermore, in response to the question posed by the Immigration Judge as to what relief from removal he was seeking, the respondent, through his attorney, stated that “it does not appear that ¿the respondentº is eligible for ¿anyº relief at this point” (Tr. at 11). In addition, the motion must be supported by affidavits, applications for relief and any supporting documentation in order to establish prima facie eligibility for the requested relief upon reopening. Id.
 
*2 Furthermore, to the extent that the respondent may have been prevented from pursuing an application for a section 212(h) waiver by the actions of former counsel, the respondent has not raised the issue of ineffective assistance of former counsel, or complied with the Board’s decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 851 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (setting out the requirements that would support a motion to reopen based on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel). Consequently, as the respondent has not demonstrated that a remand is warranted, the motion to remand will be denied.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
pORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion for a remand is denied.

In this regard we consider that as the respondent was previously granted a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), by another Immigration Judge on November 8, 2002, in prior deportation proceedings, the respondent is statutorily precluded by section 240A(c)(6) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(c)(6), from pursuing an application for cancellation of removal for lawful permanent residents.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Devin Theriot-Orr, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert F. Peck
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)º - Convicted of crime involving moral turpitude
 
Lodged: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen his removal proceedings. In our decision dated December 5, 2008, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision which found him removable as charged above and denied his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) ¿1994º. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the respondent’s motion.¿FN1º The motion will be granted.
  
I. JURISDICTION
 
On February 16, 2000, an Immigration Judge issued an in absentia removal order in the respondent’s case. On May 10, 2000, DHS removed the respondent from the United States. On February 25, 2005, an Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s motion to reopen. We find that the Immigration Judge properly found that he had jurisdiction over the respondent’s motion to rescind the in absentia removal order even though he had been removed from the United States on May 10, 2000. See Matter of Armendarez, 24 I&N Dec. 646, 654 n.6 (BIA 2008) (noting that we were referring to motions to reopen other than those seeking rescission of in absentia removal orders; we expressed no opinion on whether an alien’s departure would foreclose the filing of a rescission motion, as rescission can be viewed as vacating the in absentia removal order from the outset). We thus find that we have jurisdiction over the respondent’s present motion to reopen even though he was removed from the United States in 2000.
  
II.. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL CLAIM
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen (filed on December 8, 2009) is untimely. The respondent alleges ineffective assistance of former counsels (Adolfo Ojeda-Casimiro and Amanda Stevens). In Matter of Compean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General directed the Board to continue to apply the previously established standards for reviewing motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel (pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
  
A. The Lozada requirements
 
*2 The respondent shows substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to allege ineffective assistance of Mr. Ojeda-Casimiro and Ms. Stevens. The respondent presents his declaration and the declarations of Mr. Ojeda-Casimiro and Ms. Stevens. We find that the respondent’s failure to file complaints against Mr. Ojeda-Casimiro and Ms. Stevens with appropriate disciplinary authorities is not fatal to his claim under the circumstances presented (as discussed below). See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525-26 (9th Cir. 2000) (the failure to comply with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, is not fatal where the alleged ineffective assistance is plain on the face of the administrative record).
  
B. Prejudice
 
The respondent shows prejudice. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793 (9th Cir. 2005) (the alien must generally show that she was prejudiced by her counsel’s performance).
  
1. Aggravated Felony Charge
 
Mr. Ojeda-Casimiro conceded that the respondent (a lawful permanent resident) was convicted of an aggravated felony in the motion to change venue and again at the July 26, 2005, hearing (Tr. at 2-3). Prior to filing a motion to reconsider on January 5, 2009, Ms. Stevens did not advise the respondent to file a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of Mr. Ojedo-Casimiro or to timely file a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The respondent was convicted of assault in the fourth degree in an Oregon criminal court on November 6, 1995 (Exh. 3). Although not a model of clarity, the conviction record shows “Susp. Imposition¿,º” or imposition of sentence suspended. The conviction record also shows “18 months Formal ¿,º” or 18 months formal probation given. Because the respondent was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least 1 year, the conviction is not an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F). The respondent is thus eligible to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a).
  
2. Crime Involving Moral Turpitude Charges
 
Mr. Ojeda-Casimiro also conceded the two crimes involving moral turpitude charges. The respondent shows prejudice on the charge under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i). In Oregon, assault in the fourth degree is a Class A misdemeanor, and is punishable by a maximum of 1 year in prison. See sections 163.160 (assault in the fourth degree) and 161.615 (prison terms for misdemeanors) of the Oregon Revised Statutes (1995). Because a sentence of 1 year or longer could not be imposed, the conviction is not a deportable offense under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act. The respondent also shows prejudice on the charge under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act. The conviction fits into the petty offense exception of section 212(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II) of the Act. The maximum penalty possible did not exceed imprisonment for 1 year, and the respondent was not sentenced to any term of imprisonment.
  
C. Due Diligence
 
*3 The respondent shows due diligence. See Ghahremani v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 993, 999-1000 (9th Cir. 2007) (the limitations period is tolled until the alien definitively learns of counsel’s ineffective assistance). The respondent first learned of both former counsels’ ineffective assistance when he met with present counsel on September 28, 2009. See Motion Exh. A at 3. The motion to reopen was filed on December 8, 2009, within 90 days thereafter. We find equitable tolling of the time limit on the motion to reopen is warranted.
 
We will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent shows substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, shows prejudice, and shows due diligence. We will remand to allow the respondent to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act.¿FN2º Relief from removal is still relevant because the respondent remains removable on the charge under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act (present without being admitted or paroled).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN RE: GUSTAVO MIRANDA-GONZALEZ
File: AXXX XX8 434 - San Francisco, CA
April 8, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Daniela R. Razawi, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Justin M. Price
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order in these proceedings on May 25, 2005, when we affirmed a November 17, 2004, decision in which the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion for a continuance, found him removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, and ordered his removal from the United States. On April 2, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied the respondent’s petition for review of the Board’s decision.¿FN1º See Miranda-Gonzalez v. Holder, 320 Fed. Appx. 807 (9th Cir. 2009). On January 6, 2010, the respondent filed this untimely motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent raises his ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Charles Victor Stebley, Esquire, the attorney who represented him during the removal hearing and on appeal, and who filed the petition for judicial review. The respondent alleges that Attorney Stebley failed to file a written motion with the Immigration Judge to continue the hearing while the respondent pursued a collateral attack on the conviction underlying the charge of removal. See Motion to Reopen at 3.
 
The filing deadline imposed on motions to reopen may be equitably tolled during periods when an alien is prevented from filing because of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. I.N.S., 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). However, the alien must establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of counsel’s ineffective assistance, and that he exercised due diligence in discovering the ineffective assistance. Id. at 897-98. The respondent has failed to meet this burden.
 
Initially, we do not find that the respondent has shown that he suffered prejudice as a result of Attorney Stebley’s handling of his case. Id. The respondent has not identified any form of relief from removal for which he may qualify. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1988) (explaining that a party who seeks a remand or to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case). Nor has he offered evidence that the conviction underlying the charge of removability has been vacated.¿FN2º As such, the respondent has failed to show that he suffered prejudice as a result of any ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. I.N.S., supra, at 899-900.
 
*2 Secondly, and separately, we are not persuaded that the respondent has adequately shown that he exercised due diligence in this matter. The instant motion to reopen was brought before the Board nearly four years after our May 25, 2005, decision. The respondent states that Attorney Stebley mislead him up to the time that he picked up his file on December 19, 2009, for present counsel to review. However, present counsel entered her notice of appearance on the respondent’s before the Ninth Circuit on May 26, 2006, in conjunction with the petition for review of these very proceedings. The respondent raises no claim regarding present counsel and we do not find any adequate explanation for her apparent failure to raise the issue of ineffective representation with her client years ago. The issue of the Immigration Judge’s denial of the continuance, the adequacy of the evidence of removability, and due process concerns were matters raised before the Ninth Circuit. On this record, we not find that the respondent has exercised due diligence in delaying the filing the present motion with the Board until the denial of his petition for review.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied. The related request for a stay of removal pending the disposition of this motion is denied as moot.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ehab Moustafa, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º- In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Egypt, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 4, 2009, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings that were conducted in absentia on January 24, 2006. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings that were conducted in absentia. Specifically, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent did not demonstrate that the in absentia order of removal qualifies for rescission. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); see also section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Nor do we find clear error in the factual findings leading up to that determination. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, an order issued following proceedings conducted in absentia may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed (a) within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that he failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, or (b) at any time if the alien demonstrates he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own.
 
The respondent on appeal does not assert either that he was unaware of or that he did not receive proper notice of his January 24, 2006, hearing that was scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. Instead, the respondent apparently asserts that his failure to timely file a motion alleging exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear is the result of the ineffective assistance of his former attorneys.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely as it was filed well after 180 days, 3 years, after the date of the order of removal and, in any event, establishes no exceptional circumstances that would excuse the respondent’s failure to appear. Moreover, we reject the respondent’s apparent ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Significantly, the respondent on appeal did not submit an affidavit averring to his attorney’s assertion that the respondent’s former attorneys caused or contributed to the delay in filing a motion to reopen. See, e.g., Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (recognizing that statements made by counsel are not evidence). Notably, the respondent’s brief on appeal indicates that the first attorney informed the respondent of the need to file a motion to reopen within a certain time period (Respondent’s brief at 1). In addition, the respondent has not indicated when, after learning about the need to file a motion to reopen, he first contacted the second attorney (although he apparently did not actually hire that attorney until February 2008).
 
*2 We do not find that the respondent’s current attorney’s assertion relating to the ineffectiveness of the respondent’s former attorneys is alone sufficient to demonstrate patent error. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Nor, has the respondent sufficiently complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). Therefore, on this record, and on the facts as found by the Immigration Judge, we decline to set aside the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
Finally, even if the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3) were applicable, the respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was filed well over 90 days, 3 years, after the Immigration Judge’s 2006 order of removal. The respondent has not identified any changed circumstances in Egypt that would have excepted his untimely motion from the applicable time limitations. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Moreover, the “new” evidence relating to the respondent’s approved visa petition does not pertain to any claim of a material change in country conditions in his native Egypt since the Immigration Judge’s decision. Thus, the respondent has failed to show that his motion to reopen falls within an exception to the general time limits. See section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). As a result, the respondent is precluded from seeking reopening to apply for adjustment of status.
 
On the whole, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s resolution. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: KATARZYNA MARTA PAWLIK
File: AXXX XX2 881 - Chicago, IL
April 1, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David Butbul, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
David M. Williams
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º- In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Poland, appeals an Immigration Judge’s March 13, 2008, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. We review the Immigration Judge’s factual findings for clear error and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by denying the respondent’s motion to reopen because the respondent was not aware that she was requesting voluntary departure at her December 18, 2007, hearing. See Respondent’s Brief at 1-2. We disagree.
 
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1), to obtain reopening, the respondent must show that the evidence she seeks to admit is material, previously unavailable and could not have been discovered or presented at her previous hearing. The respondent has not met this burden. In her motion to reopen, the respondent argued that she believed that, because she received a fingerprint notice dated April 26, 2007, she would be allowed to remain in the United States. See Motion to Reopen at 1-2. Despite this argument, however, the notice was issued eight months prior to her hearing on December 18, 2007, at which the respondent requested voluntary departure. See Attachment to Motion to Reopen. Also, at her hearing, the respondent’s then-attorney clearly requested voluntary departure. Although the record is unclear as to whether the Immigration Judge was accurate in indicating that the respondent’s former counsel consulted with her about the voluntary departure request during the hearing (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 9-12), the fact remains that the respondent has not contended that her former counsel rendered ineffective assistance; nor has she complied with the legal requirements for such a contention. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board to apply the Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
Moreover, the respondent’s former attorney was previously given a seven-month continuance to prepare the respondent’s case (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 1-2). Despite this continuance, the only relief that the respondent’s former attorney requested at her subsequent hearing was a period of voluntary departure “to the maximum extent the Court can grant her” (Tr. at 9). The Immigration Judge did require the respondent to waive all appeal rights as a condition to receiving the maximum 120-day period for voluntary departure, but such a requirement exists as a matter of law. See Matter of Ocampo-Ugalde, 22 I&N Dec. 1301 (BIA 2000). Further, although the respondent’s former counsel initially contested the legal validity of the Notice to Appear, he (and thus the respondent) ultimately abandoned his challenges when — after the Immigration Judge accepted an amendment to the Notice to Appear but otherwise ruled against the legal challenges — counsel conceded removability and waived appeal in order to receive the maximum voluntary departure period. Given these facts, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
*2 Finally, we note that all motions to reopen based on an application for relief “must be accompanied by the appropriate application.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Here, despite requesting reopening, the respondent does not allege that she is eligible for any relief from removal. See Respondent’s Brief at 2; Notice of Appeal. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated that she suffered prejudice from the Immigration Judge’s alleged error. See Eke v. Mukasey, 512 F.3d 372, 383 (7th Cir. 2008). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

On January 28, 2010, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider the Board’s January 8, 2010, decision finding him removable as charged. He filed a second motion to reconsider on February 4, 2010, and filed a motion to reopen on March 8, 2010. The respondent also submitted an opposition to one of the Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) submissions which we construe as a second motion to reopen, filed March 19, 2010. The record will be remanded.
 
In his various motions the respondent argues that his conviction for indecent behavior with a juvenile in violation of Louisiana Revised Statutes § 14:81 was not an aggravated felony. He argues that the statute is divisible, and it is unclear under what section of the statute he was convicted. As such, he maintains that the record cannot support a finding that he was convicted of an aggravated felony. The respondent also essentially contends that his former attorney provided him with ineffective assistance by erroneously advising him that his noted conviction constituted an aggravated felony, and in advising him to concede removability. In addition, he avers that he is not subject to removal as he is a national of the United States.
 
We initially find no merit to the respondent’s argument that he is a national of the United States because he served in the United States military, at which time he pledged an oath of allegiance to the United States (3/8/10 Motion at 1). Contrary to the respondent’s arguments otherwise, service in the armed forces of the United States and the taking of the standard military oath does not make a person a national of this country. See Warmington v. Keisler, 254 Fed. Appx. 287, 289 (5th Cir. 2007), citing Reyes-Alcaraz v. Ashcroft, 363 F.3d 937, 938-40 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that service in the armed forces of the United States, along with the taking of the standard military oath, does not alter an alien’s status to that of a “national” within the meaning of the Act); see also Omolo v. Gonzales, 452 F.3d 404, 409 (5th Cir. 2006) (finding that “a person may become a national only by birth or by completing the naturalization process”).
 
With the respondent’s February 4, 2010, motion he submitted evidence that he sent a letter to former counsel advising her of his intent to pursue a claim of ineffective assistance against her.¿FN1º In his March 19, 2010, response to a DHS submission, the respondent reported that he had complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, appending a copy of an affidavit from himself, and a bar complaint he reportedly filed against former counsel. As with another submission, these submissions and associated arguments constitute a motion to reopen. Id.
 
*2 This Board is cognizant of the number limitations on motions to reconsider and reopen. Therefore, to resolve any ambiguity in this regard, we shall accept the entirety of the respondent’s submissions sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). We find that the respondent has substantially satisfied the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000). As a result of counsel’s concession to the charge of removability, the respondent was precluded from presenting any argument in this regard. Such action served to prejudice the respondent. See De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 884 (5th Cir. 2004) (requiring a showing of prejudice for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
In light of the record before us, and affording the respondent every benefit of the doubt, we find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. On remand, the respondent should be allowed an opportunity to contest the charge of removability. Therefore, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vinh C. Trieu, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carmen A. Leal
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Remand; 212(c) waiver
 
This case was last before us on March 26, 2007, when we granted the respondent’s unopposed motion to reopen, and remanded the record to the Immigration Court for further proceedings. On June 3, 2008, the Immigration Judge issued a new decision denying the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (repealed 1996), and ordering the respondent removed to Pakistan. The respondent has now appealed this decision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has requested that the Immigration Judge’s decision be affirmed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met their relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii); see also Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent first argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in refusing new counsel’s request to amend the pleadings in remanded proceedings after the Board granted the respondent’s motion to reopen his case based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent further argues that his theft offense conviction under section 31.03 of the Texas Penal Code was divisible, and that the DHS did not meet its burden of establishing that the respondent was convicted of the portion of the statute which qualified his offense as an aggravated felony.
 
We initially note that the respondent on appeal has mischaracterized the Board’s March 26, 2007, decision granting his unopposed motion to reopen. Contrary to the respondent’s assertions, the Board made no explicit or implicit “determination that previous counsel was ineffective,” and further, that it should then be “assume¿dº that any pleading taken during previous proceedings was without the advice of effective counsel at that time” (see Respondent’s Br. at 3, 9). There was nothing in the Board’s March 26, 2007, decision which required the Immigration Judge to allow him to change his pleadings simply because new counsel would “like to deny some of the allegations” (Tr. at 3-11). See, e.g., Hoodho v. Holder, 558 F.3d 184, 187 (2d Cir. 2009) (“A petitioner cannot disavow that concession because, in hindsight, it might have been preferable for him to have contested removability, rather than to have conceded it.”).
 
*2 The respondent did not clearly articulate an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as it related to his pleadings in his motion to the Board (his motion alleges only ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to file a 212(c) waiver application) or before the Immigration Judge at his remanded proceedings (Tr. at 3-11; see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen). The respondent’s arguments regarding the alleged error in prior counsel’s concessions he now raises on appeal were not brought before the Immigration Judge, and we further note that the respondent has not filed an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as it relates to counsel’s judicial admissions under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The distinct and formal concession of removability, made by the respondent’s attorney acting in his professional capacity and in the respondent’s presence during the removal hearing, is binding on the respondent as a judicial admission. The respondent in the instant case has not established that circumstances exist that would permit the withdrawal of his prior judicial admissions. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made as a tactical decision by an attorney in a deportation proceeding is binding on his alien client); cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(B) (authorizing summary dismissal of appeals when “¿tºhe only reason for the appeal specified by the party concerned involves a finding of fact or a conclusion of law that was conceded by that party at a prior proceeding”); see generally Pool Co. v. Cooper, 274 F.3d 173, 185 (5th Cir. 2001) (finding that the court was entitled to treat a concession as a binding judicial admission of fact.); Martinez v. Bally’s Louisiana, Inc., 244 F.3d 474 (5th Cir 2001) (a judicial admission is conclusive, unless the court allows it to be withdrawn). Accordingly, we will dismiss the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s determination that he is removable as charged on the Notice to Appear (NTA).
 
Moreover, even if we were to consider arguendo the respondent’s contentions on appeal challenging his removability, we find his arguments to be unavailing. The record includes undisputed evidence showing that the respondent was convicted of tampering with government records in the third degree in 1989, and of theft in the third degree in 1992, in violation of Texas law (Gr. Exh. 6A). We note that the respondent on appeal has not challenged his deportability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, and he thus remains removable under this charge.
 
With regard to the charge of removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, the respondent has argued that section 31.03 of the Texas Penal Code, the statute under which he was convicted, is a divisible statute. Specifically, he has argued that the statute does not “necessarily” require “an intent to deprive the owner of his property” (Respondent’s Br. at 8-9). This assertion, however, is contravened by a plain reading of section 31.03 of the Texas Penal Code, which provides, in relevant part, that a person commits a theft offense “if he unlawfully appropriates property with intent to deprive the owner of property.” Section 31.03(a) of the Texas Penal Code (emphasis added). Accordingly, “intent to deprive the owner of property” is an essential element of theft under Texas law. Moreover, even if the respondent was convicted under a divisible statute, his record of conviction establishes that his conviction was an aggravated felony as described in section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act¿FN1º under the modified categorical approach.
 
*3 The record of conviction shows that the respondent in 1992 entered a plea of nolo contendre to “¿tºheft (sting operation), with intent to deprive the owner,” and the indictment charged the respondent, “with intent to deprive the owner…of the property…¿to wit: 90 carton of cigarettesº and believing said property was stolen by another, appropriate, by acquiring and otherwise exercising control over said property” (Exh. 6A). The respondent was sentenced to 2 years of imprisonment for this crime (id.). In Matter of Cardiel-Guerrero, 25 I&N Dec. 12 (BIA 2009) and Matter of Bahta, 22 I&N Dec. 1381 (BIA 2000), the Board held that the generic and contemporary meaning of “receipt of stolen property” described in section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act prohibits the concealing, selling, or withholding of stolen or extorted property, or aiding in same, knowing it to have been so stolen or obtained. The Texas theft offense for which the respondent was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding 1 year, falls within the generic definition of “receipt of stolen property” relied upon by the Board in its precedent decisions, and constitutes an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act. Accordingly, the respondent also remains removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.
 
Turning to the respondent’s application for relief from removal, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent cannot obtain a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act because there is no comparable ground of inadmissibility to section 101(a)(43(G) of the Act, the category that underpins his aggravated felony charge under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act. See Matter of Brieva-Perez, 23 I&N Dec. 766, 771 (BIA 2005), pet’n for review denied by Brieva v. Gonzales, 482 F.3d 356 (5th Cir. 2007); Matter of Blake, 23 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 2005); see also 8 C.F.R. 1212.3(f)(5). The test for determining whether a ground of removability has a statutory counterpart in section 212(a) of the Act “turns on whether Congress has employed similar language to describe substantially equivalent categories of offenses.” Matter of Brieva-Perez, supra, at 771, citing Matter of Blake, supra. No provision in section 212(a) of the Act establishes inadmissibility for theft or “receipt of stolen property” or any comparable category of offenses. We recognize that a theft offense is ordinarily a crime involving moral turpitude and thus a conviction therefor will render an alien inadmissible under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act. Nonetheless, that fact does not establish comparability under the standard announced in Matter of Brieva-Perez, supra, and Matter of Blake, supra. The wide range of offenses that fall within the scope of section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act simply does not compare in any way that can be described as substantially equivalent to the narrow category of theft offenses specified in section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act. Cf. Matter of Brieva, 23 I&N Dec. 766 (BIA 2005) (holding that section 212(a) of the Act does not contain a ground of inadmissibility that corresponds to the crime or violence ground of removability). Thus, we conclude that section 212(a) of the Act does not contain a ground of inadmissibility that is comparable to the grounds upon which the respondent is removable. Accordingly, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to pretermit the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c).
 
*4 Finally, the respondent claims that the Immigration Judge erred in “fail¿ingº to consider other forms of relief respondent may assert to avoid removal,” and that he intends to apply for benefits under section 244 of the Act, as the spouse of a temporary protected status beneficiary (Respondent’s Br. at 14). We note, however, that the respondent was asked by the Immigration Judge what relief from removal he wanted to pursue, and he never stated he had any intention to file an application for benefits under section 244 of the Act (Tr. at 11-12, 30). The respondent on appeal has not otherwise submitted an application for relief from removal, or presented new evidence establishing his prima facie eligibility for derivative temporary protected status¿FN2º or any other relief from removal that may have justified remanding his case for further proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 14). See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (a motion to remand may be denied where a prima facie case for the relief sought has not been established, or in the absence of previously unavailable, material evidence).
 
In view of the foregoing, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: GABRIEL FELIX-FERNANDEZ
File: AXXX XX8 975 - San Diego, CA
March 30, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robin Chandler Carr, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
J.L. Woodmansee
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 We entered the final administrative order in this case on March 29, 2006, and denied a subsequent motion to reopen in 2007. On October 8, 2009, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorney who represented him at his initial hearings before the Immigration Judge. Alternatively, the respondent requests that we reconsider his case in light of the decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in de Rodriquez -Echeverria v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 1047 (9th Cir. 2008). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s excuse for failing to comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (requiring a showing of prejudice in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel). Although prior counsel no longer practiced at the location where his office was previously located, the respondent has not explained what reasonable steps were taken to determine if he was still practicing law, and where.
 
In any event, the respondent has not shown that he exercised due diligence in pursuing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against Robert B. Schneider, Esquire. Although it is not specifically referenced in the motion, the respondent’s current counsel, Ms. Carr, represented the respondent at his final hearing before the Immigration Judge in 2005, on appeal to the Board (when she received a full copy of the transcript), and on his first motion to reopen in 2007. If the respondent felt that Mr. Schneider’s strategy and efforts at the initial hearings in the immigration court constituted ineffective assistance, such a claim could have been pursued years ago. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003)(holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). See also Ghahremani v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 993 (9th Cir. 2007)(a demonstration of “unbroken efforts to retain competent counsel and file a motion to reopen” is necessary to establish due diligence warranting equitable tolling). Accordingly, the motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel will be denied as untimely and number-barred.
 
*2 The respondent’s alternative argument also fails. De Rodriquez - Echeverria v. Mukasey, supra, does not represent a fundamental change in law. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999) (emphasizing the importance of administrative finality and finding that the Board will exercise sua sponte authority to reconsider a case under new law only when the change in law is fundamental in nature and not merely an incremental development in the state of the law). In De Rodriquez -Echeverria the court remanded the case to us to address, in the first instance, whether 8 C.F.R. § 287.3(c) was violated and the statements were voluntary in the circumstances of that case. Further, as the DHS points out in its opposition brief, the respondent has not addressed the Ninth Circuit’s subsequent decision in Samayoa-Martinez v. Holder, 558 F.3d 897, 901-02 (9th Cir. 2009), which was issued seven months before this motion was filed. In Samayoa-Martinez the court held that 8 C.F.R.§ 287.3(c) does not require that DHS advise an alien of a right to counsel until the alien is placed in formal proceedings by the filing of the Notice to Appeal in the immigration court. The court also noted that § 287.3(c) does not include any requirement that the alien be advised of a right to remain silent or a right against self-incrimination.¿FN1º Id. at n. 6. Accordingly, the respondent has not demonstrated a fundamental change in law that impacts the result in this case and the motion to reconsider based on De Rodriquez-Echeverria v. Mukasey, supra, will also be denied as untimely.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose M. Guerrero, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jane H. Thomson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of South Africa, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s August 7, 2008, denial of her motion to reopen her deportation proceedings. During those proceedings, she was granted voluntary departure. The respondent withdrew her request for voluntary departure and requested reopening to pursue her pending application for adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility made by the Immigration Judge, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2009). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008).
 
In her motion to reopen, the respondent claimed that her prior counsel was ineffective in that he did not pursue the respondent’s pending application for adjustment of status as a stepchild of a United States citizen. The Immigration Judge found that the motion was untimely. He further concluded that the appellant had not complied with the requirements for claiming ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
On appeal, the respondent makes no argument concerning the untimeliness of her motion to reopen, and we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the motion to reopen was not timely filed by the respondent’s current attorney. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2)(motions to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of final administrative removal order).
 
We further agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. Specifically, she did not submit an affidavit from the respondent setting forth in detail the allegations against her former counsel, and she did not demonstrate that her former attorney had been informed of the allegations and had an opportunity to respond (I.J. at 3). Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639; see also Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497 (5th Cir. 2000) (upholding the general application of the Lozada rules). The fact that the respondent submitted a copy of the complaint against her former attorney is not sufficient (Respondent’s Br. at 2). First, the respondent submitted no proof of filing with, or receipt by, the State Bar of Texas. Second, the respondent’s statement in the complaint does not serve as an affidavit. Third, the respondent has submitted nothing to demonstrate that her former attorney received a copy of the complaint or any other information concerning her claim of ineffective assistance. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.¿FN1º

While we need not address whether the respondent has demonstrated sufficient prejudice in her claim of prior ineffective assistance, we note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has ruled that the failure to receive relief that is purely discretionary in nature does not amount to a deprivation of a constitutional liberty interest.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raul Villasuso, Jr., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Vanessa G. Pocock
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on September 17, 2009, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal alleging that the voluntary departure bond set by the Immigration Judge was excessive and found that the respondent’s due process rights had not been violated by the Immigration Judge’s denial of a motion to withdraw as counsel filed by his attorney. The respondent, a male native and citizen of Mexico, has filed a timely motion to reopen for consideration of cancellation of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen proceedings shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material and shall not be granted unless it appears that the evidence offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the alien establishes a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). The respondent also claims that reopening is warranted because he received ineffective assistance from his former attorney which resulted in the failure to file an application for cancellation of removal below.
 
The respondent acknowledges that he could have filed a cancellation application with supporting evidence for consideration at the 2008 hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). While the respondent has submitted an application for cancellation in support of this motion, he has not provided an affidavit or any other documentary evidence demonstrating prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal as required for reopening. See INS v. Abudu, supra. We further note that the respondent has complied with none of the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498, 501-02 (7th Cir. 2001).¿FN1º Under the circumstances, the respondent has not shown that reopening is warranted.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent was represented below and on appeal by Malcolm B. Gerber, Esquire. The respondent addressed an unsworn statement, dated October 16, 2009, to Calmec Global Law Group generally stating that he was never given an opportunity to present an application for relief from removal for adjudication. This statement is inadequate to satisfy the Lozada requirement that the respondent notify Mr. Gerber of the charges of ineffective assistance raised and to provide Mr. Gerber with the opportunity to respond. In addition, although the respondent has provided a copy of an document signed by both the respondent and Mr. Gerber, this document is primarily in Spanish and is inadequate to set forth the nature and scope of their agreement, as it is not accompanied by an English translation. The respondent has also completed a copy of a form requesting investigation of the Calmec Global Group rather than Mr. Gerber, and there is no showing that the form has been filed with the Illinois bar.

File: AXXX XX1 344 - Dallas, TX
March 26, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mark E. Jacobs, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated December 7, 2008, denying his motion to reopen to allow him to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The appeal will be sustained.
 
In a decision dated August 5, 2008, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had abandoned his application for cancellation of removal (Form EOIR 42B) due to his failure to file such application on or before the April 7, 2008, deadline set by the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 74). The respondent was ordered removed to Albania.
 
The respondent timely filed a motion to reopen demonstrating that the application and fee had been received by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) on January 28, 2008, and asserting that he believed his former attorney had filed the application with the Immigration Court. Although he had “fired” his attorney in late January 2008, he asserts that he believed his former attorney had done all that was necessary as far as filing his application with the Immigration Court. The respondent states that he was unaware of his former counsel’s filing of a motion to withdraw, which alleges that the respondent was informed of his obligation to file the Form EOIR-42B. He states that he only learned in June 2008 that his cancellation application had not been filed with the Immigration Court after he received his file from his former attorney, and he points out that he requested additional time to file said application in a motion filed with the Immigration Court on August 1, 2008.
 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposed reopening, and the Immigration Judge determined that reopening was not warranted. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had not complied with any of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Additionally, the respondent’s notarized verification stating that “on his oath … each and every statement contained ¿in the motion to reopenº is within my personal knowledge and is true and correct” was legally insufficient to prove any of the facts asserted in the motion.
 
The regulations provide that the Immigration Judge may set and extend time limits for the filing of applications and that an application shall be deemed waived if not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). In the instant case, the respondent admittedly missed the April 7, 2008, deadline set by the Immigration Judge for filing a Form EOIR-42B with the court.
 
*2 However, the facts set forth in the respondent’s motion, the truth of which he affirmed in a sworn statement, as well as errors contained in the former attorney’s motion to withdraw cast doubt on whether the respondent’s duty to file the EOIR-42B with the court was effectively communicated to him following his attorney’s withdrawal. The respondent’s former attorney indicated in his motion that such motion was delivered to the respondent. However, as pointed out by the respondent, the motion to withdraw identifies as his last known address an address in New Jersey, to which he had indicated in his motion to change venue he intended to move, rather than his address of record in Arlington, Texas.
 
Additionally, the motion lists an incorrect deadline for the filing of the Form EOIR-42B. See Immigration Court Practice Manual § 2.3(i)(ii)(attorney seeking withdrawal must provide evidence that he or she notified or attempted to notify the alien, with a recitation of specific efforts made, of pending deadlines, the necessity of meeting deadlines, and the consequences of failing to meet deadlines). Nor does it appear that a copy of the Immigration Judge’s order granting the motion to withdraw was sent to the respondent. Although the respondent, who attributes the failure to timely file to “miscommunication” rather than former counsel’s “ineffectiveness,” should have at least complied with the Lozada requirement of informing his former counsel of the allegations made against him, the errors contained in the motion to withdraw cast doubt on whether the respondent was informed by former counsel that he was expected to file the application with the court.
 
Additionally, it is apparent that the respondent did not intend to abandon his application, as the application and fee had already been sent to USCIS, and the respondent filed a motion several weeks before the scheduled hearing explaining the failure to timely file the application and requesting additional time to do so. The respondent has been in the United States for 17 years and has close family ties here. Under the circumstances, we find that proceedings should be reopened to give the respondent an opportunity to seek cancellation of removal. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Margis Matulionis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ted Y. Yamada
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), will be denied.¿FN1º
 
An Immigration Judge on December 17, 2003, denied the respondent’s motion to terminate and found the respondent subject to removal based on alien smuggling. The Board affirmed this decision without opinion on March 14, 2005. The respondent, who is from Mexico, filed a motion to reopen on January 28, 2010. The motion was filed many years out of time. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent broadly claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, but neither explains specifically how counsel failed him, nor complies with the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Additionally, reopening under the Board’s discretionary sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(a) is reserved for exceptional situations, which have not been demonstrated here. Matter of, J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); DHS Opp. The motion is, therefore, denied as untimely.

The respondent has been removed from the United States to Mexico. In Coyt v. Holder, 593 F.3d 902 (9th Cir. 2010), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Board may not find a motion withdrawn by operation of law, when the respondent is removed prior to the Board’s ruling on the motion. The motion is not, therefore, barred by reason of the respondent’s removal.

March 18, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Daniel W. Diaz, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 25, 2008. Based on admissions of the allegations of fact and concession of the charge of removability made in the Notice to Appear, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable for being present in the United States without admission or parole. The respondent requested no relief from removal. The respondent, through present counsel, requested an order of removal with the intention of requesting deferred action from the Department of Homeland Security. Consequently, the Immigration Judge entered an order of removal.
 
On appeal, the respondent’s present counsel argues that the respondent’s previous accredited representative made the admissions of allegations and concession of removability without the respondent’s authority. He also claims that the accredited representative misled counsel concerning whether pleadings had been taken. He alleges that this “foreclosed the respondent’s established legal strategy.”
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On review of the record, we find that the respondent was represented by an accredited representative after venue was changed to New York. Pleadings had not been taken prior to the change of venue. At the first hearing in New York, the accredited representative requested to have pleadings put over to prepare a suppression motion. The Immigration Judge granted the requested continuance. See Tr. at 18-23. At the next hearing, the accredited representative said he intended to request a deferred action in light of the fact that the respondent is suffering from end stage renal failure. At that hearing, the accredited representative admitted the factual allegations and conceded removability. The respondent was present at that hearing and at no time expressed any objection to either the planned request for deferred action or the admissions and concession made on his behalf. See Tr. at 25-27.
 
At the next hearing, substitute counsel Diaz appeared. He told the Immigration Judge that the respondent intended to take an order of removal and then request a deferred action. He said that no voluntary departure was requested but did request additional time before the entry of the order to enable him to prepare the packet of medical records needed for the deferred action request. That request was granted. See Tr. at 29. At the final hearing, counsel presented a suppression motion that was denied. See Tr. at 34. Counsel then requested the removal order be entered. See Tr. at 35.
 
*2 Present counsel is in effect alleging that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel from the prior accredited representative. However, the prerequisites for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel have not been fulfilled. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Moreover, the respondent has failed to identify how the admissions and concession negatively affected the outcome of the respondent’s case. The claimant must establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his accredited representative’s ineffectiveness. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, supra. This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Jiang v. Mukasey, 522 F.3d 266, 270 (2d Cir. 2008); Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
While present counsel says that the admissions of the allegations and concession of removability “foreclosed the respondent’s established legal strategy,” both present counsel and the former accredited representative indicated repeatedly that the legal strategy was to take an order of removal and request a deferred action. At the first hearing where he made an appearance, present counsel did not mention a suppression motion or ask whether pleadings had been taken. See Tr. at 29-31. We find that the prior accredited representative’s decision to admit the allegations or concede removability was a reasonable tactical decision and find no evidence in the record of egregious circumstance requiring the setting aside of the pleadings. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). In light of the fact that the respondent had no apparent relief from removal, and in light of the fact that the respondent is suffering from end stage renal failure, it was a reasonable tactical decision to request a removal order with the intention of requesting a deferred action. Consequently, the respondent has failed to show a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jorge De La Mar, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 This case has been before the Board on two prior occasions; April 27, 2009, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen in absentia proceedings, and July 30, 2009, when we denied her motion to reconsider our prior decision. On August 17, 2009, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen proceedings. The motion is denied.
 
With her motion the respondent has submitted a two-sentence statement from her counsel swearing that he “did not receive proper service of the next scheduled hearing date.” It appears from the record that this document was produced in response to an observation in our prior decision that such a statement was not of record. The motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 90-days after the Board’s April 2009 decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent also has not demonstrated that this statement was previously unavailable, and could not have been presented in conjunction with her original motion to reopen. We observe that the respondent has neither alleged that she had ineffective assistance of counsel in this regard, nor complied with any of the requirements for such a claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Given this record, we decline to exercise our discretionary authority to sua sponte reopen and remand proceedings for consideration of counsel’s statement. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(a), (c). We do not find that the piecemeal presentation of evidence in response to noted deficiencies in proof supports reopening of the proceedings. In addition, this document fails to overcome the fact, as noted in our prior decision, that the Immigration Judge’s decision reopening proceedings and the notice of hearing were not returned as undeliverable by the Postal Service. Therefore, we find that reopening is not warranted. Id.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Karla S. Baker
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on March 22, 2005, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings following an in absentia order of removal dated April 14, 2004. On July 28, 2009, the respondent flied a motion to reopen proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
With certain exceptions, an alien is entitled to file only one motion to reopen and the motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s current motion is a second motion to reopen and it was flied with the Board more than 5 years after the final administrative order of removal was entered.
 
The record establishes that neither the respondent, nor his counsel appeared at the respondent’s April 14, 2004, hearing. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia. A motion to reopen and a Notice of Appearance (Form EOIR-28) was filed with the Immigration Judge on June 16, 2004, by Attorney Patrick Tachie-Menson. The motion claimed that the respondent was ill on the day of the hearing, that he had terminated services with his prior attorney and had not yet retained Attorney Tachie-Menson, and that he did not know how to notify the Immigration Court about his illness. Attached to the motion was letter from a doctor dated May 18, 2004. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, and this Board affirmed that decision on March 22, 2005.
 
The respondent’s current motion to reopen was filed more than 4 years later. The respondent now claims that he had retained the services of an attorney, Lloyd Ukwu¿FN1º prior to his hearing, that Mr. Ukwu knew about the respondent’s back problems and said he would appear in Immigration Court on behalf of the respondent, that the attorney did not appear, and that the respondent only discovered this fact after he had been ordered removed in absentia. The respondent states that he received a document from the Immigration Court, took it to Mr. Ukwu for explanation, and was told he had been ordered deported and would have to file a motion to reopen. The respondent states that he was later visited by Mr. Ukwu and Mr. Tachie-Menson, and that he was told to write a letter, based on what was dictated to him, and to sign it. The respondent reports that on June 11, 2004, Mr. Ukwu contacted him again about an urgent need to come to his office, pick up a letter, and have it notarized. The respondent states that he did what he was told, even though he knew it was not in his best interest.
 
*2 The respondent reports that after the June 11, 2004, incident he never again heard from Mr. Ukwu. The respondent states that he called the attorney’s office and also visited there, but was told Mr. Ukwu was out of the country. Later, the respondent’s work permit expired and he sought advice from other attorneys. Based on this advise, the respondent filed a complaint against Mr. Ukwu with the District of Columbia Bar on February 22, 2007. On April 30, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, but it was rejected due to lack of jurisdiction. On July 28, 2009, the respondent filed the motion that is before us now. In his motion he claims that Mr. Ukwu provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent’s motion was filed many years after the final administrative order of removal and is untimely. Further, the respondent does not benefit from equitable tolling because he has not demonstrated, or even alleged, that he exercised due diligence in seeking reopening. See Chao v. Virginia Department of Transportation, 291 F.3d 276, 283 (4th Cir. 2002) (equitable tolling is not available when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf). The respondent was ordered removed on April 14, 2004. He last heard from Mr. Ukwu, the person he claims provided the ineffective assistance, in June 2004. He states that he knew that the documents filed with the Immigration Judge in June 2004, were not in his interest. He did not attempt to seek reopening until 2009. Notably, the respondent filed his complaint with the District of Columbia Bar at the beginning of 2007, more than 2 years before his motion to reopen was filed with the Board. The respondent provides no explanation for the significant delay. Thus, due diligence has not been established in this case, and equitable tolling does not apply.
 
Additionally, we agree with the DHS that the respondent has failed to submit a statement addressing the scope of his agreement with Mr. Ukwu, a requirement for ineffective assistance claims. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. He has also not made any ineffective assistance allegations against the attorney who was actually his attorney of record in the Immigration Court, Mr. Tachie-Menson. The respondent has not supported his motion with a signed or sworn statement, as required by Lozada, and he has also admitted to signing a statement, attached to his original motion, that contained false allegations.
 
For these reasons, the respondent’s untimely filed motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: ROSA MARY ABREU-PAEZ
File: AXXX XX9 019 - New York, NY
March 12, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose Alexis Rojas, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening, reconsideration
 
On April 25, 2008, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen her proceedings. And on May 16, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider the denial of the motion to reopen. The respondent has appealed from both decisions. The appeal will be dismissed.
  
I. BACKGROUND
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic. On appeal, she argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not reopening her proceeding. She claims that she has shown that she is eligible to adjust her status on the basis of a visa petition filed by her United States citizen husband and that she is prima facie eligible for adjustment under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i).
 
In addition, the respondent maintains that her failure to departure voluntarily or to file a timely motion was not willful. She argues that she did not depart because the extension of section 245(i) of the Act made her eligible for relief. And she claims that she did not file a timely motion to reopen because she was waiting for her priority date to become current or for her husband to become a United States citizen.
 
Finally, the respondent appears to allege that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. And she claims that she should not be prejudiced by her former attorneys’ failure to file motions to reopen.
  
II. ANALYSIS
 
As the Immigration Judge correctly noted, the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). And the respondent has not established that she is entitled to one of the exceptions to the time limits on motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4).
 
In addition, the respondent has not established that she is prima facie eligible for the relief she is seeking, despite her claims. See, e.g., Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996) (discussing proof required for reopening to seek newly available relief). The respondent is statutorily barred from obtaining adjustment of status for another year because she failed to depart voluntarily as required on or before February 5, 2001. See section 240B(d)(1)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d)(1)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(a). The respondent therefore is not entitled to reopening to pursue adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act even if she meets the other requirements for adjustment.
 
*2 The respondent claims on appeal that her failure to depart or to file a timely motion was not willful, but she has not established that her failure to depart was involuntary. Cf. Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87, 93-94 (BIA 2007).¿FN1º And there is no “exceptional circumstances” exception to section 240B(d)(1)(B) of the Act. Id. Moreover, the record shows that the respondent received the proper advisals regarding the consequences of failing to depart voluntarily. See Immigration Judge’s Decision dated October 6, 2000.
 
Finally, while the respondent appears to allege that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Immigration Judge correctly noted that the respondent has not met the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We therefore cannot conclude that the respondent is entitled to any remedy due to the possible conduct or misconduct of one of her attorneys. See Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Garcia-Martinez v. Department of Homeland Security, 448 F.3d 511, 513-14 (2d Cir. 2006) (indicating that an alien who fails to comply substantially with the Lozada requirements forfeits his or her ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
Based on the foregoing, we find that the Immigration Judge acted properly in denying both the respondent’s motion to reopen and her motion to reconsider the denial of her motion to reopen. We therefore uphold the Immigration Judge’s decisions and we dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent’s justification for filing her motion many years after the date upon which she was required to depart voluntarily also is not sufficient to justify sua sponte reopening. See, e.g., Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (indicating that sua sponte reopening is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or to circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sean Lewis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William A. Lund
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On August 28, 2009, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen these proceedings based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent asserts that his prior attorneys failed to inform him that he could file a motion to reopen these proceedings once his immediate relative visa petition was approved by the DHS’s United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. The respondent explains that he would have sought reopening to apply for voluntary departure, and would have voluntarily departed and applied for an immigrant visa in Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes reopening. The motion will be denied.
 
First, the respondent has not met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We do not find the respondent’s explanation for failing to comply with these requirements to be adequate. Further, the respondent has neither demonstrated that prior counsels’ representation was ineffective or that prejudice resulted from his former counsels’ performance. Id. The respondent is ineligible for adjustment of status under section 245(a) because he was not inspected and admitted into the United States, and he does not assert or establish that he is eligible for adjustment under section 245(i). Moreover, the respondent is ineligible for voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), because he was not physically present in the United States for a 1-year period immediately preceding the date the Notice to Appear was served (I.J. at 3; Exh. 1). Thus, the respondent has failed to establish that his prior attorneys’ conduct prejudiced his case. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: LIDIA LIRIANO LOPEZ
File: AXXX XX1 741 - Boston, MA
March 9, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ivan Crnilovic, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a female native and citizen of the Dominican Republic who has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision mailed on January 8, 2009. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia on March 4, 2008. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
Upon de novo review we find that the respondent has not established that proceedings should be reopened. The respondent claims in her motion to reopen that she and her former attorney of record, Paul A. Farina, Esquire, believed the hearing date was scheduled for March 18, 2008. The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent received proper notice since she and Mr. Farina attended a hearing on October 9, 2007, when Mr. Farina was provided with personal service of the hearing notice listing the correct date and time of the hearing. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (providing that whenever a person is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to the attorney or representative of record, or to the person himself if unrepresented). The respondent does not contest the Immigration Judge’s determination regarding a lack of notice, therefore this issue is waived.
 
We turn now to the respondent’s argument raised for the first time on appeal that her former attorney was ineffective for providing the respondent with the wrong hearing date. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and if the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A. G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”).
 
*2 The respondent has submitted a new affidavit on appeal stating that Mr. Farina told her the wrong hearing date. However, the respondent does not state that she informed Mr. Farina of the ineffective assistance claim that she has filed with the Board. Prior counsel has therefore been deprived of an opportunity to respond to the complaint before us. Thus, the Board is unable to consider the position of prior counsel to the allegations filed against him. Moreover, the respondent has failed to detail the agreement that was entered into with Mr. Farina with respect to the actions to be taken in this case and she does not state whether she has sought to file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities and if not, why not. We therefore find that the respondent has failed to establish exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear since she has failed to comply with Lozada. See Beltre-Veloz v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 2008) (finding that an alien’s affidavit that “makes no mention of the nature, scope, or substance of the ¿ alien’sº arrangement with ¿his attorneyº, ¿and fails toº indicate what communications the ¿alienº had with the attorney” contains a“fatal flaw” under the Lozada requirements).
 
The respondent also contends on appeal that her motion warrants reopening as a matter of discretion because she may qualify for cancellation of removal based upon her three United States citizen children or as a battered spouse. See section 240A(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). Attached to the respondent’s brief on appeal, she submitted documentation apparently related to a battered spouse claim. See 240A(b)(2)(A) of the Act. To the extent that the respondent seeks reopening and remand based upon this evidence, her speculation that she may seek relief does not warrant reopening sua sponte, nor does it support a remand to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of this issue. We therefore find no reason to disturb the decision of the Immigration Judge.
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: SEGUNDO FRANCISCO CAGUANA
File: AXXX XX9 479 - Buffalo, NY
March 5, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Shahla Khan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on January 16, 2007. On February 21, 2008, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s denial of a motion he filed seeking reopening of that decision. Therein we found the respondent had failed to overcome the presumption of proper delivery of his hearing notice, and did not demonstrate that reopening was appropriate. On July 29, 2009, the respondent submitted a second motion to reopen, now alleging that he received ineffective assistance from two former representatives, and asking that proceedings be reopened. The motion will be denied.
 
We initially observe that to the extent that the respondent avers that this Board erred in our prior decision with respect to the admission and consideration of a letter from Victor Salazar, these arguments are in the nature of a motion to reconsider (Motion at 5). See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). As it was filed more than 30 days after the Board’s decision, it is untimely, and we shall consider this aspect of his motion no further. Section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b).
 
The respondent now alleges that two persons whom he reportedly retained in the course of his proceedings provided him with ineffective assistance such that reopening is warranted. Specifically, he avers that following his release from DHS detention he met with and hired Victor Salazar of the Jackson Height Rafaelli Law Offices (Motion at 3-4). He states that Mr. Salazar falsely held himself out as an attorney, and advised the respondent to not attend his scheduled hearing as he would otherwise be deported from the United States, and did not inform him of the consequences of such action. He further contends that after he learned in April of 2007 of the removal order resulting from his failure to appear, he retained Jonathan Saint-Preux, Esquire, to file a motion to reopen, claiming that he failed to appear at his heating due to exceptional circumstances.¿FN1º However, he claims that Mr. Saint-Preux did not investigate the facts regarding a letter from Mr. Salazar which related to his claim of lack of knowledge of his hearing date or of Mr. Salazar’s direction that he not appear at his hearing, nor did he raise a claim of ineffective assistance against Mr. Salazar (Motion at 4). After Mr. Saint-Preux was suspended from practicing law, the respondent hired Cindy Paul, Esquire, to represent him on appeal before the Board, and subsequently hired current counsel to file a petition for review of the Board’s 2008 decision before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the petition was ultimately denied).
 
*2 In his motion the respondent also repeats his assertion that he never received personal service of his hearing notice (Motion at 3, 13 (ftnt. 7)). However, the Board previously considered this allegation and found no merit to the same. The respondent has raised no new factual allegations or legal arguments regarding the service of the hearing notice to the address he himself provided, and which he continues to assert was his address during the relevant time period. This issue has been fully litigated, including in a petition before the Second Circuit. Therefore, we decline to revisit these arguments, and shall address them no further.
 
The respondent essentially avers that Mr. Salazar falsely presented himself as an attorney and told him not to appear at his hearing as he would be deported, advising him to await the possibility of future relief. He also contends that Mr. Saint-Preux, whom he retained to reopen absentia proceedings, erred by not investigating the circumstances regarding a letter from the non-attorney sent to the Immigration Court, stating that the respondent could not be contacted, had relocated, and would not be appearing at his hearing. We recognize that the time and number bars on motions to reopen may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, so long as the movant has exercised “due diligence” in vindicating his rights. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 171 (2d Cir. 2006’).
 
We find that the respondent has not exercised due diligence in this regard. In conjunction with the 2007 motion to reopen filed by Mr. Saint-Preux, the respondent submitted a sworn affidavit which he signed under penalty of perjury. Therein the respondent stated that he was “unaware that ¿heº had a court ¿hearingº date” because his “previous attorney did not notify me that my presence was requested by the courts of Immigration.” These attestations are inconsistent with his new claim that he was, in fact, told of his hearing date by Mr. Salazar. He has not alleged that he informed Mr. Saint-Preux of Mr. Salazar’s purported actions, despite the fact that Mr. Salazar’s letter was submitted with the motion and referenced therein (2007 Motion at 2, attachment B). As such, we are not convinced that Mr. Saint-Preux committed cognizable error as alleged.¿FN2º
 
With the above-noted motion, the respondent also submitted a signed and sworn “Client Verification” stating that the attestations in the motion were true. Thus, by his own statements, the respondent was aware of the contents of his motion, and therefore knew that it failed to include any mention of the actions that he now alleges Mr. Salazar committed. Moreover, in our February 21, 2008, decision the Board noted that the respondent had failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against Mr. Salazar (Board Dec. at 2). Therefore, at the latest the respondent was aware of the deficiency in his motion as of that date. He has not averred that Ms. Paul, who was then representing him, did not inform him of the Board’s decision, and/or provide him with a copy of the same. Thus, as the respondent waitcd almost a year and a half to file the instant motion since he was, or should have been, aware of the failure of Mr. Saint-Preux and/or Ms. Paul to raise his new allegations of error against Mr. Salazar, he did not exercise due diligence in pursuing his claim, id.
 
*3 In closing, we observe that the errors alleged of Mr. Saint-Preux, of failing to thoroughly investigate the respondent’s relationship with Mr. Salazar and the issue of the noted letter, are equally true of Ms. Paul, yet no claim of ineffective assistance has been prosecuted against either of her. Similarly, although respondent’s present counsel, Ms. Khan, has been representing him since at least March 21, 2008, the instant motion was not filed until more than a year later, and only after the Second Circuit denied the respondent’s petition for review (Motion at 2). This, again, is reflective of a lack of due diligence on the respondent’s part, and serves to further undermine his argument for reopening.
 
In sum, the respondent’s motion is not exempt from the number bar on motions to reopen. Therefore, reopening is not warranted. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

In the April 16, 2007, motion the respondent claimed that he did not receive any notice from either the Immigration Court or Mr. Salazar of his scheduled hearing.

Moreover, the respondent has by his own account made no attempt to contact Mr. Saint-Preux and notify him of the allegations made against him. The fact that Mr. Saint-Preux is no longer authorized to practice law does not absolve the respondent of his responsibility to provide his former counsel of an opportunity to respond to his assertions of error. As such, the respondent has not complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to Mr. Saint-Preux as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637(BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1 st Cir. 1988).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 On December 14, 2009, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal as untimely. The respondent submitted a timely motion to reconsider on December 28, 2009. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The pending motion does not cause the Board to reconsider its prior decision in this case. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006)(a motion to reconsider must allege a material factual or legal error, assert that the Board erred in affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision without opinion, or argue a change in law).
 
The respondent claims that his former attorney agreed to file an appeal but failed to do so. First, the respondent does not explain why the untimely appeal was submitted almost 3 months past the June 22, 2009, due date, other than to vaguely state that he “had no knowledge of the fraud committed for about two months.” Given the respondent’s lack of diligence, we will not consider this appeal under our sua sponte authority. Matter of Liadov, 23 I&N Dec. 990 (BIA 2006)(Board has authority to consider a late appeal by certification under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (c), under appropriate circumstances).
 
Moreover, contrary to his arguments, the respondent fails to show compliance with Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, including that counsel be notified of the charges against him. Additionally, the complaint submitted to the state bar makes no claim about counsel agreeing to submit an appeal with the Board. Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857, 863 (6th Cir. 2006).
 
To the extent that the respondent seeks reopening of the Immigration Judge’s decision finding him subject to removal, and his argument that he is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), we lack jurisdiction over such motion, as this Board never had jurisdiction over an appeal in this case. Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974). The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Arvin G. Amatorio, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anastasie M. Senat
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), will be denied.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of India. On May 3, 2006, the Immigration Judge granted him the privilege of voluntary departure until September 3, 2006.¿FN1º The Immigration Judge denied a motion to reopen seeking adjustment of status on September 19, 2006. The Board affirmed this decision on May 3, 2007, agreeing with the Immigration Judge that the motion to reopen was untimely filed, and failed to meet the requirements for reopening under Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 20.02).
 
Over two years later, on July 27, 2009, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen with the Board. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The motion brings a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, blaming the attorneys who earlier represented him before the Immigration Judge, and Board, for his motion to reopen being denied.
 
Concerning untimely motions filed in immigration proceedings, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has stated that “attorney negligence is not, without more, a basis to toll a statute of limitations.” Munoz De Real v. Holder,__ F.3d__, 2010 455404 (7th Cir. Feb. 11, 2010). The Seventh Circuit also held in Johnson v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 795, 799 (7th Cir. 2007) that “¿iºt is a rare occasion that we reverse a decision on the basis that a time limit should have been equitably tolled… it must be shown that the claimant could not have been expected to file earlier.” The respondent claiming equitable tolling of a filing deadline must show that he has acted with due diligence. Id.; Patel v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 1011, 1016 (7th Cir. 2006); Pervaiz v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 488,489-90 (7th Cir. 2005). The pending motion provides no reason why the motions period should be tolled.
 
Moreover, the respondent fails to show compliance with any of the requirements in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Ghaffar v. Mukasey, 551 F.3d 651,656 (7th Cir. 2008).
 
*2 Finally, reopening under the Board’s discretionary sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) is reserved for exceptional situations, which have not been demonstrated here. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Laura Michalec
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on June 18, 2009, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(C) (alien convicted of firearms or destructive device violation), and denying the respondent’s motion to terminate the proceedings. On January 22, 2010, the respondent moved the Board to reopen the proceedings based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Iavorski v. U.S. I.N.S., 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent asserts that his former attorney failed to challenge the charge of removability and to seek relief on his behalf. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion, which is untimely, will be denied. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
In his motion, the respondent specifically argues that the crime underlying the charge of removability is not an aggravated felony. See generally section 101(a)(43) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43) (defining “aggravated felony”). We agree. See, e.g., U.S. v. Gamez, 577 F.3d 394 (2nd Cir. 2009) (finding that an alien’s prior conviction under New York law for criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree was not a conviction for a crime of violence, and therefore, not an aggravated felony). The respondent, however, was not found to be removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. The respondent has offered no arguments or evidence that the crime rendering the respondent removable under section 237(a)(2)(C) of the Act, i.e., attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, in violation of section 110/265.03 of the New York State Penal Law, is not a firearms offense.
 
The respondent further argues that he is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), and a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). The respondent, who plead guilty and was convicted of the crime underlying the charge of removability on June 4, 2008, is ineligible for section 212(c) relief. See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001); Cyrus v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 197 (2nd Cir. 2007). Furthermore, the respondent, who became a lawful permanent resident on December 2, 2005, is ineligible for cancellation of removal because as the result of his June 4, 2008, conviction, he cannot establish the 5 years of lawful permanent residence required under the Act. See sections 240A(a)(2), (d)(1) of the Act.
 
*2 Finally, the respondent, who claims that his mother became a naturalized United States citizen when he was 16 years old, argues that he is now a United States citizen pursuant to section 321 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1432. See Motion to Reopen at 2. Section 321 of the Act, however, was repealed and replaced by section 320 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1431. The respondent, who was born on March 13, 1986, became a lawful permanent resident on December 2, 2005, when he was 19 years old. Therefore, he was not eligible to derive United States citizenship at the time of his parent’s naturalization. See section 320(a)(3) of the Act.
 
In sum, the respondent has not shown that he suffered prejudice in these proceedings as a result of his former attorney’s handling of the case. See Iavorski v. U.S. I.N.S., supra. Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen will be denied.¿FN1º

The respondent also claims that he is now married to a United States citizen. He has also submitted a copy of receipt of a visa petition application filed on his behalf on February 27, 2003, as the unmarried child of a United States citizen. The respondent, however, has neither requested reopening to apply for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255, nor complied with the regulatory requirements for reopening to apply for such relief.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Laura Michalec
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on June 18, 2009, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(C) (alien convicted of firearms or destructive device violation), and denying the respondent’s motion to terminate the proceedings. On January 22, 2010, the respondent moved the Board to reopen the proceedings based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Iavorski v. U.S. I.N.S., 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent asserts that his former attorney failed to challenge the charge of removability and to seek relief on his behalf. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion, which is untimely, will be denied. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
In his motion, the respondent specifically argues that the crime underlying the charge of removability is not an aggravated felony. See generally section 101(a)(43) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43) (defining “aggravated felony”). We agree. See, e.g., U.S. v. Gamez, 577 F.3d 394 (2nd Cir. 2009) (finding that an alien’s prior conviction under New York law for criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree was not a conviction for a crime of violence, and therefore, not an aggravated felony). The respondent, however, was not found to be removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. The respondent has offered no arguments or evidence that the crime rendering the respondent removable under section 237(a)(2)(C) of the Act, i.e., attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, in violation of section 110/265.03 of the New York State Penal Law, is not a firearms offense.
 
The respondent further argues that he is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), and a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). The respondent, who plead guilty and was convicted of the crime underlying the charge of removability on June 4, 2008, is ineligible for section 212(c) relief. See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001); Cyrus v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 197 (2nd Cir. 2007). Furthermore, the respondent, who became a lawful permanent resident on December 2, 2005, is ineligible for cancellation of removal because as the result of his June 4, 2008, conviction, he cannot establish the 5 years of lawful permanent residence required under the Act. See sections 240A(a)(2), (d)(1) of the Act.
 
*2 Finally, the respondent, who claims that his mother became a naturalized United States citizen when he was 16 years old, argues that he is now a United States citizen pursuant to section 321 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1432. See Motion to Reopen at 2. Section 321 of the Act, however, was repealed and replaced by section 320 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1431. The respondent, who was born on March 13, 1986, became a lawful permanent resident on December 2, 2005, when he was 19 years old. Therefore, he was not eligible to derive United States citizenship at the time of his parent’s naturalization. See section 320(a)(3) of the Act.
 
In sum, the respondent has not shown that he suffered prejudice in these proceedings as a result of his former attorney’s handling of the case. See Iavorski v. U.S. I.N.S., supra, Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen will be denied.¿FN1º

IN RE: VALERIO DOMINGO-CINTO

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carolina Colin-Antonini, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mele Moreno
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals from the October 17, 2008, decision of the Immigration Judge which denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings which were held in absentia on July 3, 2008. The appeal will be sustained.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) and (iii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent’s prior counsel admits in his affidavit submitted with the respondent’s motion that his office incorrectly advised the respondent that he was not scheduled for a hearing because the attorney failed to record the new hearing date. The respondent’s own affidavit reflects that he repeatedly contacted his prior counsel’s office regarding the scheduled hearing and was incorrectly informed that it had been rescheduled. As a result of the misinformation supplied by prior counsel, the respondent missed his hearing. The respondent was thereby prejudiced, as he claims 20 years of residence in the United States and eligibility for adjustment of status. We also note that the Department of Homeland Security filed an affirmative non-opposition to the respondent’s motion. Because the attorney admits that his office incorrectly advised the respondent, the respondent has established ineffective assistance of counsel as the basis for his failure to appear.¿FN1º Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The appeal will be sustained, and the proceedings are reopened.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the motion is granted and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: MAGARIE JENNIFER SPEID
File: AXXX XX0 893 - Buffalo, NY
February 24, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William Z. Reich, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Denise C. Hochul
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Waiver of inadmissibility
 
*1 The respondent has appealed an Immigration Judge’s January 17, 2008, decision, finding the respondent removable as charged and ordering her removed to Canada. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has opposed the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including any determination of credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); see also Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493, 496 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent was previously placed in removal proceedings in September 2003 by the issuance of a Notice to Appear (“NTA”), which alleged that she had been convicted of a controlled substance violation in 1985 and alleged that she failed to disclose any arrest or conviction when she applied for a visa in June 2003. On the basis of these allegations, she was charged under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), for being inadmissible at the time of entry under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) for her drug violation, and under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) for procuring admission by willful misrepresentation of a material fact. During those removal proceedings, the respondent, through counsel, admitted to the allegations, conceded removability, and requested voluntary departure (Tr. at 21, June 1, 2004 hearing). The Immigration Judge granted the respondent 120 days to voluntarily depart in lieu of removal. The parties accepted the Immigration Judge’s decision as final and the respondent confirmed that she understood the ruling (Tr. at 23-24, June 1, 2004 hearing).
 
On December 24, 2005, upon applying for admission to the United States at the Canadian border, the respondent was once again placed in removal proceedings. The NTA contained the very same factual allegations as the previous NTA and charged her under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act as removable for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation, and under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act for engaging in fraud. Through new counsel, the respondent admitted to the drug conviction and her removability on this ground, but she denied that she made any misrepresentations in procuring her visa (Tr. at 6, Aug. 23, 2006 hearing). In this regard, the respondent’s attorney asserted that the respondent was never asked about prior arrests or convictions in applying for her visa, and argued that any concession to the contrary made by her former attorney constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.¿FN1º
 
*2 However, the Immigration Judge found that the doctrine of res judicata precluded the respondent from contesting and relitigating these issues, given the respondent’s prior admissions and concessions. The doctrine of res judicata “provides that a final judgment on the merits bars a subsequent action between the same parties over the same cause of action.” Channer v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 527 F.3d 275, 279 (2d Cir. 2008). Because the removal charges are not identical in both of the respondent’s proceedings, however, it is the doctrine of collateral estoppel which applies in the instant case.
 
The doctrine of collateral estoppel applies in removal proceedings when there has been a prior judgment between the parties that is sufficiently firm to be accorded conclusive effect, the parties had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues resolved by and necessary to the outcome of the prior judgment, and the use of collateral estoppel is not unfair. Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 1984). It precludes parties to a judgment on the merits in a prior suit from relitigating in a subsequent action issues that were actually litigated and necessary to the outcome of the prior suit. Id. Such a prior judgment conclusively establishes the ultimate facts of a subsequent removal proceeding, and bars reconsideration of issues of law resolved by the prior judgment, so long as the issues in both proceedings arise from virtually identical facts and there has been no change in the controlling law. Id. at 67.
 
The prerequisites for collateral estoppel are satisfied in the respondent’s case. The Immigration Judge’s prior removal order was a final judgment between the same parties. Both the respondent and the DHS had a “full and fair opportunity” to litigate the factual issue of whether the respondent misrepresented her criminal history when applying for her visa and the legal issue of whether the respondent was removable on that basis. Thus, it is fair to accord the judgment conclusive effect.
 
The respondent’s argument that she did not have the opportunity to litigate the issue of fraud is belied by the record. She was given a full opportunity to do so, over the course of several hearings. In fact, when the respondent’s attorney indicated that the respondent may have received a pardon of her drug conviction in Canada, the Immigration Judge continued the case to allow her to discuss with the DHS the possibility of having the fraud charge withdrawn (Tr. at 13-14, Mar. 24, 2004 hearing). Apparently, no agreement to withdraw the charge was reached, as the respondent’s attorney admitted the allegations, conceded removability and sought only voluntary departure at the next hearing (Tr. at 21, June 1, 2004).
 
The respondent further contends that it is not clear from the record whether prior counsel actually admitted to both the drug charge and the fraud charge, as the Immigration Judge did not ask her to plead to each charge or allegation individually. However, the charges and allegations had been discussed at length during numerous previous hearings, and the respondent’s attorney had waived the reading of the allegations (Tr. at 1-2). Thus, counsel’s statement at the final hearing that the respondent was admitting to “the allegations” and conceding removability is sufficient in this case to cover all charges and allegations contained in the NTA (Tr. at 21, June 1, 2004 hearing). See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal concession made by counsel is binding on the alien).
 
*3 The respondent also asserts that the Immigration Judge violated due process by refusing to play the audio tape of the prior hearing. To the contrary, the Immigration Judge offered to do just that, but the respondent’s attorney changed the subject and never returned to the issue (Tr. at 80). Likewise, the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request to order a transcript of the prior proceedings did not violate due process (Tr. at 84), as all parties had listened to the tapes and the Immigration Judge had offered to replay the tape in court. Moreover, the respondent suffered no prejudice, as we have a full copy of the transcript before us on appeal. See, e.g., Garcia-Villeda v. Mukasey, 531 F.3d 141, 149 (2d Cir. 2008) (“Parties claiming denial of due process in immigration cases must, in order to prevail, allege some cognizable prejudice fairly attributable to the challenged process”).
 
Accordingly, the respondent is barred by collateral estoppel from contesting or withdrawing her prior factual admissions. As such, her removability has been established and her appeal is dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent also argued that her former attorney filed the wrong waiver on her behalf and misadvised her to attempt to re-enter the United States while her waiver was pending. However, although the respondent filed a bar complaint against former counsel, she has not submitted any affidavit, nor has she presented any proof that her former attorney has been notified of the allegations, as required by Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for ineffective assistance of counsel claims.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margarita I. Cimadevilla
Assistant Chief Counssel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Barbados, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 16, 2009. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of fact, including credibility determinations, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). If the Board determines that an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous, it may review de novo whether the facts are sufficient to meet an applicable legal standard. See Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493, 497 (BIA 2008). We have conducted de novo review of the issues presented here.
 
As found by the Immigration Judge, the respondent was admitted to the United States as an immigrant December 2, 1984. On April 1, 2009, the respondent was convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to sell or deliver in violation of section 893.13(1)(a)(2) of the Florida Statutes Annotated.¿FN1º
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is subject to removal as charged.¿FN2º The respondent’s crime, possession of marijuana for sale or delivery, is a controlled substance violation and qualifies as an aggravated felony offense because it is comparable to the federal crime of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. See Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 49, 53-57 (2006) (a state drug offense qualifies as an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(B), if the offense would be punishable as a felony under the CSA, 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq.); 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (making distribution of marijuana unlawful); 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D) (a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) is a felony punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 5 years).
 
*2 The respondent’s aggravated felony conviction renders her ineligible for any discretionary relief, and she expressed no fear of returning to Barbados. Therefore, it does not appear that there is any relief from removal available to the respondent. The respondent has waived all applications for relief in any event (Tr. at 14).
 
We note that the respondent appears to make a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal. However, she has failed to comply with the procedural requirements for such claims set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent has also failed to demonstrate that she has been prejudiced by any action or inaction of former counsel.¿FN3º See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). To the extent that the respondent maintains that she did not commit the criminal offense which serves as the basis for removal, we note that the Board cannot entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, and will not go behind the judicial record to examine an alien’s claims regarding guilt or innocence. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Although the criminal court withheld adjudication of guilt after the respondent entered a plea of “guilty,” the judgment qualifies as a conviction for immigration purposes. See Resendiz-Alcaraz v. United States Att’y Gen., 383 F.3d 1262, 1268 (11th Cir. 2004). The evidence submitted by the respondent on appeal would not change this determination, and therefore provides no basis for reopening proceedings. See Matter of Coehlo, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).

2

The respondent claims on appeal that she is a United States citizen and, by implication, not subject to removal. However, the respondent informed the Immigration Court that her father became a naturalized citizen after she became 18 years old (Tr. at 16). Therefore, the respondent could not have derived citizenship through her father’s naturalization. See former section 321(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1432(a).

3

The respondent’s appeal appears to reflect a mistaken belief that the attorney who represented her before the Immigration Court is also her counsel on appeal. However, no attorney has entered an appearance before the Board on the respondent’s behalf.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pamela Lindmark, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance by his prior counsel. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion and it is therefore deemed unopposed. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The motion complies with the procedural steps for asserting a proper ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). Further, the respondent has satisfactorily established that he was precluded from presenting an application for relief under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), because his prior counsel failed to timely file the application. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (requiring a showing of prejudice in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel). We therefore find that he has suffered prejudice as a result of ineffective assistance from his counsel. Accordingly, the motion is granted and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen and native of the Dominican Republic, appeals the May 2, 2008, decision of the Immigration Judge denying her motion to reopen removal proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed an opposition. We will dismiss the appeal.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008).
 
A hearing was held before the Immigration Judge on March 10, 2008, to consider the respondent’s Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence (Form I-751). According to the parties and the Immigration Judge, this hearing concluded early when the respondent, through her then counsel, requested voluntary departure. By an order dated March 10, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s Form I-751 but granted her 60 days voluntary departure.
 
In her motion to reopen, the respondent argues that she had ineffective assistance of counsel at the March 2008 hearing. Specifically, she claims that her former counsel did not allow her to fully present her case, and requested voluntary departure before consulting her or obtaining her consent (Motion to Reopen at 1). However, in making this allegation, the respondent has failed to meet any of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). That is, she has failed, even on appeal, to submit an affidavit detailing the agreement she had with her former counsel, assert that the former counsel has been informed of the allegations leveled against him and been given an opportunity to respond, or confirm that a bar complaint has been filed against the former counsel, or alternatively, explain why such a complaint has not been filed. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639; Punzalan v. Holder, 575 F.3d 107, 109 n.1(1st Cir. 2009).
 
*2 Further, in the absence of egregious circumstances, an alien is bound by the “reasonable tactical actions” of his or her counsel. Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938 (BIA 1995). Based on the very limited detail contained in the respondent’s allegations, we are unable to conclude that her former counsel’s actions were egregious. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (holding that there is a strong presumption that a distinct and formal admission made before, during, or even after a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity is a reasonable tactical decision).
 
In view of the foregoing, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: GAFAR WINSTON YOUNG A.K.A. WINSTON BROWN A.K.A. CAFOI YOUNG
File: AXXX XX7 334 - Fishkill, NY
January 28, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
C. Cullen Sheppard
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 In a decision dated September 29, 2009, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable; determined that he did not apply for, and did not demonstrate eligibility for, any relief from removal; and ordered him removed from the United States to Jamaica. The respondent appealed from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed. The request for oral argument is denied.
 
The respondent was found removable on the four charged grounds, as in the United States in violation of law under section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B); as convicted of an aggravated felony under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, in conjunction with both sections 101(a)(43)(F) and 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(F) and 1101(a)(43)(G); and as convicted of a controlled substance violation under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act. As substantiated by conviction documents (Ex. 3), he has New York convictions upon guilty pleas on November 24, 2008, for assault in the first degree, robbery in the first degree, and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, cocaine. He was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 5 years, 5 years, and 1 year for these crimes, respectively. The record reflects that he arrived in the United States in 2002.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that he fears returning to Jamaica because he could be killed by the same unidentified individuals who murdered his sister, brother-in-law, and uncle (Br. at 1 et seq.).
 
We observe that the respondent’s assault and robbery convictions are for both aggravated felonies and particularly serious crimes. See sections 208(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 208(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 1158(b)(2)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c)(4) and 1208.16(d)(2) and (3) (2009). As an alien who has been convicted of at least one offense that is a particularly serious crime as well as an aggravated felony, the respondent is statutorily ineligible for asylum and withholding under the Act and is eligible only for deferral of removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (“CAT”). In addition, we note that the respondent’s convictions for the assault and robbery offenses are for crimes that are per se particularly serious, since he has been sentenced to imprisonment of at least 5 years for each of those offenses. See sections 208(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 208(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act; see also section 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(B).
 
*2 With respect to CAT, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent abandoned such application for failure to timely submit it by the deadline of September 25, 2009, following his final removal hearing on August 12, 2009 (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 11). Concerning the respondent’s present claim of torture, we find that he has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for deferral of removal under the CAT at this time, based on his cursory and unsubstantiated allegations regarding his fear of returning to Jamaica.
 
Next on appeal, the respondent asserts that he will face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship upon his removal (Br. at 4-5). To the extent that he seeks to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1), he is statutorily ineligible for that relief because he cannot establish the necessary 10 years of continuous physical presence in the United States dating from his 2002 arrival and because he has been convicted of offenses under section 237(a)(2) of the Act. See section 240A(b)(1)(A) and (C) of the Act. His period of continuous physical presence was deemed to end in October 2006, when he committed the robbery crime. See section 240A(d)(1) of the Act; Ex. 3. We therefore need not and do not reach consideration of whether he can meet the other section 240A(b) requirements, including whether he can demonstrate that his removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his spouse, parent, or child who is a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident, as required under section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act. We observe that extreme hardship to an alien himself is no longer considered under section 240A(b) of the Act, although it was relevant to whether a respondent could establish eligibility for suspension of deportation under former section 244(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254(a), which provision the respondent has referenced (Br. at 4).
 
To the extent that the respondent wishes to apply for suspension of deportation under former section 244(a) of the Act, we note that he cannot do so in these removal proceedings, following the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-627 (“IIRIRA”). If IIRIRA had never been enacted and the respondent were in deportation proceedings, he might have submitted an application for suspension of deportation under former section 244(a)(1) of the Act. Former section 244(a)(1) required only 7 years of continuous physical presence, included the lower standard of extreme hardship, and permitted extreme hardship to the alien himself to be considered. However, we reiterate that suspension of deportation is a form of relief that is not available to the respondent in the current removal proceedings. The respondent appropriately was placed in removal proceedings because the proceedings for him were commenced with the service of the Notice to Appear (“NTA”) on February 18, 2009, which date is nearly 12 years subsequent to April 1, 1997, the general effective date of IIRIRA. To the extent that the respondent is challenging the timing of the institution of his removal proceedings, we lack jurisdiction to second-guess the decision of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to initiate removal proceedings by serving the NTA on February 18, 2009. The determination to place an alien in proceedings is a matter of prosecutorial discretion entirely within the authority of the DHS. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980); see also Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 48 (BIA 1982).
 
*3 The respondent also has referenced section 240A(b)(2) of the Act (Br. at 3), which pertains to “special rule” cancellation for a battered spouse or child. However, he has not presented any probative evidence to demonstrate that he is prima facie eligible for relief under such provision.
 
We do not find that a remand is warranted for consideration of any claim for CAT deferral, any claim for cancellation of removal, or for any other reason in this case.
 
In a supplementary appellate submission, the respondent contends that his legal representative failed to assist him with filing a CAT application in Immigration Court. To the extent that the respondent asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in his removal proceedings, he has failed to offer any evidence that substantially complies with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and he further has failed to demonstrate that he suffered the requisite prejudice from counsel’s alleged inaction, such that a remand for consideration of his claim would be warranted. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009).
 
To the extent that the respondent alleges that his removal proceedings were unfair, we find that he has not demonstrated any error by the Immigration Judge in handling his hearings. We also find that he has not demonstrated any resultant prejudice such as would affect the outcome of his case and would amount to a due process violation. See Waldron v. INS, 17 F.3d 511 (2d Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1014 (1994). To the extent that the respondent alleges that certain provisions of the immigration laws are unconstitutional, we observe that this Board cannot rule on the constitutionality of laws enacted by Congress. See Matter of Fuentes-Campos, 21 I&N Dec. 905 (BIA 1997).
 
Finally, to the extent that the respondent maybe seeking humanitarian relief to enable him to stay in the United States, we recognize that this Board and the Immigration Judges have limited jurisdiction and can grant only those forms of relief from removal that are expressly authorized by Congress. See Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734 (BIA 1988). We have no power to grant equitable remedies or to confer general humanitarian relief on aliens, even though a particular case may pose sympathetic circumstances. If the respondent wishes to obtain relief on humanitarian grounds, he must pursue such relief with the DHS.
 
*4 Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX4 920 - Newark, NJ
January 15, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Emmanuel Ahia, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, appeals from the November 3, 2008, decision of the Immigration Judge denying her motion to rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on October 14, 2008, and reopen proceedings. The respondent has filed an appeal brief; the Department of Homeland Security has not. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.
 
Subsequent to the entry of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent retained new counsel. On appeal, the respondent asserts for the first time claims of ineffective assistance of counsel against two of her prior attorneys of record, Jennifer Klapper, Esquire, and Gary T. Jodha, Esquire.¿FN1º
 
Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are governed by the standards found in our precedent decision Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). The United States Court of Appeal for the Third Circuit (under whose jurisdiction the instant case arises) has cautioned against a strict interpretation of the Lozada requirements, noting that the case “serve¿sº as a threshold and a screening mechanism to help the agency assess the substantial number of ineffective assistance claims it receives.” Rranci v. Att’y Gen., 540 F.3d 165, 173 (3d Cir. 2008) (citing Fadiga v. Att’y Gen., 488 F.3d 142, 155 (3d Cir. 2007).
 
We find that attorney Jodha’s failure to inform the respondent of the date of her hearing (and to make adequate efforts to ascertain such date) constituted ineffective assistance. We additionally find that the respondent has satisfied the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
Although the respondent herself did not notify Mr. Jodha of the allegations (as required by the second prong of Lozada), we find such requirement to have been satisfied. In a correspondence dated October 21, the Immigration Judge requested Mr. Jodha to inform her as to whether he had in fact substituted as the respondent’s counsel by October 14, 2008, and was “already in possession of the client file” by that date. The Immigration Judge continued that if so, “Mr. Jodha evidently owed Respondent the duty to determine the date, place, and time of the next scheduled hearing because because he had obtained her file and Respondent had already advised former counsel to stop working on Respondent’s case.”
 
*2 Attorney Jodha responded in writing on October 31, 2008. As attorney of record, Mr. Jodha also received the Immigration Judge’s November 3, 2008, decision, in which she determined that there was “a lack of evidence that Mr. Jodha…made reasonable effort to determine the status of this case” (I.J. at 4). Upon review of the entire record, we find no clear error in such determination. As the present allegations of ineffective assistance by Mr. Jodha are identical to the issues already raised in the Immigration Judge’s October 14, 2008, correspondence and her November 3, 2008, decision, we find that prior counsel received adequate notice and the opportunity to respond. See Rranci v. Att’y Gen., supra.
 
As we find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that she and her firm “were both diligent to the Respondent” (I.J. at 4), we find no ineffective assistance by Ms. Klapper.
 
Based on the finding of ineffective assistance by Mr. Jodha, we will rescind the in absentia order of removal. See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The order of removal is rescinded, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Manuel Rivera, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Leslie Smith Turner
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed the July 17, 2008, decision of an Immigration Judge denying her motion to reconsider. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record indicates that the respondent was granted voluntary departure on March 6, 2000, at the conclusion of removal proceedings, with an alternate order of removal to El Salvador. In March 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge concluded that the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was without merit, and the motion was denied as untimely filed. The respondent subsequently filed a motion to reconsider that decision. The denial of that motion to reconsider is the subject of this appeal.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec.493 (BIA 2008).
 
Based on our standard of review, we find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the motion to reconsider. The respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is based, not on new evidence or information that was recently discovered, but on facts that were well established at the conclusion of her proceedings on March 6, 2000. The respondent has not shown due diligence in filing the motion. To hold otherwise would vitiate the statutory and regulatory deadlines, which are designed to bring finality to immigration proceedings. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992) (motions to reopen are especially disfavored in immigration proceedings because every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien). Furthermore, the respondent did not meet the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). An affidavit was not submitted with the motion to reopen, and was only submitted with the motion to reconsider. Prior counsel was apparently not notified, and no explanation for the failure to file a bar complaint was included. Finally, we agree with the Immigration Judge for the reasons stated in his decision that respondent has not shown how counsel’s apparent lack of preparation caused the respondent to lie at the hearing. Accordingly, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The final administrative order in this case was issued by the Board on December 15, 2003, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s May 3, 2002, decision finding the respondent, a native and citizen of India, removable under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act and denying him relief from removal on discretionary grounds. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denied the respondent’s petition for review in 2005. Respondent’s motion at 5. Nearly six years after the final administrative order, on November 30, 2009, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen renewing his request to pursue adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i), based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent does not dispute the untimeliness of the motion, but argues that the deadline should either be equitably tolled or alternatively that we reopen sua sponte. We will deny the motion.
 
There is no issue regarding the respondent’s inadmissibility as charged pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. Rather, the respondent argues that the two counsel who represented him before the Immigration Judge and on appeal were ineffective in failing to establish his eligibility for section 245(i) relief, which he argues was denied based on the Immigration Judge’s erroneous finding that he is inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i).
 
However, contrary to the respondent’s arguments, the Immigration Judge simply noted the basis for the former Immigration and Naturalization Service’s denial of his application and did not make an independent finding that any of the section 212(a)(9) statutory bars to admission apply. Rather, Immigration Judge found that the equities presented in this case were outweighed not only by the respondent’s repeated immigration violations, but also the disingenuous nature of his representations regarding his residency and immigration history (including his use of a different name which resulted in the assignment of a different alien number after his illegal reentry) and his lack of candor and forthrightness with the court. The Immigration Judge therefore found that the respondent was not deserving of a favorable exercise of discretion and denied, on discretionary grounds, even the minimal relief of voluntary departure. We are not persuaded that the Immigration Judge’s assessment of the respondent’s discretionary factors would change if these proceedings were reopened for further consideration of the respondent’s adjustment of status application. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (a party who files a motion to remand or a motion to reopen bears a “heavy burden” of proving that “if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all of the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case”). We likewise find that the respondent has not demonstrated that he is worthy of a favorable exercise of discretion. Rather than providing new favorable equities, the late motion compounds the respondent’s prior immigration violations by showing a continued disregard for the final removal order. The Sixth Circuit denied the respondent’s petition for review in 2005. See I.N.S. v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988) (holding that the Board “may leap ahead, as it were, over two threshold concerns (prima facie case and new evidence/reasonable explanation), and simply determine that even if they were met, movant would not be entitled to discretionary grant of relief”).
 
*2 Finally, we add that the failure to argue that a section 212(a)(9)(B)(i) bar did not apply, and that the former Immigration and Naturalization Service had thus incorrectly calculated the period of the respondent’s illegal presence by measuring the length of his illegal presence after his last departure, does not constitute “egregious” ineffectiveness given the undeveloped state of the law regarding the section 212(a)(9)(B) bars at the relevant times. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (“Litigants are generally bound by the conduct of their attorneys, absent egregious circumstances.”). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). We point out that our decision in Matter of Rodarte-Roman, 23 I&N Dec. 905 (BIA 2006), which clarified that the requisite period of illegal presence must occur prior to the departure, was not issued until well after our dismissal of the respondent’s appeal in 2003. We therefore find that untimely reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance is not warranted here. We also decline to exercise our discretion to reopen the proceedings sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (the rules governing motions are intended to bring finality to proceedings and the Board’s sua sponte authority is not meant to be used as a cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might cause hardship).
 
Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN RE: PABLO CANDIDO MONTES
File: AXXX XX1 140 - San Francisco, CA
December 31, 2009
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John Nguyen, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a male native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 22, 2008. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on March 26, 2008. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On appeal, the respondent reiterates that he did not receive proper notice of his hearing because his former counsel did not inform him of the specific date and time of his hearing. Upon de novo review, we find that proper notice was provided to the respondent. The record reflects that the Immigration Judge reopened proceedings on two prior occasions after the respondent failed to appear. Following the Immigration Judge’s decision reopening the respondent’s case a second time, a hearing notice dated July 31, 2007, was mailed to the respondent’s attorney of record, Deok J. Kim, Esquire. See Exh. 15. We find that the respondent received proper notice inasmuch as written notice of his hearing was provided to his attorney of record. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). The respondent concedes in his brief that his attorney appeared at his hearing without the respondent, indicating that the hearing notice was received by Mr. Kim. The fact that his attorney was allowed to withdraw on the day of the respondent’s last hearing is irrelevant to the issue of proper notice. To the extent that the respondent argues exceptional circumstances because his attorney did not tell him the date and time of his hearing, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not satisfy any of the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
We are also not persuaded by the respondent’s argument on appeal that he is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b. The respondent was personally served with a Notice to Appear which indicates that he received oral notice in his native Spanish of the consequences of failing to appear for his removal hearing, he is therefore statutorily ineligible for such relief See section 240(b)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(7). See also Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998) (explaining that an in absentia deportation order need not always be rescinded before it can be reopened).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rhonda F. Gelfman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christina M. Martyak
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on June 3, 2009, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On September 1, 2009, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent contends that his former counsel, Ariol Eugene, provided ineffective assistance of counsel before the Immigration Judge and has refused to provide him with a copy of his file. The respondent was represented by different counsel before the Board.
 
The respondent requests that the Board grant his motion to reopen, motion for extension of time to comply with his motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, and motion for a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security objects to the granting of the motion.
 
The respondent has not submitted any supplemental evidence since the filing of the original motion. The original motion does not demonstrate that the respondent complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), with respect to Mr. Eugene. Further, although the respondent generally alleges that he was denied his right to counsel and due process based on ineffective assistance, he has not identified any particular instances of ineffective assistance of counsel or demonstrated prejudice. Accordingly, the motions are denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio Salazar, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Gregory Fehlings
Deputy Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent appeals the September 16, 2009, Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen following the October 16, 2000, issuance of an in absentia order of removal in her case. Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act; Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 722-23 (BIA 1999). The respondent’s motion to reopen included a declaration asserting that the respondent had “received no … documents to warn ¿herº of any immigration violations.” The Immigration Judge denied the motion based upon his findings that the respondent (1) had been personally served with the Notice to Appear (NTA) (Exh. 1), which included a warning regarding any failure to appear and the respondent’s statutory change-of-address obligation, and (2) had made no claims in her declaration as to her correct address at the time of her missed hearing and any efforts she had made to comply with her statutory address obligations.
 
We recently held in Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674 (BIA 2008), that
¿iºn determining whether a respondent has rebutted the weaker presumption of delivery applicable ¿where a notice of hearing is sent to the respondent by regular mail, as opposed to certified mailº, an Immigration Judge may consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the following: (1) the respondent’s affidavit; (2) affidavits from family members or other individuals who are knowledgeable about the facts relevant to whether notice was received; (3) the respondent’s actions upon learning of the in absentia order, and whether due diligence was exercised in seeking to redress the situation; (4) any prior affirmative application for relief, indicating that the respondent had an incentive to appear; (5) any prior application for relief filed with the Immigration Court or any prima facie evidence in the record or the respondent’s motion of statutory eligibility for relief, indicating that the respondent had an incentive to appear; (6) the respondent’s previous attendance at Immigration Court hearings, if applicable; and (7) any other circumstances or evidence indicating possible nonreceipt of notice. We emphasize that these are just examples of the types of evidence that can support a motion to reopen. Immigration Judges are neither required to deny reopening if exactly such evidence is not provided nor obliged to grant a motion, even if every type of evidence is submitted. Each case must be evaluated based on its own particular circumstances and evidence.
 
 
*2 The Immigration Judge’s findings that the respondent was personally served with the NTA,¿FN1º had been sent her notice of hearing (Exh. 2) at the same address listed on the NTA, and made no representations as to her correct address at the time of the hearing notice’s issuance are not clearly erroneous. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The record contains no evidence that the respondent had attended an earlier immigration hearing, had an available form of relief from removal,¿FN2º or had informed the immigration court of any change of address. Applying a de novo standard of review, we conclude that, given these facts, the respondent’s declaration’s inaccurate and unspecific claim that she received no documents with regard to her removal proceedings is insufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery of the mailed notice of her October 16, 2000, hearing.
 
On appeal the respondent raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by asserting that prior counsel sub-contracted with another attorney to file her motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge; that the filing attorney failed to point out in the motion that an immigrant visa petition filed on behalf of the respondent was pending; that the filing attorney “failed to argue to the Court that the disgruntled ex-husband controlled the dwelling where the notice was sent and could have received the notice by way of the woman he was then living with thus depriving the Respondent of notice;” that the filing attorney failed to submit applications for relief with the motion to reopen; that the filing attorney failed to investigate the fact that the respondent had applied for United States citizenship; that the filing attorney failed to provide the Immigration Judge with “a proper reason” for the respondent’s prior failure to appear, specifically that the respondent had lost her immigration documents when she was forced to leave her husband’s home; and that the filing attorney failed to file an appeal or to alert the respondent of the need to file an appeal.
 
Our review of allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel is governed by our analysis in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Matter of Lozada, we stated that a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the applicant setting forth in detail the agreement between the applicant and her legal representative and what actions were to be taken on her behalf, (2) that the counsel whose reputation is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) an indication of whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. The respondent has not complied with the first two of these requirements.
 
*3 Even if the respondent had met all of these requirements, however, we would nevertheless find that her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails. First, in the absence of an affidavit by the respondent as to her agreement with her first attorney, she cannot establish that she had an agreement with him, much less that he failed to comply with the agreement by hiring another attorney to prepare the motion. Second, the respondent has not shown that an immigrant visa petition was pending on her behalf at the time of her missed 2000 hearing or that she was eligible to apply for naturalization, and therefore filing counsel cannot be found incompetent for not raising such claims. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793 (9th Cir. 2005). Third, even if the respondent had shown that she was eligible to apply for some form of relief at the time that the motion to reopen was filed, the failure to submit applications for relief would result in no prejudice to the respondent, see Mohammed v. Gonzales, supra, at 793-94, unless the respondent could first demonstrate that she had not received notice of her missed hearing, as would be required to rescind the in absentia order of removal under section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act. Fourth, the respondent’s claim that she failed to appear at her 2000 hearing because she did not receive notice due to having left her home, where her husband remained with a girlfriend, does not explain why she failed to file a change of address form, as instructed in her NTA. Finally, an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen was in fact filed, and therefore the respondent suffered no prejudice by prior counsel’s alleged failure to file or to alert her of the need to file. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, supra.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In his December 7, 2009, brief, counsel repeatedly asserts that the respondent was not served with the NTA. However, the Certificate of Service box on the NTA (Exh. 1) contains a signature by the respondent acknowledging personal receipt. The NTA included a warning regarding any failure to appear and the respondent’s statutory change-of-address obligation. Counsel asserts on appeal that the respondent was not advised in Spanish of the consequences of a failure to appear, but (1) he has not cited any statute or regulation requiring such translation; and (2) the respondent has not claimed that any such lack of translation was the reason for her failure to appear.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stuart Altman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William A. Lund
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the People’s Republic of China, appeals from the January 5, 2009, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to rescind the in absentia order entered on May 21, 2008, and reopen proceedings. Both parties have filed appeal briefs. The record will be remanded.
 
We review factual findings of the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We may review questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other non-fact issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493, 497 (BIA 2008).
 
On November 21, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge that was prepared by his prior counsel, Liu Yu. The motion alleged ineffective assistance of counsel against Mr. Yu’s own office, but argued that it was not necessary for him to comply with all of the requirements for establishing such grounds under our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).¿FN1º The Immigration Judge rejected such argument, and denied the motion for failure to fully comply with the requirements of Lozada (I.J. at 4-5).
 
The respondent retained new counsel on appeal, who filed a second motion to reopen with this Board on March 3, 2009, and an appeal brief on March 25, 2009.¿FN2º The second motion was accompanied by additional evidence intended to fully comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. The Department of Homeland Security responded with a brief arguing that such motion is numerically barred under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3).
 
Pursuant to our de novo review, we affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. However, we will deem the second motion to reopen (which was filed during the pendency of the respondent’s appeal) as a motion to remand. In light of the unusual circumstances presented here, we deem it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge to consider the new evidence in the first instance and determine whether rescission is warranted.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for issuance of a new order not inconsistent with the foregoing decision.

In arguing that it was not necessary to comply with the requirement under Matter of Lozada, supra, of filing a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority, prior counsel claimed that the purpose of such requirement “is to prevent aliens or their counsel of ineffective assistance counsel from the collusive of the reopen proceedings. There is no such collusive ¿sicº.” Motion to Reopen at 2.

In his appeal brief, the respondent relied on the precedent decision of the Attorney General in Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), which was published 2 days subsequent to the entry of the Immigration Judge’s order in this case. We note that the Compean decision was vacated in a decision of the Attorney General dated June 3, 2009. Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009).

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Gerrie Zhang
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Pakistan, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s March 26, 2008, decision finding she did not have jurisdiction to review his motion to reopen. During the pendency of his appeal, the respondent filed a motion to reopen directly with the Board. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and his motion to reopen will be denied.
 
As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent’s case was last before the Board on September 21, 2005. Therefore, the respondent was required to file his motion to reopen with the Board. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Consequently, the Immigration Judge properly found that she did not have jurisdiction over the merits of the motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is both untimely and numerically barred, as outlined in the regulations. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). To be timely, the respondent’s motion would have been due on or before September 21, 2005. See id (imposing, in general, a 90-day deadline for motions to reopen). However, this motion to reopen was filed on February 19, 2008. Additionally, this is the respondent’s fifth request for reopening, and we have previously denied motions to reopen in the instant case filed by him through orders issued by the Board on October 11, 2005, April 23, 2007, July 24, 2007, and September 19, 2007. As a result, the respondent has exceeded the single motion to reopen limit imposed by regulation. See id.
 
In his motion, the respondent maintains that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorney who initially represented him before the Immigration Court and the Board and an attorney who subsequently represented him before the Board in filing a motion to reopen based on the alleged ineffective assistance of his first attorney. In particular, he maintains that the first attorney erred in seeking a continuance on his behalf rather than asserting his eligibility for adjustment of status and in failing to completely advise him of his rights and responsibilities pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s grant of voluntary departure. The respondent argues that the second attorney failed to timely file a motion to reopen based on his claim of ineffective assistance.
 
*2 Although the respondent has met the procedural requirement for ineffective assistance outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we find that he has not established that he was prejudiced by his prior counsels’ actions. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640; see also Ogbemudia v. INS, 988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir. 1993) (requiring the respondent to demonstrate “substantial prejudice” in order to establish a due process violation). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, supra. This requires a showing that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed had the negligent representation not occurred. Id.
 
As we noted in our July 24, 2007, decision, the respondent failed to demonstrate that he exercised due diligence in pursuing his ineffective assistance claim against his first attorney. Moreover, although he cites this attorney’s decision to seek voluntary departure on his behalf as legal error, the respondent’s dissatisfaction with his former counsel’s strategy in pursuing relief is not a ground for reopening based on ineffective assistance. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998). Finally, the respondent fails to show prejudice as a result of his first attorney’s allegedly ineffective representation, as he was not eligible for relief when the administratively final order was entered.
 
The respondent alleges that his second attorney failed to act with due haste or diligence in pursuing his ineffective assistance claim against his prior counsel, but he has failed to demonstrate any resulting prejudice. He asserts that he is eligible to adjust status as an alien grandfathered under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Specifically, he asserts that this eligibility arises from a labor certification filed on behalf of Nighat Sultana on April 30, 2001, and that Ms. Sultana is his mother. However, the respondent has not provided documentary evidence of his qualifying relationship with Ms. Sultana. As a result, the respondent has failed to provide prima facie evidence that he is a grandfathered alien, and thus, he has failed to demonstrate prejudice as a result of his second attorney’s alleged ineffective performance.
 
Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

Sec. 212(a)(9)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(A)(i)º- Previously ordered removed at arrival
 
  
APPLICATION: Relief
 
The respondent has filed a timely appeal from an Immigration Judge’s September 1, 2009, decision, finding him removable, as charged, based on his admissions (Tr. at 3), and record of convictions, and statutorily ineligible for relief from removal. The appeal will be dismissed. The respondent’s request to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is granted under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). See Matter of Chicas, 19 I&N Dec. 114 (BIA 1984).
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2009); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2009); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
Upon our de novo review of the issues presented here, we have concluded that the respondent presents no arguments on appeal that would cause us to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision.¿FN1º Based on the record before us, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is subject to removal from the United States based on the respondent’s admissions in this case (Tr. at 3). See section 240(c)(2)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(2)(A). Moreover, the respondent has failed to establish his eligibility for any relief from removal, including a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). See also section 240(c)(4)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Furthermore, to the extent the respondent seeks to challenge his previous order of removal dated January 20, 2005, which was executed on March 14, 2005, now alleging ineffective assistance of former counsel, neither the Immigration Judge nor the Board has jurisdiction to consider the issue. The respondent has not shown that he ever raised the issue of ineffective assistance of former counsel in the former proceedings prior to his removal, or complied with the Board’s decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 851 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (setting out the requirements that would support a motion to reopen based on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel). The respondent has not demonstrated that his removal from the United States in 2005, was not made pursuant to a lawful order of deportation. With limited exceptions not applicable here, the departure of an alien from the United States pursuant to a lawful order of deportation has the effect of depriving either the Immigration Judge or this Board of jurisdiction over the prior proceedings. See Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008) (holding that the Board lacks authority to reopen removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings if the alien has departed the United States after those administrative proceedings have been completed); Matter of G-N-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 281, 288 (BIA 1998); Matter of Okoh, 20 I&N Dec. 864, 865 (BIA 1994); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(d) and 1003.23(b)(1).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Saadia Siddique, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Debra Robinson
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on June 5, 2009, when we found that the respondent had filed, and then withdrawn, a motion to reopen his proceedings. Previously, in a decision dated June 11, 2008, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s October 29, 2007, denial of his motion to reopen his in absentia proceedings. The respondent has now filed an untimely motion to reopen on May 20, 2009. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that we should reopen proceedings based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel that he received from the attorneys who represented him before the Immigration Court and this Board. Specifically, the respondent argues, first, that his prior attorney, Mr. Yang, Esquire, failed to inform the respondent that he was required to appear in court, and that this ineffective advice resulted in his in absentia order, his inability to request relief in the form of adjustment of status, and the loss of his opportunity to request voluntary departure. The respondent also argues that his second attorney, Mr. Cianciolo prejudiced Mr. Multani by inadequately representing him in his motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, and by failing, in the motion to reopen, to include an argument regarding Mr. Yang’s ineffective assistance of counsel.¿FN1º The respondent further argues that Mr. Cianciolo compounded his ineffective assistance by filing an appeal from the denial of this motion, which was dismissed by the Board on June 11, 2008.
 
In support of his motion, the respondent has filed an affidavit outlining his allegations, as well as letters to his previous attorneys, letters to the Iowa Supreme Court making known his grievances, and a response from Mr. Yang, Esquire. While the respondent has substantially complied with the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we agree with the DHS’ argument that the respondent has not indicated that he filed this motion with due diligence. See Habchy v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 858 (8th Cir. 2006). The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal in June of 2008, and the respondent attests, in his affidavit, that “he did not trust (Ms. Cianciolo) at that point” so he did not proceed with any further legal contract with her. Therefore, the respondent has lost confidence in Ms. Cianciolo at some point prior to mid-2008, and yet the respondent did not pursue an ineffective assistance of counsel claim until a year later, in May of 2009. We also note that the Immigration Judge recognized, in his denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in 2007, that “it (was) somewhat unusual that the respondent did not apparently contact his attorney (Mr. Yang) following the November 8, 2005 hearing to determine the date of his next hearing rather than waiting nearly two years to file a motion to reopen alleging ‘exceptional circumstances beyond his control’ (for purposes of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii)). The respondent does not explain the reason for either of these delays, except to say that he assumed that because his “labor certification was pending, (the hearing) was still ongoing.”
 
*2 Accordingly, we do not find that the respondent has filed this motion with due diligence, and we, thus, find no merit to the respondent’s motion, and no reason to except the motion from the timeliness requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Abisag Ayala, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rubab Z. Razvi
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s April 29, 2009, decision to deny his untimely motion to reopen. On January 7, 2009, the final administrative order in the respondent’s removal proceeding was entered by the Immigration Judge. On April 16, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. On April 29, 2009, the Immigration Judge denied his motion because the respondent failed to timely file and failed to adequately support his application for cancellation of removal with proper documentation.
 
“¿Aº party may file only one motion to reopen deportation or exclusion proceedings (whether before the Board of the Immigration Judge) and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent did not file his motion to reopen within 90 days of the final administrative decision, nor did he file it on or before September 30, 1996. As such, we agree with the Immigration Judge that his motion to reopen the final administrative order is time-barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies to the time limitations for motions to reopen during periods when a respondent is prevented from filing his motion because of deception, fraud, or error, provided that the respondent acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002). The respondent has argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
We note that the respondent failed to meet any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, and did not show that he had been prejudiced in his prior proceedings. The steps set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, include, inter alia, that the motion reflect 1) the agreement with counsel; (2) that prior counsel has been notified and afforded an opportunity to respond; and 3) whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. Despite the respondent statement that he has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, supra, the record does not support his position. The respondent has not explained the agreement he had with counsel, given counsel notice of the ineffective assistance and an opportunity to respond, nor has the respondent filed any complaint with the appropriate authorities or explained why he failed to do so. See Respondent’s Attachments to Brief on Appeal. See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001).
 
*2 Moreover, an alien must establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought before a motion to reopen will be granted. See, e.g., INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent did not submit the required documentation to support his prior motion to reopen. Furthermore, the respondent has not filed such documentation on appeal. In the absence of such, the Board cannot consider the respondent’s request for reopening to apply for cancellation of removal as he had not demonstrated statutory eligibility for this relief. Matter of K-L-, 20 I&N Dec. 654, 659 (BIA 1993). Therefore, the respondent has also not demonstrated prejudice from the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004) (must show the outcome might have been affected had the negligent representation not occurred).
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX2 011 - Guaynabo, PR

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lymari Casta, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jorge A. Ramos
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 26, 2008. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. On appeal, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the respondent maintains that his counsel informed him that he did not need to appear for his hearing, inasmuch as his hearing had been rescheduled to a different date and time. The respondent’s appeal will be sustained.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We find that the respondent has demonstrated that exceptional circumstances prevented the respondent from attending his hearing. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). As the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) recognizes on appeal, the respondent has complied with the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, and his motion to reopen was filed within 180 days of the entry of the in absentia order of removal. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C).
 
Furthermore, we find that the respondent’s counsel committed ineffective assistance, which prevented the respondent from attending his scheduled hearing before the Immigration Judge on May 13, 2008, at 10:30 a.m. The record reflects that the respondent’s counsel made numerous requests for continuances before the Immigration Judge based upon conflicts of schedule and due to the respondent’s pending visa petition (Form 1-130). On the day of the respondent’s scheduled May 13, 2008, hearing, the respondent’s counsel faxed a request for a further continuance to the Immigration Court approximately 2 hours prior to the respondent’s 10:30 a.m. hearing. According to the respondent’s affidavit, he was already traveling to the hearing when he received a telephone call from his counsel’s office informing him that he did not have to appear in Immigration Court that morning, because his hearing had been rescheduled. See R’s brief at Exh. C. However, the Immigration Judge did not grant respondent’s counsel’s motion for a further continuance and ordered the respondent removed in absentia when he failed to appear for his hearing.
 
*2 Inasmuch as the record reflects that the respondent was misinformed by his counsel that he did not need to appear for his May 13, 2008, hearing, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen and remand the record to the Immigration Judge to provide the respondent with a hearing regarding the respondent’s removability from the United States and eligibility for relief from removal. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

IN RE: VICTOR ANTONIO ESTRADA-GARCIA A.K.A. VICTOR GARCIA
File: AXXX XX8 158 - Memphis, TN
December 14, 2009
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
*1 A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was mailed on July 22, 2009. The appeal was accordingly due on or before August 21, 2009. The record reflects, however, that the Notice of Appeal was filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on November 19, 2009. We accordingly find that the appeal is untimely. In conjunction with the appeal the respondent has filed a Motion to File Late Appeal. Respondent states that his former counsel neglected to file his appeal on his behalf. However, he provides no evidence in support of this claim and does not comply with the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, the motion to accept the late filed appeal is denied. The Immigration Judge’s decision is therefore now final, and the record will be returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15. The record before us indicates that the respondent may have waived appeal. In view of our disposition of this case, we need not determine whether the respondent made a knowing and intelligent waiver in this case.
 
We note that because we are dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See sections 240(c)(6)(A) & (B) and 240(c)(7)(A) & C of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6)(A) & (B) and (c)(7)(A) & C; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); see Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
*2 In light of the foregoing, the following order will be entered.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Greg Radics
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude (sustained)
 
Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)º - Controlled substance violation (sustained)
 
Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document (not sustained)
  
APPLICATION: Section 212(c) waiver
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s July 25, 2008, decision. In that decision, the Immigration Judge deemed the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1996), abandoned. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
At the October 12, 2005, master calendar hearing, the Immigration Judge reset the hearing for October 30, 2006, so that the respondent could submit his application for relief (Tr. at 4-8). On October 18, 2006, the respondent’s counsel filed a Motion to Withdraw Representation as Attorney, which was granted by the Immigration Judge. For reasons not set forth in the record, the hearing was again reset for July 25, 2008. At the July 25, 2008, hearing, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for a continuance and deemed his application for relief abandoned because it had not been filed. The respondent now appeals from the Immigration Judge’s July 25, 2008, decision. On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for a continuance. Specifically, the respondent argues that his prior counsel failed to inform him of his obligation to file his application for relief.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is considered to have abandoned his claim because he failed to timely file his application for relief from removal (I.J. at 3-4). An Immigration Judge has broad discretion to conduct removal proceedings and to set time limits and extensions for filing applications. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). In this case, the respondent’s counsel was advised by the Immigration Judge that the application for relief was required to be filed at the next hearing (Tr. at 6). Moreover, as shown above, proceedings in this matter had been delayed to allow the respondent ample time to prepare for his merits hearing. See Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 350 (BIA 1982) (holding that an Immigration Judge has a duty to determine removability in an expeditious manner and to avoid dilatory tactics designed to delay removal proceedings). To the extent that the respondent alleges that his former counsel engaged in ineffective assistance, we note that the respondent has not attempted to comply with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly, J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered:
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion To Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 73 Fed. Reg. 76,927, 937-38 (Dec. 18, 2008) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c)(3)(iii), (e)(1)).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 73 Fed. Reg. At 76938 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i)).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maria M. Odom, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joy Lampley Fortson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(C), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(C)º - Convicted of firearms or destructive device violation
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a 37-year-old native and citizen of Mexico, appealed the Immigration Judge’s September 19, 2007, decision denying his motion to reopen to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The respondent’s attorney’s motion to withdraw was granted on February 26, 2007. On March 20, 2007, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable, as charged, and that he had abandoned any applications for relief. Through a new attorney, he filed a motion to reopen on June 13, 2007, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal was remanded by the Board on May 22, 2008, to the Immigration Court so that the record file could be located. The record was located and returned to the Board on August 19, 2009. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent was admitted to the United States on or about December 1, 1990, as a lawful permanent resident. He married a citizen of Mexico on February 24, 2002, in Mexico. They have five United States citizen children ages 19, 16, 11, 10 and 6 years old. He was convicted in Cobb County, Georgia, on or about June 3, 1997, on a plea of guilty of carrying a concealed weapon. He was fined and given a 12 month suspended sentence. The Notice to Appear was issued on April 11, 2005, at the border after he had made a trip to Mexico. His request for a change of venue from San Antonio, Texas, to Atlanta, Georgia, was granted on March 8, 2006. The respondent contended in his motion to reopen that his original counsel was ineffective by not pursuing his application under 240A(a) of the Act, and that the record should be reopened and remanded. The Immigration Judge found no ineffective assistance of counsel had been proven, and that the motion should be denied.
 
The respondent has not complied substantially with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). He submitted a copy of the agreement for representation, which was limited to the initial appearance, and he has informed prior counsel that he intended to make a claim of ineffective assistance to the Board. Former counsel has responded. However, the respondent did not file any complaint with the relevant authorities. He explains in his brief that the situation, in his new counsel’s opinion, does not warrant a bar complaint. If the respondent does not believe a bar complaint is warranted, he also cannot claim that the actions of his former counsel rise to the level of ineffective assistance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Compean, Bangaly and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009).
 
*2 Moreover, ineffective assistance of counsel in an immigration proceeding is a denial of due process only “¿iºf the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from presenting his case.” Ramirez-Durazo v. INS, 794 F.2d 491, 499-500 (9th Cir. 1986) (quoting Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1985). See also Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent must show that the conduct of former counsel was so egregious that it rendered his hearing unfair. Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998). The respondent stated in his affidavit that he was unable to pay former counsel the amount counsel wanted to continue his representation and file the application. He implies that the amount demanded was excessive, but he does not believe it merits the attention of the state bar. He also states that counsel apparently did not inform the Immigration Court of his new address, because the judge’s order was sent to his old address in North Carolina. Counsel’s motion to withdraw informs the court of the respondent’s new address in Georgia. He does not state that the use of his former address by the Immigration Court caused him any prejudice. We note that the respondent admits his former attorney advised him to attend his hearing scheduled for March 23, 2007, and to request additional time to find a new attorney. He did not appear at that time, even though he could not yet have received the Immigration Judge’s order of removal. We find that there has been no showing that the respondent was prejudiced by his prior attorney’s performance. See Dakane v. United States Attorney General, 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005). In these circumstances, we find the respondent’s due process rights have not been violated.
 
The respondent complains that the Immigration Judge did not consider him for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), but he has not made a prima facia case of eligibility. Primarily, he has not filed an affidavit indicating that he is able and willing to post bond and to leave the United States, if so ordered. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(3); 1240.26(c)(iv).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dominique J. Honea
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled

APPLICATIONS: Removability; reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 11, 2009. Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), as an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. Based upon a Verification of Removal (Exh. 7), the Immigration Judge made a factual finding that the respondent departed the United States on May 22, 2004, after being ordered removed (I.J. at 4), and this factual finding is not clearly erroneous. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). Applying a de novo standard of review, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has failed to meet his burden of proving his lawful re-entry to the United States. See Lopez-Rodriguez v. Mukasey, 536 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir. 2008) (advising that once DHS establishes identity and alienage, the burden shifts to the respondent to prove time, place, and manner of entry).
 
Based upon evidence of the respondent’s 2003 conviction for possession or use of drug paraphernalia (Exh. 4-B), we further affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is inadmissible under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation. See Matter of Martinez-Espinoza, 25 I&N Dec. 118 (BIA 2009).
 
The respondent focuses his arguments on appeal on his request for reopening based upon a claim that prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance by filing a deficient motion to reopen his prior removal proceeding following the March 9, 2002, issuance of an in absentia order of removal. The Immigration Judge denied that motion on April 2, 2002, and the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of that decision on July 2, 2003.
 
*2 The respondent’s request for reopening fails. First, the respondent’s 2004 removal from the United States pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s 2002 in absentia order of removal acted to strip us and the Immigration Judge of authority to reopen prior removal proceedings, whether on the respondent’s motion or sua sponte. See Matter of Armendarez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008) (declining to follow Lin v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2007)). Second, the respondent has not attempted to comply with the procedure set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrew L. Friedman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kori LaPoint
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated February 21, 2008. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the record of proceeding and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on May 8, 2007, pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5) (I.J. at 3-4). The respondent’s appeal will be sustained, and the record of proceeding will be remanded for further proceedings. See Matter of Patel, 16 I&N Dec. 600 (BIA 1978) (“¿Rºemand is effective for the stated purpose and for consideration of any and all matters which the ¿ immigration judgeº deems appropriate in the exercise of his administrative discretion or which are brought to his attention in compliance with the appropriate regulations.”). The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7) (2009); Matter of Lodge, 19 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 1987) (“Oral argument is heard at the discretion of the Board and will not be granted unless the party appealing has specified the reasons for the appeal in some meaningful fashion.”).
 
The facts as presented for the Immigration Judge’s consideration in the respondent’s motion to reopen and the Department of Homeland Security’s opposition (“DHS”) and as relevant to this appeal are as follows: The DHS personally served the respondent with the Notice to Appear on August 18, 2006, while the respondent was in DHS custody in San Diego, California (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1 (May 8, 2007)). The Notice to Appear was filed in San Diego Immigration Court on September 1, 2006 (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1 (May 8, 2007)). The respondent was released from the DHS’s custody in San Diego following the posting of a $15,000 surety bond on September 27, 2006 (Exh. 3 (May 8, 2007)). At that time the respondent reported his address following release to the DHS as being in Corona, New York (Exh. 3 (May 8, 2007)).
 
The initial master calendar hearing in these proceedings was originally scheduled for October 3, 2006 (Exh. 2 (May 8, 2007)). However, on October 4, 2006, the respondent’s master calendar hearing was rescheduled for February 6, 2007 (Exh. 4 (May 8, 2007)). On January 9, 2007, the date of the respondent’s first master calendar hearing was rescheduled once again for May 8, 2007 (Exhs. 9 and 10 (May 8, 2007)). The respondent failed to appear on May 8, 2007, for the scheduled master calendar hearing and, accordingly, was ordered removed in absentia on that date (I.J. at 1). The respondent stated in the affidavit submitted in support of the motion to reopen that he received a copy of the in absentia order from the Immigration Court on May 10, 2007 (I.J. at 2; Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1, 2008) at Exh. A ¿respondent’s affidavitº).
 
*2 Meanwhile, the respondent retained private counsel to file a motion to change the venue for these removal proceedings from San Diego, California to New York, New York (I.J. at 2-3; Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1, 2008) at Exh. A ¿ respondent’s affidavitº; Exhs. 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13 and 14 (May 8, 2007)). In all, the private counsel filed four motions for change of venue on the respondent’s behalf, each of which (1) was properly rejected by the Immigration Court staff for failure to comply with the San Diego Immigration Court’s Local Operating Procedures (Exhs. 5, 6, 7 and 8 (May 8, 2007)), (2) was denied by the Immigration Judge for failure to comply with the San Diego Immigration Court’s Local Operating Procedures (Exh. 12 (May 8, 2007)), or, in the case of the final untimely motion for change of venue filed on April 30, 2007 (Exh. 13 (May 8, 2007)), (3) had prompted the Immigration Judge to provide advanced, written notice to the respondent’s privately retained counsel (but not to the respondent personally) that “¿yºou are given to understand that it may be that the motion will not be granted,” and that the respondent “should therefore be prepared to appear in person on hearing day and be ready to proceed (I.J. at 3; Exh. 14 (May 8, 2007)).”
 
Subsequent to the entry of the May 8, 2007, in absentia removal order, the respondent received a correspondence from the DHS, Notice to Deliver Alien (Form 1-340), dated January 4, 2008, directing him to appear for removal in San Diego, California on February 5, 2008 (I.J. at 2; Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1,2008) at Exh. A ¿respondent’s affidavitº and Exh. J ¿Notice to Deliver Alien º). The DHS’s correspondence induced the respondent to retain present counsel of record who filed the underlying motion to reopen on the respondent’s behalf on February 1, 2008 (I.J. at 2; Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1, 2008) at Exh. A ¿ respondent’s affidavitº). On February 7, 2008, the DHS filed a memorandum in opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen, to which the respondent replied on February 15, 2008 (I.J. at 3).
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is predicated on a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 2-3; Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1, 2008)). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In our view, the Immigration Judge correctly concluded that the actions of the respondent’s former counsel in repeatedly filing procedurally deficient motions for change of venue and, most of all, in advising the respondent without any evident justification in fact or law not to appear for the May 8, 2007, master calendar hearing constituted ineffective assistance and, therefore, “exceptional circumstances” (theoretically) warranting rescission of the in absentia removal order (I.J. at 3). See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i), (e)(1) of the Act (defining “exceptional circumstances”); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, 509 (BIA 1996) (“¿Wºe note that one must look to the “totality of circumstances” to resolve this issue of exceptional circumstances.”); see also Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 938 (9th Cir. 2003); Aris v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 599 (2d Cir. 2008) (“We now join our sister circuits in concluding that, under BIA precedent applicable to the pre-1996 version of the INA as well as its current iteration, a lawyer’s inaccurate advice to his client concerning an immigration hearing date can constitute ‘exceptional circumstances’ excusing the alien’s failure to appear at a deportation hearing ¿º and meriting the reopening of an in absentia deportation order ¿º.” (citing Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 798, 801-02 (5th Cir. 2007); Lo v. Ashcroft, supra; Twum v. INS, 411 F.3d 54, 59 n. 4 (2d Cir. 2005)); Matter of Grijalva, supra (“An order of deportation issued following a hearing conducted in absentia may be rescinded under section 242B(c)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3)(Supp. V 1993), where an alien properly establishes that his failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel which amounts to “exceptional circumstances” within the meaning of section 242B(f)(2) of the Act.”).
 
*3 The Immigration Judge nevertheless denied the respondent’s motion to reopen on the grounds that it was untimely and, in considering the applicability of equitable tolling to the respondent’s motion to reopen, determined that the doctrine does not apply in this case because the respondent failed to submit “conclusive proof” that the respondent retained the first private attorney subsequent to the entry of the in absentia order of removal on May 8, 2007, for the purpose of preparing and filing a motion to reopen the record of proceeding and rescind the in absentia order of removal (I.J. at 4; Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1, 2008) at Exh. A ¿respondent’s affidavitº).
 
The respondent does not dispute that the motion to reopen filed on February 1, 2008, is untimely. Thus, the sole issue is whether the doctrine of equitable tolling should be invoked in order to toll the 180-day filing deadline for motions to reopen the record of proceeding and rescind the in absentia removal order based on “exceptional circumstances” arising from the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir. 2003). Although this is a close case, we conclude that it should.
 
In concluding that the doctrine of equitable tolling should not be invoked, the Immigration Judge credited a letter from the respondent’s former counsel submitted by the DHS in opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen on February 7, 2008 (I.J. at 4). While the respondent claimed to have paid the former attorney a separate fee of $300.00 to file the motion to reopen shortly after he received the in absentia order in the mail, the former attorney denied this assertion in the letter dated February 6, 2008 (I.J. at 4). Specifically, the letter from the former attorney acknowledged that the respondent arrived at his law office on May 15, 2007, after, according to the respondent’s affidavit, the respondent had received the in absentia removal order on May 10, 2007, in the mail, but the respondent’s former attorney claimed that a payment of $200.00 that he had extracted from the respondent during the May 15, 2007, office visit was applied toward the remaining balance of the $1,200.00 fee that he had charged the respondent to file the (ineffective) motion(s) to change venue in the San Diego Immigration Court (I.J. at 4).
 
For his part, the respondent claims that the former attorney assured him that the entry of the in absentia order was an “error” when he visited his office after receiving the in absentia order in the mail (Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1, 2008) at Exh. A ¿respondent’s affidavitº). The respondent further claims that the former attorney failed to apprise him of the four procedurally defective motions to change venue that he had filed on the respondent’s behalf and that he only became aware of these defective motions after he retained present counsel of record and was able to obtain a copy of his file from the former attorney on January 29, 2008 (Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1,2008) at Exh. A ¿ respondent’s affidavitº). The respondent’s former attorney failed to acknowledge, much less address, these serious allegations of on-going ineffective assistance of counsel extending beyond the entry of the in absentia removal order in the letter submitted by the DHS on February 7, 2008 (I.J. at 3; The DHS’s Opposition to the Respondent’s M.T.R. at Exh. B).
 
*4 We conclude that the respondent has provided sufficient evidence in support of the motion to reopen the record of proceeding to warrant reopening and rescission of the in absentia removal order dated May 8, 2007. And we disagree with the weight the Immigration Judge accorded the letter from the respondent’s former attorney dated February 6, 2008, proffered by the DHS in opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen, which is the only evidence in the record of proceeding invoked by the Immigration Judge in support of the conclusion that the equitable tolling doctrine does not apply under these facts (I.J. at 4). See Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008).
 
First, the assertion made by the respondent’s former attorney that he was not aware of the entry of the in absentia order dated May 8, 2007, until June 25, 2007, is highly dubious (I.J. at 3; The DHS’s Opposition to the Respondent’s M.T.R. at Exh. B). The fourth and final motion for change of venue the former attorney filed on the respondent’s behalf on April 30, 2007, reflects that he was aware of the hearing scheduled for May 8, 2007 (I.J. at 2; Exh. 13 (May 8, 2007)). Furthermore, the Immigration Judge wrote to the respondent’s former attorney on May 1, 2007, in response to that motion that “¿yºou are given to understand that it may be that the motion will not be granted,” and that the respondent “should therefore be prepared to appear in person on hearing day and be ready to proceed (I.J. at 3; Exh. 14 (May 8, 2007)).” Accordingly, we can see no reasonable explanation in the record of proceeding for the former attorney’s claimed ignorance of the entry of the in absentia removal order on May 8, 2007 (I.J. at 3; The DHS’s Opposition to the Respondent’s M.T.R. at Exh. B).
 
Second, the letter from the former attorney is silent on the most serious allegation of professional misconduct levied against him in this case, that is, that he instructed the respondent not to appear at the May 8, 2007, master calendar hearing after receiving the Immigration Judge’s May 1, 2008, correspondence directing the respondent to appear (I.J. at 3; Respondent’s M.T.R. (Feb. 1, 2008) at Exh. A ¿respondent’s affidavitº); Exh. 14 (May 8, 2007)). Third, it is noteworthy that the respondent’s former attorney freely admits to accepting $200.00 from the respondent on May 15, 2007, for the provision of services that he never effectively provided after filing four procedurally defective motions for change of venue (I.J. at 4; The DHS’s Opposition to the Respondent’s M.T.R. at Exh. B).
 
We conclude that the respondent’s actions before and after the entry of the in absentia removal order exhibited a reasonable level of diligence under the circumstances; he promptly retained counsel after his release from the DHS’s custody; the action for which he retained counsel, obtaining a change of venue, was the correct initial step in fulfilling his appearance obligations in these proceedings and, after this necessary initial step failed to be carried out by the respondent’s former attorney, there is no convincing explanation that we can see on this record for the former attorney’s professed ignorance of the entry of the in absentia removal order on May 8, 2007, or the former attorney’s failure to take any step(s) to apprise and assist his client, the respondent, after the in absentia order’s entry. We therefore conclude that the respondent’s motion to reopen should be granted. Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
*5 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen the record of proceeding and rescind the in absentia order of removal dated May 8, 2007, is granted. The record of proceeding is remanded for further proceedings.
 
Board Member Filppu respectfully concurs in the result. The Immigration Judge wrongly demanded “conclusive proof” that the respondent contracted with prior counsel for the filing of a motion to rescind the in absentia order. Given the totality of the evidence, the respondent met the “high standard” set by Congress for a showing of exceptional circumstances. See Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33, 34 (BIA 1998); section 240(c)(4)(A) and (B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Francisco J. Alvillar, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John Donovan
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondents have appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 17, 2008, denying their motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondents removed in absentia for their failure to appear for the hearing on August 9, 1994. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). The Board should defer to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493, 496 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500, 501 (BIA 2008).
 
On appeal the respondents contend that the government did not demonstrate proper notice or deportability by “clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence,” as required by former section 242B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b.
 
As the respondents’ deportation proceedings are governed by former section 242B of the Act, we apply the case of Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995) (Board held that a hearing notice which is sent by certified mail to the alien’s last known address is sufficient to establish by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the alien received written notice of the deportation hearing within the meaning of section 242B(c)(1) of the Act). The record reflects that on May 27, 1994, the Houston Immigration Court sent a separate notice of hearing by certified mail to each of the respondents at their last known address of 1550 Blalock, Apt. #161, Houston, TX 77080. Therefore, it is clear that the respondents received notice pursuant to Matter of Grijalva, supra. We held further that there “is no requirement that the certified mail return receipt be signed by the alien or a responsible person at his address to effect service.” Id. at 34. In this case, in the record of proceedings there is a signed return receipt card for each notice of hearing sent to the respondents. A notice of hearing dated May 27, 1994, was sent to respondent, Julia Ana Resendez-Gonzalez (AXXX XXX XXX), at her last known address. The receipt for certified mail is attached to the copy of the hearing notice in the record and indicates the postmark date of “05/27/94.” The corresponding return receipt card signed by “Julia A. Gonzalez” indicates the date of delivery as “5/31/94.” The record of proceedings contains the same documentation for the other two respondents. The return receipt card for the hearing notice sent to respondent Judith Ariana Gonzales-Resendez (AXXX XXX XXX) is signed by “Julia A. Gonzalez” and indicates the date of delivery as “5/31/94,” and the return receipt card for the hearing notice sent to respondent Julia Ana Gonzales-Resendez (AXXX XXX XXX) is signed by Jorge Gonzalez and indicates the date of delivery as “6/1/94.” Similarly, the article numbers on the receipts for certified mail match the article numbers on the signed return receipt cards, which are attached to the corresponding notices of hearing in the record of proceedings. The record clearly reflects that the return receipt cards specifically pertain to the notices of hearing, as they were all sent by the Office of the Immigration Judge in Houston, Texas, and they are all postmarked May 27, 1994, the same date as the hearing notices.¿FN1º
 
*2 The respondents argue that the notices of hearing were sent directly to the respondents, and that their former attorney, Juan Reyes, Esquire, was not provided with copies of the notices of hearing. However, the record does not contain a Notice of Entry or Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28), which would indicate that the respondents were represented by an attorney or representative before the Immigration Court. Therefore, the Houston Immigration Court was only required to send notices of hearing to the respondents. The lead respondent and her spouse, Jorge Gonzales, state in their affidavits that they did not understand the certified letters so they sent them to Mr. Reyes. They further indicate that in 1998, their attorney informed them that they had an order of deportation against them. We note that the respondents have not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel for their failure to appear at the hearing. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). In light of the documentary evidence in the record that the notices of hearing were sent by certified mail through the U.S. Postal Service to the respondents’ last known address and there is proof of delivery of the notices of hearing, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondents received proper notice of the hearing and they have failed to overcome the strong presumption of effective service.
 
The respondents also assert that the government did not establish by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the respondents were deportable because they had been issued border crossing cards and were crossing the United States/Mexico border legally during 1994. They contend that the existence of the border crossing cards at the time of the allegedly illegal entry demonstrates that the government could not have met their burden of proof. However, the Orders to Show Cause reflect that the respondents were charged with entering the United States without inspection in 1986. In the in absentia orders dated August 9, 1994, the Immigration Judge found that during the hearing, “service of the Order to Show Cause upon the respondent was confirmed, and deportability on the identified charge(s) established by ‘clear, convincing, and unequivocal’ evidence which has been received to the record of proceedings.” An Immigration Judge may receive into evidence any oral or written statement which is material and relevant to any issue in the case made by the alien or any other person during any investigation or examination. Such evidence may be admitted as long as it is probative and its use is fundamentally fair so as not to violate due process standards. Form I-213 is a record which is routinely prepared by the Department of Homeland (DHS) officers as a summary of information obtained at the time of the initial processing of an individual suspected of being an alien unlawfully present in the United States. Espinoza v. INS, 45 F.3d 308 (9th Cir. 1995). Courts have recognized the inherent trustworthiness attributable to “public records or reports” such as Form I-213. Id.; see also Matter of Gomez-Gomez, 23 I&N Dec. 522 (BIA 2002). Form I-213 is frequently offered into evidence at deportation and removal hearings, and we have noted its admissibility. Id. In his decision denying the respondents’ motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge found it unnecessary to address the respondents’ contention that they entered the United States with border crossing cards, noting that this argument was not presented to the trial court and the presiding Immigration Judge was unaware of the existence of border crossing cards.
 
*3 The respondents have submitted additional evidence on appeal. The Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). The record supports the finding that the respondents had notice of their hearing. Accordingly, the respondents’ appeal is dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ appeal is dismissed.

All the return receipt cards for the notices of hearing have the pre-printed ‘Office of the Immigration Judge’ in Houston, Texas, as the return address. In contrast, the Orders to Show Cause were sent by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the government’s return address would appear on the return receipt cards for the Orders to Show Cause.
