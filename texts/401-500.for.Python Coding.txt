IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Larry E. Adkison, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Musto
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)] - Entered U.S. without inspection
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 18, 2011, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen deportation proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was granted voluntary departure in lieu of deportation on January 10, 1997, and waived appeal (I.J. at 1). On April 3, 1997, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge based on ineffective assistance of counsel, which was denied on April 22, 1997. The respondent appealed the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion and the Board dismissed his appeal on December 14, 2001, finding he did not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and he did not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s alleged errors (BIA at 1-2). The respondent filed the present motion on March 15, 2011 with the Immigration Judge, alleging the same basis for reopening: namely, ineffective assistance of counsel of his first attorney as well as the attorney who filed an appeal with the Board and a subsequent attorney who was allegedly retained approximately 7 years after the respondent was ordered deported.
 
The respondent does not dispute the fact that his motion is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (a motion to reopen any case previously the subject of a final administrative order must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision). Rather, the respondent argues that his untimely filing should be equitably tolled because he received ineffective assistance of former counsel(s). But to benefit from equitable tolling, a respondent must show that he exercised due diligence and that he could not have reasonably been expected to file his motion earlier. See El-Gazawy v. Holder, 690 F.3d 852, 859 (7th Cir. 2012); Johnson v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 795, 799 (7th Cir. 2007) (stating that “[i]t is a rare occasion that we reverse a decision on the basis that a time limit should have been equitably tolled . . . it must be shown that the claimant could not have been expected to file earlier.”).
 
*2 Assuming that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated that equitable tolling applies, as he has not shown due diligence in pursuing his claim (I.J. at 2). As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent was aware of the possibility of ineffective assistance, as his second attorney raised this issue in her brief before the Board in August 1997 (I.J. at 2). The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal in 2001, and the respondent has offered no reasonable explanation for waiting more than 9 years from the date of the Board’s final decision in this case to file the present motion. Thus, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated that he acted with due diligence in pursuing his alleged ineffective assistance of counsel claim.1
 
The record reflects that the respondent is the beneficiary of an approved visa petition, has been married to a United States citizen since January 1997, and has a child with his wife (Respondent’s March 15, 2011 Motion, tabs A, C, D). Moreover, the respondent has submitted medical records that indicate that he has been diagnosed with serious cardiovascular issues (Respondent’s March 15, 2011 Motion, tab U). To the extent that the respondent requests sua sponte reopening to apply for adjustment of status based on exceptional circumstances, we note that becoming eligible for relief from deportation after a final administrative order has been entered, as the respondent has done, is common and does not, in itself, constitute an exceptional circumstance warranting our consideration of an untimely motion. To hold otherwise would vitiate the statutory and regulatory deadlines, which are designed to bring finality to immigration proceedings. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992) (motions to reopen are especially disfavored in immigration proceedings because every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien).
 
Moreover, we note that even assuming the respondent presents exceptional circumstances, we would decline to exercise our sua sponte authority, as the record does not indicate that the respondent is statutorily eligible for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), as he conceded that he entered without inspection (Exh. 1; Tr. at 11-12). Section 245(a) of the Act. Moreover, the record also does not indicate that the respondent is statutorily eligible for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act, because although the respondent claims that he is grandfathered under section 245(i) of the Act, the I-130 in the record reflects a priority date of July 5, 2009, and no other visa petition appears in the administrative record (Respondent’s March 15, 2011 Motion at tabs B & E). See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.10(a)(1), (3). As such, we conclude that the circumstances that the respondent described would not warrant reopening on a sua sponte basis. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

We note that although the respondent alleges that the Immigration Judge in the original proceedings gave the respondent’s first attorney “““misleading directions” as to where to file the visa petition (Form I-130) (Respondent’s Br. at 2), a review of the transcript reveals that this assertion is without merit (Tr. at 13-15).

File: AXXX XX8 060 - Oklahoma City, OK
June 13, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margaret M. Price
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed an Immigration Judge’s January 24, 2012, decision which granted the respondent “pre-conclusion” voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). The respondent now maintains that she was provided ineffective assistance of counsel and requests a remand. The appeal will be dismissed.1
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error; but we review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals before us, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
To be eligible for pre-conclusion voluntary departure, a respondent must concede removability and waive any right to appeal that decision. Section 240B(a) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D); see also Matter of Ocampo, 22 I&N Dec. 1301 (BIA 2000).
 
The respondent’s removability is not in dispute. The Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure in lieu of having a full hearing on the merits, as the respondent indicated that she understood and sought this form of relief (Tr. at 12-13). Although the respondent may have been uncertain, at first, about the requirements to obtain this form of voluntary departure, she then specifically indicated that she was asking for this relief, accepted that the Immigration Judge’s decision would be final, and agreed to waive appeal (Tr. at 12-14). She stated that she understood that accepting the Immigration Judge’s decision meant she had to prepare to leave the country (Tr. at 13-14).
 
On appeal, the respondent now maintains that she wished to pursue other unstated relief. She avers that because of a fee dispute with her former attorney, the attorney improperly acceded to voluntary departure for the respondent in addition to waiving appeal. We note, however, that the respondent does not directly dispute that she, herself, agreed to depart voluntarily and to the appeal waiver (Tr. at 12-13). Although she asserts she does not speak English, she did not--and has not--objected to the translation which was provided at the hearing. In light of the respondent’s direct answers to the Immigration Judge on these issues, we find that the respondent’s waiver of appeal was knowing and intelligent.2 See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000).
 
*2 The respondent has also not attempted to explain in any meaningful detail the nature of her alleged dispute with her former attorney, including what the attorney agreed to do. While we recognize that the respondent is now appearing pro se, to successfully show ineffective assistance of counsel, she would need to specify the nature of her agreement with former counsel, describing in detail what representations counsel may have made. She would also generally be expected to file a complaint with the attorney’s licensing authority or explain why she has not done so. Additionally, the attorney must be afforded an opportunity to respond to her allegations. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent has not attempted to meet any of these criteria for showing ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, the respondent has not specified what other relief counsel was to have sought for her, nor whether she may actually be eligible for any other relief. Thus, she has not shown that she was prejudiced by her former counsel’s actions. See, e.g., Ochieng v. Mukasey, 520 F.3d 1110, 1115 (10th Cir. 2008) (showing of prejudice necessary to succeed on ineffective assistance of counsel claim). Consequently, remanding the record would serve no apparent purpose.
 
In light of the foregoing, the Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of her right to appeal. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a)(1) (final sentence), 1003.39 (finality of order); Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, supra; Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). As the respondent waived appeal, we have no further jurisdiction in this matter. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.

File: AXXX XX4 037 - Newark, NJ
June 13, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marilyn Labrada Dume, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, mailed August 24, 2012, denying her timely motion to reopen. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent seeks to reopen these removal proceedings to pursue an application for adjustment of status of status under section 245(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion because she has not demonstrated that she is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status (I.J. at 1). See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Sevoian v. Ashcroft, 290 F.3d 166, 170, 174 (3d Cir. 2002). In particular, the respondent has not demonstrated that she is a “grandfathered alien” for purposes of section 245(i) of the Act. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.10(a)(1)(i).
 
The respondent has presented evidence that her biological father was admitted to this country as an “F-24” lawful permanent resident (unmarried son or daughter (21 years of age or older) of a lawful permanent resident alien) in 1992 (Respondent’s Motion at 6, 9). See United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Adjudicator’s Field Manual, Appendix 23-7: Class of Admission under the Immigrant Laws, available online at http:// www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/AFM/HTML/AFM/0-0-0-1.html. While not clear, the admission of the respondent’s biological father as an F-24 in 1992 tends to indicate that he was the beneficiary of an immigrant visa petition filed on or before April 30, 2001. However, the respondent has not demonstrated that, within the meaning of section 101(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1), she was considered a derivative beneficiary “child” of the immigrant visa petition. For example, she does not claim that she was born in wedlock, legitimated in accordance with Dominican law, or, prior to her 21st birthday, shared a bona fide father / child relationship with her biological father. See sections 101(b)(1)(A), (C), (D) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(d)(2); Matter of Cabrera, 21 I&N Dec. 589, 591-92 (1996) (“Thus, a child residing or domiciled in the Dominican Republic may qualify as a legitimated child under section 101(b)(1)(C) [of the Act] as soon as his father acknowledges paternity in accordance with Dominican law.”); Matter of Vizcaino, 19 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1988); Matter of Annang, 14 I&N Dec. 502 (BIA 1973) (holding that the content of foreign law is a question of fact that must be proven by the party relying on it).
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent claims that the attorney who represented her before the Immigration Judge provided her with ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to address her eligibility for adjustment of status, we observe that the respondent has not complied with the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), nor established that she was prejudiced by her former counsel’s handling of this matter. Accordingly, we will not disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. The following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX4 779 - San Diego, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John David Mansfield, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
J.L. Woodmansee
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on April 11, 2002, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider and reopen. On April 15, 2013, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order entered against him. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a brief opposing the respondent’s motion, and, on June 3, 2013, the respondent filed a response to the Department of Homeland Security’s opposition. The respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind will be denied.
  
I. MOTION TO RESCIND
 
Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), states that an in absentia order may be rescinded “upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (e)(1)).”1 The Immigration Judge entered an in absentia order of removal against the respondent on October 11, 2000. The respondent, however, did not file his current motion to rescind until 12 ½ years later. The respondent’s motion to rescind based on exceptional circumstances therefore is untimely.
 
In addition, the regulations pertaining to the filing of motions to rescind in absentia orders entered in removal proceedings state that an alien may only file one motion to rescind. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent filed a motion to rescind with the Immigration Judge on January 8, 2001. The Immigration Judge denied this motion on February 26, 2001, and we upheld the Immigration Judge’s decision on August 22, 2001. The respondent’s current motion to rescind therefore is the respondent’s second motion of this type and is numerically barred.
 
The respondent claims in his motion that the time and numeric limits for filing motions to rescind should be equitably tolled because he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. He contends that his first attorney, Thomas Mix, did not remind him of his hearing on October 11, 2000, and therefore was responsible for his failure to appear. The respondent also contends that his attempts to rectify and explain this situation were compromised by the ineffective representation of his subsequent attorney, Manuel Gonzalez. The respondent has submitted copies of complaints that he claims to have filed against each of these attorneys with the relevant disciplinary authorities. The respondent also has submitted a declaration and a supplemental declaration, documentation pertaining to his eligibility for adjustment of status, and the prior rulings in his case.
 
*2 The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the circuit in which the respondent’s case arises, has held that equitable tolling of the time limit for a motion to reopen is available “when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error.” See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir. 2003); see also Fajardo v. INS, 300 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2002) (stating that the 180-day deadline for filing a motion to rescind an in absentia order based on a claim of exceptional circumstances can be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance of an attorney or a non-attorney). The Ninth Circuit further has indicated that it considered three issues in determining whether an alien exercised due diligence: (1) if and when a reasonable person in the alien’s position would suspect the specific fraud or error underlying her petition, (2) whether the alien took reasonable steps to investigate the suspected fraud or error or, if the alien was unaware of the error, to pursue relief, and (3) when the alien definitively learned of the harm resulting from counsel’s deficiency. Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 680 (9th Cir. 2011).
 
In this case, the respondent has not presented sufficient evidence to establish that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the time or numeric limits on his motion to rescind. In particular, the respondent has not met the procedural requirements necessary for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not presented sufficient evidence to establish that ineffective assistance of counsel caused the entry of the in absentia order against him or prevented him from obtaining rescission, and he has not established that he has acted diligently in discovering any ineffective assistance or in pursuing relief.
  
A. Matter of Lozada Requirements
 
To obtain reopening on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must meet certain procedural requirements. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). These requirements also are applicable to the respondent’s situation. Cf. Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec 472 (BIA 1996) (finding that, under former statute, alien met exceptional circumstances requirement when he established that his failure to appear was due to ineffective assistance of counsel). The respondent, however, has not met these requirements for either of his former attorneys.
 
The respondent has discussed his arrangement with Mr. Mix in the declaration he submitted with his motion, and he has submitted a bar complaint against Mr. Mix which he claims to have filed with the relevant authorities. Nevertheless, the respondent has not offered evidence to establish that he has notified Mr. Mix of the charges against him or explained why he is unable to do so.2
 
*3 Further, the respondent has not presented an affidavit setting forth his agreement with his second attorney, Mr. Gonzalez. The bar complaint the respondent claims to have filed against Mr. Gonzalez contains vague statements regarding their agreement, and the record contains an entry of appearance Mr. Gonzalez filed with the DHS in 2006, but this information is not sufficient to establish that the respondent retained Mr. Gonzalez to represent him for any purpose before the immigration courts or this Board. See, e.g., Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding that erroneous advice received outside and in advance of immigration proceedings did not affect fairness of proceedings and did not provide basis for reopening due to ineffective assistance of counsel); cf. Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893, 896 (9th Cir. 2008) (finding attorney-client arrangement evident from on the record appearances). In addition, the respondent has not presented evidence to indicate that he has attempted to notify Mr. Gonzalez of the charges he is making against him.3 The respondent therefore has not submitted sufficient evidence to establish that he has met the procedural requirements necessary to make a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
  
B. Ineffective Assistance
 
Moreover, even if we were to conclude that the respondent has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, supra, the respondent has not submitted sufficient evidence to establish that the ineffective assistance of his former attorneys led to the entry of the in absentia order or his inability to obtain rescission of this order. The respondent now claims that he did not appear at his hearing on October 11, 2000, because Mr Mix’s office did not remind him of his hearing date.4 This claim, however, conflicts with the statement he submitted with a motion to reopen and reconsider filed with this Board on October 9, 2001. In that statement, the respondent said that he did not appear because he mistakenly believed that his hearing was the following week and his father did not remind him of the correct hearing date until it was too late for him to appear in court.
 
The respondent has attempted to explain the discrepancies in his statements by submitting an additional declaration. See Respondent’s Reply to DHS’ Opposition to Respondent’s Motion To Reopen Removal Proceedings. In this most recent statement, the respondent claims that he did not read the statement that Mr. Mix’ assistant gave him to sign in 2001, and he appears to allege that the assistant was trying to shift the blame for respondent’s non-appearance from herself to the respondent’s father.
 
Even if we accept the respondent’s most recent statement as true, the record shows that the respondent received both oral and written notice of his hearing date and of the consequences for failing to appear from the Immigration Judge (I.J. 2/26/01 at 6). The respondent therefore had sufficient information to allow him to appear in court as required, and he bears some responsibility for not appearing or for not contacting his attorney to ask if he was required to appear. The information of record is not sufficient to establish that the oversight or error of Mr Mix’s office amounted to ineffective assistance.
 
*4 In addition, the respondent has not provided sufficient information regarding the duties Mr. Gonzalez owed to him to establish that any errors on the part of Mr. Gonzalez constituted ineffective assistance. The bar complaints the respondent has prepared against Mr. Mix and Mr. Gonzalez indicate that the respondent only worked with Mr. Gonzalez from 2006 to 2007, and they do not contain sufficient information to establish what Mr. Gonzalez was supposed to accomplish for the respondent during that time. The respondent therefore has not met his burden of establishing that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel in his immigration proceedings.
  
C. Due Diligence
 
Finally, even if we were to conclude that the respondent had met the Lozada requirements and established that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel that affected the outcome of his proceedings, the respondent has not addressed the issue of due diligence in his motion. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra (indicating that, to obtain equitable tolling of a filing deadline, an alien must act with due diligence in discovering the fraud or error that led to missing the deadline). The respondent states in his March 11, 2013, declaration that Mr. Mix called him on October 11, 2000, after he failed to appear for the hearing, but he does not state what steps he then took to address the alleged error on the part of this attorney or to pursue relief. Further, the record shows that Mr. Mix filed a motion to rescind with the Immigration Judge on January 9, 2001, and that the Immigration Judge denied the motion on February 26, 2001. Mr. Mix appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision and then filed a motion to reconsider with this Board. The documents that Mr. Mix submitted to the Immigration Judge and this Board indicated that the respondent had failed to appear due to a mistake on the respondent’s part. At some point during this process, the respondent should have become aware of the representations Mr. Mix was making on his behalf. The respondent, however, has not explained adequately why he waited until 2013 to file a motion to rescind based on the ineffective assistance of Mr. Mix and Mr. Gonzalez. The respondent therefore has not met his burden of establishing that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the deadline for filing a motion to rescind based on exceptional circumstances.
  
II. SUA SPONTE REOPENING
 
We further find that the respondent has not presented sufficient evidence to establish that reopening pursuant to our sua sponte authority is appropriate. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that our discretion to reopen sua sponte is limited to cases where exceptional circumstances are demonstrated). Due to the passage of time, the respondent now is eligible for an exception to the inadmissibility ground contained in section 212(a)(9)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(C)(i). See section 212(a)(9)(C)(ii) of the Act. The respondent, however, has not established that the Secretary of Homeland Security has consented to his reapplying for admission. Id. The respondent therefore remains statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status, the relief he is seeking in reopened proceedings, and reopening to allow him to pursue this relief is not warranted. Cf. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-73 (BIA 1992) (indicating that motions to reopen are disfavored and that this Board may deny reopening when an alien has not established prima facie eligibility for the relief he is seeking). We therefore decline to reopen the respondent’s proceedings pursuant to our sua sponte authority.
 
*5 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind is denied.

Section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act also states that an in absentia order may be rescinded at any time if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive proper notice of his hearing. The respondent has not claimed a lack of notice, and the Immigration Judge found that the respondent received both oral and written notice of the hearing at which he failed to appear (I.J. 2/26/01 at 6).

2

The respondent does state in the bar complaint he claims to have filed against Mr. Gonzalez that Mr. Mix became ill in 2006. The respondent, however, has not offered any other information about Mr. Mix’s situation and has not indicated that illness or other circumstances have prevented him from notifying Mr. Mix of the charges.

Our records indicate that Mr. Gonzalez was suspended from appearing before the Board and the immigration courts for 60 days as of June 15, 2011. The respondent therefore might not need to satisfy the notice requirement set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, supra.

4

The respondent’s statement signed on March 11, 2013, and submitted with his current motion also contains internal inconsistencies. The respondent first states that he did not receive a call from his former attorney’s office to remind him of his hearing and he completely forgot about the hearing due to the stress he was under at the time. The respondent then states that, because he did not receive a reminder, he reasoned that his hearing must have been for a later date. This second statement implies that the respondent did, in fact, remember his hearing but did not appear because he did not receive a call from his attorney.

IN RE: BENJAMIN ROQUE-SABINO
File: AXXX XX2 383 - Memphis, TN

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jason A. Flora, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William A. Lund
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 5, 2012, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on October 18, 2011. On appeal, the respondent concedes that he received legally sufficient notice of his hearing, as notice was served on his attorney of record, but contends that his failure to appear was due to established exceptional circumstances, the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen for failure to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (I.J. at 3). The respondent cites to decisions from the United States Court of Appeals for the First and Ninth Circuits in support of his assertion that the proceedings should be reopened despite his failure to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. However, such case law is not controlling in the instant matter, which arises in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit; rather, Lozada continues to be controlling. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not met the evidentiary requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and he has failed to establish “exceptional circumstances” for his failure to appear (I.J. at 3). See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996) (holding that an alien seeking to reopen in absentia deportation proceedings based on her unsuccessful communications with her attorney and her alleged non-receipt of notification from her attorney regarding the hearing date did not establish “exceptional circumstances” where she failed to satisfy all of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim set out in Matter of Lozada, supra).
 
Furthermore, we are unpersuaded by the respondent’s assertion that the Immigration Judge erred in not allowing him to supplement his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel before denying his motion to reopen. We note that the motion did not indicate that the respondent intended to file any supplemental evidence, nor has such evidence been submitted on appeal.
 
*2 Finally, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in not reopening his proceedings sua sponte. However, we conclude that the respondent has not established that sua sponte reopening is warranted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Even accepting the respondent’s assertion that his former attorney did not provide him with actual notice of his hearing date, upon consideration of the record as a whole, we hold that he has presented insufficient evidence of circumstances that would justify a discretionary grant of his untimely motion to reopen and the extraordinary remedy of reopening his removal proceedings sua sponte. See, e.g., Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (sua sponte reopening is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Russell L. Marshak, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 15, 2012, denying his motion to reopen his proceeding.1 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the Immigration Judge’s determination of credibility. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The respondent was granted pre-conclusion voluntary departure on November 17, 2011. On February 14, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reopen to allow him to seek adjustment of status. The respondent contends that he would not have accepted voluntary departure if his former attorneys had informed him that he could adjust his status by continuing to take and by passing the English language test required for a visa in his field or by seeking a new Form I-140 in a non-healthcare-related field. Respondent’s application for adjustment of status has been denied three times for lack of a Visa Screen certification because he has not passed the English language exam. Respondent had not taken the test for several years before his hearing, and has not submitted any evidence that he has passed the exam. In making his apparent ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent has not substantially complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Singh v. Holder, 658 F.3d 879, 884 (9th Cir. 2011).
 
Even if, as the respondent contends, we found that the record sufficiently established the respondent’s claim for ineffective assistance without meeting the requirements of Matter of Lozada, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion as he has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for the relief sought (I.J. at 3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); see also Lin v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir. 2004); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). The respondent has not presented an application for adjustment of status or an approved visa petition. The respondent’s claim that he could adjust his status through an, as yet unfiled, visa petition from a different employer is purely speculative and insufficient to warrant reopening his proceedings. We further reject the respondent’s contention that the Immigration Judge ignored the ““““primary basis” for his motion to reopen, that his lack of knowledge of his ““““alternative rights and remedies” prevented him from providing a knowing and intelligent waiver of his appeal rights in accepting pre-conclusion voluntary departure (Br. at 17-19). See section 240B(a) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b). As the respondent was represented by counsel, this argument is properly construed as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as addressed by the Immigration Judge and in this order. Furthermore, as the respondent has not presented any evidence that he is eligible for relief under his “alternative rights and remedies,” we cannot conclude that his lack of information precluded a knowing and intelligent waiver.
 
*2 Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX9 799 - Harlingen, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kyle D. Brown, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Richard I. Newman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 12, 2011, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On May 4, 2011, the Immigration Judge entered an order granting the respondent the privilege of voluntarily departing the United States on or before September 1, 2011. On September 1, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge alleging ineffective assistance by his former counsel and requesting that proceedings be reopened to await adjudication of the U visa petition filed by his wife. On October 12, 2011, the Immigration Judge denied the motion as untimely and declined to exercise his sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings.
 
We are not persuaded that the Immigration Judge’s decision should be reversed. There is no dispute that the respondent’s motion to reopen, which was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge entered his final administrative order, is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1299a(c)(7)(C)(i); see also Matter of Goolcharan, 23 I&N Dec. 5, 8 (BIA 2001) (noting that the date on which a period of voluntary departure expires is inconsequential to the timely filing of a motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge). Moreover, the respondent does not assert that his motion falls within any of the exceptions to the filing deadlines for motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4). Rather, he argues that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled in light of his prior attorney’s ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Br. at 4-8). Alternatively, he argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not reopening proceedings sua sponte (Respondent’s Br. at 8-9).
 
To the extent the respondent requests equitable tolling of the filing deadline, we note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has not addressed in a published decision whether the motion time limitations may be equitably tolled in cases claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 219-220 (5th Cir. 2008) (holding that a request for equitable tolling of a time or number-barred motion to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is “in essence an argument that the BIA should have sua sponte reopened the proceeding based upon the doctrine of equitable tolling”). An alien seeking equitable tolling of a motion to reopen period based on ineffective assistance of counsel must affirmatively demonstrate how he acted with due diligence during the entire period he seeks to toll, and the respondent has not done so. See, e.g., Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127 (2d Cir. 2008); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006). According to the respondent’s affidavit, he raised the issue of his wife’s U visa with his former attorney prior to the May 4, 2011, hearing (Motion to Reopen, Tab 9). The respondent and his wife decided to file a new Form I-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status, on the day of the hearing, which they ultimately did on August 8, 2011 (Id.) The respondent has not explained why he waited more than 100 days after the Immigration Judge entered his decision to retain a new attorney or to seek reopening of his proceedings. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the respondent acted with due diligence during the time he seeks to toll.
 
*2 We note that even if the respondent had shown that he acted with due diligence, he has not sufficiently complied with the evidentiary requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). An alien seeking to establish ineffective assistance of counsel must (1) provide an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts, including a detailed description of the agreement with former counsel, (2) establish that former counsel has been informed of the allegations and provided with an opportunity to respond, and (3) indicate whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authority, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent has not complied with the second and third requirements. There is no evidence that the respondent’s prior attorney has been informed of the specific allegations being made against him or that he has been given an opportunity to respond. Additionally, the respondent has not indicated whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authority or explained why such a complaint has not been filed. Accordingly, the respondent has not established that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s appellate arguments that the Immigration Judge erred in declining to reopening proceedings sua sponte. Immigration Judges may exercise sua sponte authority to reopen in “truly exceptional situations” where the interests of justice would be served. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999). Proceedings will generally not be reopened sua sponte where an alien seeks to pursue relief over which the Board and the Immigration Judges have no jurisdiction. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2009) (declining to reopen and remand proceedings to allow an arriving alien to seek adjustment of status before USCIS). As the Immigration Judge noted, the USCIS has sole jurisdiction over all petitions for U nonimmigrant status. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1). Moreover, the entry of a final order of removal does not preclude the USCIS from adjudicating a petition, and the respondent may request a stay of removal with the USCIS pursuant to 8 CFR § 241.6(a). See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(f)(2)(ii). Accordingly, we will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mary Carmen R. Madrid-Crost, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mark Jebson
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen her removal proceedings, alleging she was the victim of ineffective assistance during her prior proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security opposes reopening. The motion will be denied.
 
The party requesting reopening bears the burden of establishing the existence of new, previously unavailable, and material evidence which would likely affect the outcome of the proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). If an alien alleges reopening is warranted due to ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien must establish that prior counsel’s conduct was deficient, must demonstrate that the deficiencies prejudiced the alien, and must substantially comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
We are not persuaded that reopening is warranted. The respondent’s motion does not substantially comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. Hamid v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 465, 469 (6th Cir. 2003). The respondent has not submitted any evidence regarding whether a complaint was filed with the appropriate disciplinary committee or whether prior counsel has been informed of these allegations. Additionally, the respondent has not submitted her own affidavit. Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980) (noting uncorroborated statements by counsel in a brief or motion do not constitute evidence). As the respondent’s motion does not comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, we do not address the claims that prior counsel’s conduct was deficient or that the respondent was prejudiced.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Denise C. Hochul
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 10, 2013, denying his motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on October 23, 2012. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal the respondent asserts that he did not receive notice of the hearing. The record reflects that the respondent was served by regular mail with a Notice to Appear. The Notice to Appear advised the respondent that he must notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever he changed his address or telephone number during the course of the proceeding. In addition, the record reflects that the respondent appeared pro se at several Mater Calendar Hearings and appeared with his attorney, Stephen K. Tills, at hearings on February 3, 2011, and April 5, 2011. Furthermore, on February 2, 2012, a notice of hearing was sent to the respondent’s attorney, Stephen K. Tills, Esquire. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (stating that whenever an alien is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to the attorney of record). It appears that the respondent failed to stay in contact with his attorney. The record contains a motion to withdraw from Stephen K. Tills, Esquire, filed on April 19, 2012, requesting that he be allowed to withdraw because of lack of communication with the respondent. A notice of hearing was sent to the respondent at his last known address on May 11, 2012. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, finding that the hearing notice was served upon the respondent’s attorney of record.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the notice of hearing provided to the respondent’s attorney of record, at the time, constitutes notice to the respondent. Matter of Barocio, supra. Furthermore, the Immigration Judge properly found that the respondent did not file a change of address with the Immigration Court, nor did he stay in contact with his attorney and provide contact information for himself.
 
*2 Moreover, to the extent the respondent alleges, for the first time, ineffective assistance of former counsel, we find no compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In that case, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned is informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. Here, however, the respondent has failed to even minimally fulfill any of the above-noted requirements. See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46-47 (2d Cir. 2005) (finding that Lozada procedural requirements are reasonable, and that, at a minimum, “substantial, if not exact, compliance” with Lozada is required). Moreover, the respondent has not established prejudice. See Debeatham v. Holder, 602 F.3d 481 (2d Cir. 2010) (an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show prejudice resulting from counsel’s alleged deficiencies). As such, reopening on this basis is not warranted. The respondent has not established any other exceptional circumstance for his failure to appear. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX3 241 - Boston, MA
May 10, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Desmond P. FitzGerald, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 This matter was last before us on February 24, 2012, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for the limited purpose of providing the respondent with the required voluntary departure advisals pursuant to Matter of Gamero, 25 I&N Dec. 164 (BIA 2010). On May 16, 2012, the Immigration Judge provided the respondent with the required advisals and granted her until May 23, 2012, to depart the United States voluntarily. On June 15, 2012, the respondent filed a timely appeal. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge denied her due process at her May 16, 2012, hearing. She indicates that her primary attorney was unavailable to represent her on May 16, 2012, because he was obligated to appear in a criminal case. Consequently, her primary attorney arranged for a substitute attorney to represent the respondent. The respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge denied her the right to counsel by requiring her to proceed without her primary attorney and by not continuing her case. She requests that the Board remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge to provide her with a new hearing in which she is represented by her primary attorney.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request for a continuance of her removal proceedings to await the availability of her primary counsel. See section 240(b)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(A); Matter of C-B-, 25 I&N Dec. 888 (BIA 2012). The respondent has not demonstrated that she was denied a full and fair hearing by the Immigration Judge’s denial of her request for a continuance. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987) (the decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown, and that decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing). The respondent’s removal proceedings were remanded by the Board solely to provide the respondent with the required voluntary departure advisals and to reinstate her voluntary departure period. The record reflects that the respondent was represented by a substitute counsel at her May 16, 2012, hearing. Hence, we find that the respondent was not denied her right to representation. Moreover, the respondent does not allege that her substitute counsel provided her with ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Thus, the respondent has not established that she was prejudiced by having a substitute counsel represent her at the hearing. See Pulisir v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 302 (1st Cir. 2008) (prejudice occurs when it is shown that an abridgement of due process is likely to have affected the outcome of the proceedings); Matter of C-B-, 25 I&N Dec. 888 (BIA 2012). In light of the foregoing, we agree with the Immigration Judge that “good cause” did not exist for a further continuance of these removal proceedings.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

File: AXXX XX3 933 - San Diego, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William Baker, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening, reissuance
 
*1 This case was last before us on September 15, 2005, when we affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to rescind the in absentia order entered against him. On March 4, 2013, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and reissue asking us to reissue our prior ruling in his case so that he may file a timely petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The respondent’s motion to reopen and reissue will be denied.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. In his current motion, he states that he failed to appear for his hearing before an Immigration Judge on January 6, 2005, because he had been removed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). He further claims that he and his wife did not file a petition for review with the Ninth Circuit after we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to rescind the in absentia order entered against him because his attorney did not inform him that he could do so. He asks that we reissue our prior decision in light of these circumstances so that he can file a petition for review. In the alternative, he asks that we reopen his proceedings sua sponte.
 
The respondent has not presented sufficient evidence to establish that reissuance or reopening is warranted in his case. The respondent’s motion to reopen and reissue is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (stating that motions to reopen “shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal”). Equitable tolling of the filing deadline for a motion to reopen is available when an alien is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent, however, has not provided sufficient information to establish that he acted with due diligence during the 7 ½ years between the issuance of our prior order and the filing of his current motion.1 See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 680 (9th Cir. 2011).
 
In addition, the respondent has provided conflicting information regarding whether he was, in fact, the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In his motion, the respondent states that his prior attorney was not necessarily ineffective because he and his wife understood that the case was over after this Board dismissed his appeal. The respondent further states that he has not filed a complaint against his former attorney because he does not think there has been an ethical violation. In the statements attached to the respondent’s motion, however, the respondent and his wife indicate that they would have filed a petition for review if their former attorney had told them about this option. With these apparent conflicts and the absence of a formal bar complaint, it is not clear that the respondent has presented sufficient evidence to meet the procedural requirements necessary to establish that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); cf. Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1045 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding that prejudice is presumed when former attorney filed untimely petition for review which prevented alien from pursuing petition).2
 
*2 Finally, the respondent has not provided sufficient information to establish that exceptional circumstances justify sua sponte reopening of his proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that our discretion to reopen sua sponte is limited to cases where exceptional circumstances are demonstrated). More than 7 years have passed since we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to rescind and the respondent has not provided much detail regarding what he has done to pursue his case during that time. In addition, there is a significant discrepancy between the statement the respondent submitted with his motion to rescind the in absentia order and the statement he has submitted with his current motion. In his current statement, the respondent indicates that he did not appear for his hearing because he had been removed. In his original statement, however, the respondent stated that he did not appear for his hearing because he thought the Immigration Judge had told him not to appear if he did not have an attorney. The respondent has not acknowledged this discrepancy or offered an explanation for it. He also has not provided any information to support his assertion that he was improperly removed before his hearing on January 6, 2005. Accordingly, based on the totality of the circumstances, the respondent has not provided sufficient evidence to establish that sua sponte reopening and reissuance of our prior ruling in his case is warranted. We therefore deny the respondent’s motion.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen and reissue is denied.

The respondent’s wife states that, over the years, she consulted with two different attorneys who told her nothing could be done in the respondent’s case. The respondent’s wife, however, does not indicate when she consulted these attorneys. The respondent’s wife also does not indicate when she consulted her current attorney or what prompted her to do so. The respondent therefore has not presented sufficient information to establish that he acted diligently in discovering what he alleges is the error of his prior attorney or in pursuing relief from this error.

The issues of due diligence and compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, were not discussed in Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, and the alien sought a remedy less than 3 years after the ineffective assistance occurred.

IN RE: HAI VAN HO AKA VAN HO
File: AXXX XX3 063 - Arlington, VA
April 30, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Arthur V. Cook, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 16, 2012, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen the removal proceedings. The Immigration Judge previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States to Vietnam, following the respondent’s failure to appear on time for a hearing on May 16, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to this appeal. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.1
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent contends that his failure to appear on time for the hearing on May 16, 2012, was due to an error made by his former counsel. In the respondent’s motion to reopen, filed with the Immigration Court, the respondent’s former counsel admits he made a mistake which resulted in him not appearing in court with the respondent, which was the reason the respondent was late in entering the courtroom for his hearing. Based on this assertion, it appears that the respondent is claiming that he did not appear on time at his scheduled hearing due to ineffective assistance of counsel. In Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996), we held that an alien alleging ineffective assistance of counsel who satisfied the requirements set out by this Board in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), had established exceptional circumstances for purposes of section 242B(c)(3) of the Act.
 
In the case at bar, the respondent has not complied with all of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. The motion is not supported by an affidavit or declaration by the respondent regarding the arrangement that was entered into with his former attorney, nor is there any evidence that the respondent filed a disciplinary complaint against his former attorney. However, because the respondent’s former attorney of record represented the respondent during the filing of the motion to reopen, the attorney had notice of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim and admitted that his mistake resulted in the respondent’s late arrival in the courtroom for his hearing.
 
The record in the instant case strongly indicates that there may have been ineffective assistance of counsel. Despite the respondent’s failure to meet the formal requirements of Matter of Lozada, we find that the respondent has presented a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
*2 The respondent did not have a motive for avoiding his hearing. In fact, the evidence indicates that he was at the hearing but entered the courtroom late because he was waiting for his attorney to join him. Likewise, his efforts in seeking reopening of these proceedings without undue delay further demonstrate his intention to appear for his hearing. Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

On appeal, the respondent argues that he did not receive notice of adjudication of his Form I-751, and that it still has not been ruled on so that the Immigration Court lacked jurisdiction in the case to order the respondent removed. However, evidence of record indicates that the Form I-751 was denied on February 18, 2010. As the case is being reopened and remanded, the respondent will have the opportunity to raise that issue before the Immigration Court.

IN RE: MARIA GABRIELA RAMIREZ-LOPEZ
File: AXXX XX3 236 - San Antonio, TX
April 30, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Philip A. Barr
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of December 10, 2012. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia on September 11, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a motion for summary affirmance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts.
 
Upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent received proper notice of the date, time, and location of her scheduled hearing before the Immigration Judge.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly found that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent (I.J. at 2; Exh. 2). See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 3.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a). The respondent admitted in her motion that she was given verbal notice of her September 11, 2012, hearing, but because her former counsel, Ms. Caballero, kept the written hearing notice, the respondent alleges she forgot the hearing date. On appeal, the respondent alleges that Ms. Caballero never notified the respondent of her hearing date, and failed to return her phone calls.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “““exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996). Here, however, the respondent has failed to comply with the Lozada requirements. See Lara v. Trominiski, 216 F.3d 487; 498 (5th Cir. 2000) (the general application of the Lozada requirements does not constitute an abuse of discretion). Consequently, the respondent has failed to perfect a claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel, and there is no basis to reopen under “exceptional circumstances”.
 
*2 We find that the respondent has not established an exceptional circumstance herein to warrant the sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Elizabeth Treacy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(R) of the Act
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
 
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings; continuance; motion to remand
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s January 4, 2013, decision finding him removable as charged and ordering him removed from the United States. During the pendency of his appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand. The motion will be denied, and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines, was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on June 26, 2001 (Exh. 1; I.J. at 2). On September 21, 2010, the respondent was convicted for the offenses of possession of methamphetamine, less than 5 grams; and, burglary, in violation of 720 ILCS sections 646/16(a) and 5/19-1(a), respectively, and for the offense of forgery digital signature in violation of 720 ILCS section 5/17-2(a)(4)(2) (I.J. at 3; Exh. 2). For each of these offenses, the respondent was sentenced to 3 years in prison (I.J. at 3; Exh. 2).
 
The respondent does not dispute the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that he is removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal as a result of his convictions (I.J. at 3). The respondent did not file any applications for relief (I.J. at 4). Rather, through his appeal, the respondent argues that he has been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel in these proceedings because his former attorney did not make the argument that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel during his criminal proceedings.
 
In this regard, we first note that the respondent has not complied with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim pursuant to our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), such that he can succeed. Briefly, the Lozada requirements are (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit detailing counsel’s failings, (2) that counsel be informed of the allegations, and (3) that the motion show that disciplinary charges have been filed with the appropriate authority. Id. Second, the alien “must also show that he or she was prejudiced by the actions or inactions of counsel.” See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003). Further, the record reflects that respondent’s counsel did in fact argue the respondent was a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel during his criminal proceedings (I.J. at 4-5). However, as found by the Immigration Judge, the respondent did not provide evidence establishing he had filed for or was granted any post-conviction relief by the criminal court. Thus, he did not establish that his convictions were not final for immigration purposes (I.J. at 4-5). See Matter of Chavez, 24 I&N Dec. 272 (BIA 2007).
 
*2 Through his motion to remand, the respondent argues that his case should be remanded to the Immigration Judge in accordance with Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), because he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel during his criminal proceedings relating to advisals regarding the immigration consequences of his conviction and that he has filed for post-conviction relief collaterally attacking his convictions. The respondent has submitted a copy of a motion he says was filed with the criminal court regarding his collateral attack in support of his request for a remand.1 Notwithstanding the respondent’s assertions, he has not submitted any evidence that the criminal court changed the disposition of his conviction. Without evidence that his conviction has been vacated or otherwise altered by the criminal court, his convictions remain final for immigration purposes. See Matter of Chavez, supra. Therefore, we find no reason to remand the respondent’s proceedings. The respondent does not otherwise dispute the Immigration Judge’s decision in this case.2
 
Accordingly, the motion will be denied, and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied, and the appeal is dismissed.

The respondent also submitted a copy of a letter from his criminal attorney which he alleges establishes ineffective assistance of counsel based on the attorney’s admissions. While, in this letter, the criminal attorney advises the respondent that he will have to seek post-conviction relief arguing ineffective assistance of counsel, the attorney maintains that he did his best during the criminal proceedings. In any event, the letter does not establish that the respondent’s convictions have been vacated by the criminal court.

2

In its reply brief, the government argues that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion for a continuance. In her written decision, the Immigration Judge does not reference a motion for a continuance. Likewise, the respondent does not raise this issue on appeal.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Xavier Rosas, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, was ordered removed in absentia on February 22, 2001. On December 16, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings, which the Immigration Judge denied on March 2, 2012. The respondent filed a timely appeal of that decision. The appeal will be sustained, proceedings will be reopened and the record will be remanded.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen finding that her motion was untimely and did not warrant sua sponte reopening. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied.
 
In light of the unique circumstances presented in this case, including evidence reflecting that the respondent’s former counsel provided ineffective assistance which resulted in the in absentia removal order because of his direction to the respondent not to appear at her February 22, 2001, hearing, an exceptional situation is present to warrant sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. In reaching this conclusion, we note that the respondent’s ability to demonstrate due diligence has been extremely hindered by the ongoing extensive and serious health issues of her lawful permanent resident husband, and we also note that that the respondent appears eligible for cancellation of removal.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tina N. Malek, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Scott Simpson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board’s order dated October 8, 2008, remanded this matter to the Immigration Judge for further fact-finding. The Immigration Judge’s August 27, 2009, decision on remand denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status and ordered him removed to Mexico. The Board entered the final administrative order on November 5, 2010, when we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal for failure to file a statement of reasons for the appeal and unexplained failure to file a brief.1 The respondent filed this motion to reopen his removal proceedings on January 15, 2013. The motion is filed nearly 2 years after the filing deadline. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (90-day time limit for filing motion to reopen). The Department of Homeland Security has filed a memorandum opposing the motion, which will be denied.
 
In bringing this untimely motion to reopen, the respondent claims ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board held in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), that due process rights may be violated when ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from reasonably presenting his case, and the time for filing a motion to reopen may be tolled in cases of ineffectiveness of counsel. The alien must, however, show that he was prejudiced by counsel’s performance. In Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003), the Ninth Circuit held that an alien failed to show prejudice when he could not “show that his admissibility arguments might have been successful on appeal to the BIA.” Since prejudice had not been shown, the court rejected an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in that case and upheld the Board’s summary dismissal of the appeal even though counsel failed to file a brief or statement of reasons for the appeal.2
 
Thus, in Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, supra, and Matter of Lozada, supra, counsels’ failure to file statements of reasons or briefs on appeal, although resulting in summary dismissal of the appeals, did not amount to deprivation of due process and was not prejudicial. In each case, the alien received a full and fair hearing at which the Immigration Judge properly considered and evaluated the alien’s evidence and correctly determined the legal issues. The same reasoning applies in the present matter. This respondent, prior to being admitted as a lawful permanent resident, was convicted under the California Penal Code of assault with a deadly weapon; subsequently, he was convicted of using or being under the influence of a controlled substance. The Immigration Judge properly determined that he never lawfully acquired permanent resident status, and was ineligible for waivers under sections 212(c), 212(h) and 212(i) of the Act. See I.J. at 5-6; see also Tr., Oct. 13, 2005, at 3-5. The respondent’s motion, which does not include a proposed appellate brief or offer the arguments that would be contained in a brief, does not persuade the Board that the Immigration Judge’s decision was incorrect or could have been overturned on appeal if counsel had filed a brief, or that the respondent could establish eligibility for any relief in a reopened hearing.
 
*2 The motion to reopen, therefore, does not establish prejudice from counsel’s performance. The respondent’s untimely motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and motion for a stay are denied.

The Rojas-Garcia decision distinguished Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir. 2000), in which the court recognized an ineffective assistance of counsel claim where the alien’s attorney failed to file a timely notice of appeal, resulting in summary dismissal of the appeal. Dearinger found a rebuttable presumption of prejudice, acknowledging that the alien was required to demonstrate a “plausible ground for relief to justify reopening for ineffective assistance of counsel. Id. at 1046. The alien met that standard.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen his removal proceedings on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen must establish the existence of new, previously unavailable, material evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The party requesting reopening bears the burden of establishing that reopening is warranted and that the new evidence would likely affect the outcome of the proceedings. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N 464 (BIA 1992). In the context of a claim of ineffective assistance, the alien must establish that prior counsel’s representation was defective and that the deficiencies affected the outcome of the removal proceedings. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The respondent’s assertions do not demonstrate that reopening is warranted. The attorney who allegedly committed ineffective assistance of counsel did not represent the respondent during the course of his removal proceedings or during a subsequent appeal to the Board.1 Rather, the respondent alleges the attorney committed ineffective assistance during the course of a filing of an I-130 family-based visa petition, an interview associated with the I-130 petition, and the filing of an application for advance parole. These alleged deficiencies took place in the context of separate proceedings which occurred prior to the initiation of removal proceedings against the respondent and which involve matters over which the Immigration Judge and this Board lack jurisdiction.2 The respondent has not demonstrated that his removal proceedings were affected by ineffective assistance of counsel in any respect. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent does allege that the attorney should have represented him during the appeal and that the respondent was left to represent himself pro se. However, the respondent has not provided evidence that the attorney agreed to represent the respondent during the course of the appeal. We note that the respondent was represented during the initial removal hearings, and the respondent has not accused the attorney who represented him below of ineffective assistance.

As the respondent is an arriving alien, the Immigration Judge would also have lacked jurisdiction over any adjustment of status application, even had the I-130 visa petition been approved. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(1)(ii).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on January 4, 2013, when we found that the respondent had waived his right to appeal through counsel. The respondent had not established that his waiver was not knowing and intelligent or that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and we declined to accept the appeal by certification. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider, and now asserts that his waiver was not knowing and intelligent because his counsel had not adequately advised him of his rights, including his right to appeal. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent raises an ineffective assistance of counsel argument, but has not shown compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), and this is not a case was inadequate representation is apparent from the record. See also Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005). The Immigration Judge specifically confirmed with the respondent at the outset of the final hearing that the “gentleman seated next to [him]” was his attorney and authorized to speak on his behalf. The respondent’s best language was English. Thereafter, in the respondent’s presence, his counsel indicated that it had been determined that the respondent could not proceed with an application for adjustment of status and that “we will agree to removal in this case.”1 Respondent’s counsel stated that he did not think there were any “available applications for relief” and agreed that the detained respondent wanted to take an order of removal. The Immigration Judge asked whether “this is a final order” and respondent’s counsel answered “yes.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (regarding action by an attorney of record).
 
While the respondent now states that his attorney did not explain the outcome of the Immigration Judge’s decision to him and that it came as a “surprise” that his appeal rights had been waived, his present claims in this regard are not supported by affidavit or otherwise. And, of equal significance, the respondent has not provided his prior counsel with any notice of these claims and an opportunity to respond. See id. Further, there is nothing presented with this motion that would cause us to reconsider the prior conclusion that further review of the Immigration Judge’s decision by certification has not been shown to be warranted.2 Under these circumstances, we are not persuaded that reconsideration of our January 14, 2013, decision is warranted. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay is denied as moot.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marcelo Gondim, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on February 27, 2009, when the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s March 11, 2008, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the January 28, 2008, removal order entered in absentia. On October 9, 2012, the respondent filed the pending motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent does not dispute the fact that his motion is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Rather, alleging ineffective assistance of former counsel(s), he requests that the applicable time limits be equitably tolled. However, the respondent has not sufficiently shown patent error nor substantially complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, including the requirement that he show prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra; Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). The respondent has submitted no evidence beyond what was previously before both the Immigration Judge and the Board to support his claim that exceptional circumstances, i.e., injuries from a traffic accident, prevented him from attending his scheduled hearing. The submitted insurance report does not reflect the respondent’s alleged injuries. Likewise, he has submitted no evidence to support his alleged claim that he ultimately did appear as scheduled, albeit late.
 
Moreover, on this record, we do not find that the respondent has sufficiently demonstrated due diligence in pursuing the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra; see, e.g., Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2007) (explaining that to warrant equitable tolling of a filing deadline, the petitioner must show that he has acted with due diligence). The doctrine of equitable tolling applies when “despite all due diligence, [the party invoking equitable tolling] is unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of the claim.” Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001) (internal quotations omitted). Despite his asserted inability to read and speak English, the respondent does not dispute that he was, at the very least, aware of both the Immigration Judge’s and the Board’s decisions in this case. Other than contacting current counsel, for which the respondent provides no dates or details, the respondent has offered no reasonable explanation for waiting more than 3 years from the Board’s final decision in this case to file the present motion.
 
*2 On this record, the respondent has not provided an adequate basis to excuse the untimeliness of his motion. Nor has he demonstrated an exceptional situation that would warrant reopening of these proceedings in the exercise of discretion under the Board’s sua sponte authority. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN RE: SIGIFREDO BUENO-GARCIA
File: AXXX XX4 502 - Seattle, WA
January 18, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathan Love
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 13, 2010, denying his request for a continuance of proceedings pending action on a collateral attack to his criminal conviction. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge sustained the charge of removability based on the respondent’s February 24, 2005, aggravated felony conviction for conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance in violation of Revised Code of Washington §§ 69.50.401(a)(1)(ii) and 69.50.407 (I.J. at 2; Exh. 2). The Immigration further determined that there was not good cause to continue the case pending action in state court on the respondent’s appeal from the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and vacate his criminal conviction (I.J. at 3-4). The respondent asserts on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying him a continuance of proceedings, argues that his immigration and criminal defense attorneys rendered ineffective assistance, and states that he was not guilty of the drug charge.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a motion for continuance “for good cause shown.” See 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.29, 240.6; Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). In determining whether an alien has demonstrated “good cause,” an Immigration Judge has broad discretionary authority. See Matter of Sibrun, supra, at 355-56. Indeed, we have held that “an Immigration Judge’s decision denying [a] motion for continuance will not be reversed unless the alien establishes that [the] denial caused him actual prejudice and harm and materially affected the outcome of his case.” Id. at 356-57. A conviction is final for immigration purposes despite the possibility of discretionary review or collateral attack. See Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894 (BIA 1994).
 
We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision denying a continuance of proceedings pending resolution in state court of the respondent’s appeal from the denial of his request to collaterally attack his criminal conviction. On the day of the merits hearing, a motion to withdraw the respondent’s guilty plea had been denied by the state court. We agree that a further continuance pending adjudication of a state court appeal was not warranted.
 
*2 As for the respondent’s claims of ineffective assistance, we find no basis to remand for further proceedings. As an initial matter, we note that the respondent has not complied with the evidentiary requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his immigration attorney outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).1 Moreover, he has not established that he was prejudiced by immigration counsel’s actions. Although more than 2 years have passed since the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent has not presented any evidence to establish that his state court appeal was successful and that his criminal conviction has been vacated. See Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999) (finding that prejudice must be shown for a due process challenge and that prejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected outcome); Mohsseni Behbahani v. INS, 796 F.2d 249, 251 (9th Cir. 1986) (finding that to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim there must be a showing of prejudice by counsel’s performance).
 
As for the respondent’s challenge to the actions of his criminal defense attorney and his claim of innocence to the criminal charge, these matters are within the jurisdiction of the state court, not the Immigration Judge or this Board. See Matter of Onyido, 22 I&N Dec. 552, 558 (BIA 1999) (it is impermissible for Immigration Judges or the Board to go behind a conviction and reassess an alien’s guilt or innocence). Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: JURATE VIRGYCIO MILUTYTE
File: AXXX XX1 053 - Cleveland, OH

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard Thompson Herman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Amy L. Sheurman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Lithuania, has filed a motion to reopen the proceedings and requesting that we reconsider our previous decision, dated August 23, 2012. In the decision, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from a September 9, 2011, Immigration Judge decision denying the respondent a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(i). The motion will be denied.
 
We review the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether or not the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
In her motion, the respondent argues that her previous attorney was ineffective in failing to fully develop the record. She argues he failed to have her clarify problems in her testimony concerning a false claim on a student loan application and to have her husband clearly state that he would not travel to Lithuania, but only while his elderly mother was still alive and needed care in the United States.1 She also argues the attorney erred in failing to submit the student loan documentation. We first observe that the respondent has failed to fully comply with the requirements set out in our decision Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857 (6th Cir. 2006); Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). The respondent states that she did not file a complaint against her former attorney as he is a good person. However, this does not excuse compliance with the requirements. Whether or not the previous attorney meant well does not alter the purposes of this requirement, including the deterrence of meritless claims and highlighting the standards expected of attorneys in immigration proceedings. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639-40.
 
Nonetheless, even had the respondent complied with the filing requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, the motion would be denied as she has failed to demonstrate any prejudice from the actions of the previous attorney. See Sako v. Gonzales, supra. The Immigration Judge and this Board rested our denial of relief, in part, on the respondent’s false statement that her daughter was a lawful permanent resident on an application for college financial aid (BIA at 2; I.J. at 13). The respondent has now submitted a printout from the financial aid office indicating that the daughter’s status was recorded as “eligible - non-citizen” and a response from the office stating there was not enough information to confirm the daughter’s noncitizen status (Resp. Mot., Exh. B). The respondent also argues that, at the time of her testimony, she did not clearly recall what information she had provided on the form.
 
*2 However, the printout submitted fails to support the respondent’s argument, as it does not indicate what status she claimed for her daughter. It has never been argued that she indicated her daughter was a citizen. We continue to accept her testimony at the time of the hearing that she indicated that her daughter was a lawful permanent resident (Tr. at 66 (daughter), 96, 130-35). The failure of the previous attorney to properly submit this document is not material to the respondent’s claim, as it does not contradict the respondent’s testimony. Furthermore, while the respondent now wishes to clarify her and her husband’s testimony or supplement the testimony in various ways, this does not indicate that the previous attorney erred in presenting the case.
 
The respondent also argues that the Board failed to apply the proper legal standard and that we failed to consider all of the evidence of record, in particular the letter submitted by a doctor concerning the husband’s psychological health. We disagree. While the respondent may wish that we gave more weight to the letter and its conclusions, it was considered previously (BIA at 2). The husband will face emotional hardship from the separation and does suffer from depression related to the removal process. Although the letter states that separation would result in “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” to the husband, we continue to find the hardship he will face does not rise to “extreme hardship” as provided for under immigration law. See Matter of Cervantes, 22 I&N Dec.560 (BIA 1999), aff’d 232 F.3d 684 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
The Board and the Immigration Judge also properly considered the husband’s testimony, at the time of the hearing that the husband would remain in the United States, due to the health of his mother (Tr. at 85-86). It follows that he may choose to travel to Lithuania once he no longer needs to care for her, but this is speculative. In any event, despite his depression and lack of language skills, his relocation to his wife’s country is not a hardship that is out of the ordinary for a couple where one member is facing removal. In closing, we also note the respondent’s arguments concerning family unity and the remand of her daughter’s record for possible relief. Nonetheless, this remand was part of our previous decision and was properly considered at that time. Based on the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

The respondent has also submitted a letter from the former attorney to the Department of Homeland Security stating that he lacks experience in Immigration Court.

File: AXXX XX8 172 - Dallas, TX
December 13, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lorena N. Gutierrez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on July 28, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On July 30, 2012, more than 1 year after the Board’s order, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). In the motion, the respondent argues that his proceedings should be reopened based on the ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney Keith Willeford, who represented him before the Immigration Judge and the Board (the “former counsel”). The respondent argues that the former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to file before the Immigration Judge a proper application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1), in a timely manner, and by failing to request an extension. The respondent argues that he complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), by submitting an affidavit and notifying the former counsel of his ineffective assistance of counsel claims, as well as filing a complaint with the State Bar of Texas (Motion Exhs. B, C, D). The respondent also submitted an application for cancellation of removal and supporting documents, consisting of his birth certificate and identification card, his son’s birth certificate, his father’s certificate of naturalization, and the approval notice of an I-130 visa petition filed by his father (Motion Exhs. G, K).
 
However, the respondent’s motion is untimely as noted above, and the respondent has presented no arguments, and has submitted no evidence, showing how he acted with due diligence during the 1-year period since the Board dismissed his appeal. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has not addressed in a published decision whether the motion time limitations may be equitably tolled in cases claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 219-220 (5th Cir. 2008) (holding that a request for equitable tolling of a time or number-barred motion to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is “in essence an argument that the BIA should have sua sponte reopened the proceeding based upon the doctrine of equitable tolling”). An alien seeking equitable tolling of a motion to reopen period based on ineffective assistance of counsel must affirmatively demonstrate how he acted with due diligence during the entire period he seeks to toll, and the respondent has not done so. See, e.g., Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127 (2d Cir. 2008); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006).
 
*2 The respondent urges us to sua sponte reopen his proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Based on the circumstances presented in this case, we do not find that the respondent’s case presents “exceptional circumstances” that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied.1

We also note that the respondent has submitted documents showing that his father and son are United States citizens and that he is the beneficiary of an I-130 visa petition filed by his father, but he has not submitted sufficient evidence showing that his qualifying relatives will suffer hardship rising to the level of “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” upon his removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (providing that a motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and “all supporting documentation”).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Aarti R. Sampat, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 On September 27, 2012, this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The record showed that the respondent, through counsel, waived appeal. Our decision observed that the respondent did not, in filing his appeal, argue that the waiver was not a knowing and intelligent one. Thus, the Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider, which will be denied.
 
In his motion, the respondent observes that the Immigration Judge’s order did not reflect that the appeal was waived in his case (Mot. at 1-2). The respondent also states that he did not recall waiving appeal in the immigration court and he asserts that the immigration court’s information system confirmed that the appeal in the case was due by July 11, 2012 (Mot. at 1-2). The respondent argues that appeal was not waived in his case (Mot. at 3-4). In the alternative, he argues that any waiver was not knowingly or intelligently made since his attorney did not explain his appeal rights to him (Mot. at 3-4).
 
The transcript in this matter establishes that the respondent was granted voluntary departure, the only form of relief for which he applied (Tr. at 45-49).1 The respondent does not currently dispute that the attorney who represented him at his hearing stated on the record that appeal would be waived. (Tr. at 49). Although the respondent now asserts that his attorney did not explain his appeal rights to him, the respondent has not filed a motion alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Accordingly, he has not established a basis for reconsideration or reopening. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (providing that an alien is generally bound by the conduct of his attorney).
 
We separately note that even if the respondent had not waived his right to appeal, an appeal from a decision that granted the only relief that was requested is subject to a summary dismissal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(C).
 
The respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

*1 The Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 28, 1991, denied the respondent’s application for suspension of deportation and ordered him deported to Nigeria. The respondent, through counsel, filed a timely Notice of Appeal with the Board. Counsel subsequently failed to file a brief or otherwise present any specific factual or legal basis for the appeal, and the Board summarily dismissed the appeal in our decision entered on January 16, 1992. The respondent filed a motion to reopen these proceedings on August 23, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The motion, filed more than 20 years after the Board’s order in the matter, is barred by the applicable time limit. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (motion to reopen deportation proceedings must be filed no later than 90 days after the final deportation order). The motion does not cite any exception to the filing deadline, but claims that the respondent’s former counsel was ineffective in his handling of the appeal decided by the Board in 1992 (incorrectly asserting, however, that counsel did not file a Notice of Appeal). We note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has held that the 90-day time limit for motions to reopen is “mandatory and jurisdictional” and not subject to equitable tolling, even where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised. See Abdi v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 430 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir. 2005). We further note that the motion does not show that the respondent has complied with the requirements prescribed by the Board in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988), nor does it show that the respondent has been diligent in pursuing his rights over the time period of more than 20 years since the Board’s decision in his appeal.
 
The motion is not accompanied by affidavits or evidence in any form. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (motion to reopen must be supported by affidavits or other material evidence stating the new facts that would be proven at a reopened hearing). Without an evidentiary submission, the motion does not demonstrate either that counsel’s representation was ineffective or that the respondent is eligible for any relief. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 561-62 (BIA 2003) (holding that alien asserting ineffective assistance of counsel must document that he is eligible for the relief sought). Further, while the respondent claims to be eligible for relief, the motion does not include an application for relief as required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).
 
*2 For the above reasons, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and motion for a stay are denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion for change of venue is denied as moot.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Herbert A. Igbanugo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Thomas S. Madison
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on July 16, 2012, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his petition to remove the conditional nature of his residence in the United States under section 216(c)(3)(D) of the Act. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings on October 15, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen shall not be granted unless it appears that the evidence sought to be offered “was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Further, this Board has held that a party who seeks to reopen proceedings to pursue a discretionary grant of relief from removal bears a “heavy burden” of demonstrating that if his motion to reopen were granted, the new evidence presented would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
With his motion, the respondent has submitted over 30 affidavits from friends and acquaintances as support for his claim that he and his wife entered into a marriage in good faith. We find these statements and affidavits insufficient to bear the respondent’s heavy burden to show that such evidence would likely change the result in his case. Id. The various statements are from witnesses not subject to cross-examination; moreover, as the DHS argues in its opposition, such evidence was previously available during the respondent’s hearing. While the respondent states that his attorney should have told him to obtain such statements, he has not prepared an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in accordance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), nor has he otherwise demonstrated how his attorney’s advice, or lack thereof, excepts him from this regulatory requirement. See Fongwo v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 944 (8th Cir. 2005)(attorney’s alleged advice to forego presentation of documents does not mean they were unavailable).1
 
Lastly, we do not find that the respondent’s evidence presents an exceptional circumstance which would warrant reopening in our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997)(stating that “[t]he power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). As we noted in our previous decision, even without the respondent’s adverse credibility finding, the DHS proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent did not enter the marriage in good faith (Bd. Dec. at 2; I.J. at 6). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Reynold E. Finnegan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a 26-year-old male native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s July 30, 2012, written order which denied his motion to rescind his in absentia removal order. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues involving questions of law, judgement and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On October 5, 2005, the respondent was placed in removal proceedings with the issuance of a Notice to Appear, which he signed. He failed to appear at a hearing on November 7, 2007, and was ordered removed in absentia. The respondent filed a motion to rescind his in absentia order, claiming that he had not received notice of his hearing, and an Immigration Judge granted the motion on February 16, 2011.
 
On June 8, 2011, the respondent personally appeared, along with prior counsel, and was informed that his next hearing was on March 23, 2012. Following a hearing conducted in absentia on March 23, 2012, when he failed to appear, an Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal as charged, and ordered him removed from the United States. See generally section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a.
 
An order of removal issued after in absentia proceedings may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
On July 17, 2012, the respondent, through present counsel, filed a motion to rescind his March 23, 2012, in absentia order, claiming that he had not received notice of the March 23, 2012, hearing from his prior attorney because he was in a “disagreement” with her and she allegedly did not notify him about the March 23, 2012, hearing.1 He also requested reopening because his prior attorney allegedly committed ineffective assistance of counsel without elaboration. Finally, he claimed that he had not received the Notice to Appear.
 
*2 On July 30, 2012, an Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen because the respondent appeared in person at the June 8, 2011, hearing and received personal and written notification of the March 23, 2012, hearing, as well as the consequences for failure to appear.
 
We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent’s prior counsel was properly notified about the March 23, 2012, hearing, which constitutes notice to him. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (notice to alien’s counsel constitutes notice to alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). He also personally appeared at the hearing on June 8, 2011, and was notified about the hearing scheduled for March 23, 2012. Contrary to his contentions on appeal, the respondent received personal service of the Notice to Appear, and he was fully informed about the consequences for failing to appear because the Notice to Appear, which he signed on October 5, 2005, indicated that he received oral notice in Spanish about the consequences.
 
Insofar as the respondent alleged in his motion that his prior attorney had committed ineffective assistance of counsel, he failed to specify what conduct constituted the basis of his ineffective assistance claim, he did not comply with the standards to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel because he had not filed a formal bar complaint against his prior counsel, and he has not specifically raised ineffective assistance as an issue on appeal.2 Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Finally, the respondent alleged in a July 16, 2012, affidavit attached to his motion that he “was engaged in a criminal matter at the same time” without elaboration and that he “possibly” may have been in custody on March 23, 2012, but “I am unable to recall the dates of my incarceration.” In addition, the brief submitted on appeal claimed for the first time that the respondent was requesting reopening on the basis of unspecified “exceptional circumstances,” an apparent reference to his possible incarceration on March 23, 2012. However, it is inappropriate to raise exceptional circumstances as a basis for reopening for the first time on appeal because the Immigration Judge has not had an opportunity to address it, and we will not consider it now. Moreover, these allegations are insufficient without more to establish that the respondent was unable to appear because he was in custody on March 23, 2012, and he has not provided any documentation on appeal to establish whether he was incarcerated on March 23, 2012. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

On March 1, 2012, the respondent’s prior attorney filed a motion to withdraw, which was denied on March 6, 2012. She indicated that the respondent had failed to respond to both telephone calls and letters, and had failed to arrive for scheduled appointments.

His contentions for the first time on appeal about how his prior attorney allegedly did not notify him about the hearing because she mailed him letters in 2012 which he did not receive due to an incorrect zip code are irrelevant because he already had been personally notified on June 8, 2011 about his March 23, 2012, hearing, and he failed to maintain contact with his attorney.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nash Fayad, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The final administrative order of removal in these proceedings was entered by the Board on November 13, 2008. On May 30, 2012, the respondent, a native and citizen of Ethiopia, filed the pending motion. The respondent does not dispute the fact that his motion is untimely. Rather, he contends that the applicable time limits should be equitably tolled because of the deficient performance of former counsel(s). The respondent asserts, in part, that former counsel(s) never informed him that his appeal had been dismissed. However, the respondent, who does not dispute that he was aware that an appeal was pending before the Board, has not described or identified what efforts he undertook during the period between the time his appeal was filed and his alleged 2009 discovery that it had been dismissed. Likewise, he has not described or identified what efforts he undertook between his alleged 2009 discovery and the filing of the instant motion 3 years later, other than to hire current counsel, for which he also provides no dates or details.
 
Nor has the respondent sufficiently complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, including the requirement that he show prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
Under the circumstances, we do not find equitable tolling of the 90-day-deadline warranted. See also Harris v. Hutchinson, 209 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir. 2000) (recognizing that equitable tolling may be appropriate where the litigant was either prevented from asserting his or her claim by some kind of wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant, or extraordinary circumstances beyond the litigant’s control made it impossible to comply with the statutory time limit).
 
On this record, the respondent has not provided an adequate basis to excuse the untimeliness of his motion. Nor has he demonstrated an exceptional situation that would warrant reopening in the exercise of discretion under the Board’s sua sponte authority. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph Zurita, Esquire
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals the Immigration Judge’s August 6, 2012, decision denying her motion to reopen. We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment arising in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo, whereas we review findings of fact in such appeals under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent’s motion alleged that her prior attorney’s ineffective assistance led to the Immigration Judge’s September 16, 2011, decision ordering the respondent removed in absentia.
 
In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we stated that a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement between the applicant and her legal representative and what actions were to be taken on her behalf, (2) that the counsel whose reputation is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) an indication of whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not.
 
Under our de novo standard of review, we conclude that the respondent’s motion to reopen did not comply with Matter of Lozada. In fact, the motion conceded that no compliance had yet been attempted. It instead asserted that evidence of compliance would be submitted later. The respondent submitted no further evidence during the 2 week period between the motion’s filing and the issuance of the Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
Nor has the respondent demonstrated compliance on appeal that would warrant a remand. The respondent has submitted a statement describing the events surrounding the issuance of her in absentia order of removal, see Respondent’s Brief at Tab A, but this statement is deficient, for it is signed but unsworn. Unsworn allegations do not constitute evidence. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of S-M-, 22 I&N Dec. 49, 51 (BIA 1998). Even if this statement had been sworn, the respondent would not have demonstrated compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, for she has not submitted evidence as to whether prior counsel has been informed of the allegations and given an opportunity to respond and evidence whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities.
 
Although the respondent’s motion did not meet the standards for reopening under Matter of Lozada, supra, a motion can nonetheless be a basis for reopening to apply for a form of relief, such as asylum, if the motion contains evidence of circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the final hearing. See 8 C.F.R § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent’s motion, however, did not present evidence of changed circumstances or country conditions arising after the respondent’s final hearing.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX3 358 - Miami, FL
November 6, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
*1 A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b), (c). The Immigration Judge’s written decision was mailed to the respondent’s counsel in September 2007. The respondent did not file her Notice of Appeal with the Board until more than 5 years later on October 1, 2012. Thus, the appeal is untimely. The Immigration Judge’s August 29, 2007, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen accordingly remains final, and the record will be returned to the Immigration Court without further action.1 See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.
 
Because we are dismissing the appeal as untimely, either party wishing to file a motion should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court.2 See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See sections 240(c)(6)(A) and (B) and 240(c)(7)(A) and (C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6)(A) and (B) and (c)(7)(A) and (C); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
We separately note that the respondent’s allegations that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel are not meaningfully raised, where she has not complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), nor shown prejudice.
 
*2 In light of the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.

We note that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) - rather than the Immigration Judge - has jurisdiction over the respondent’s request to pursue adjustment of status, as the respondent is an arriving alien. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 107 (BIA 2009). The USCIS can adjudicate an application for adjustment of status without regard to these removal proceedings.

To the extent that the respondent is seeking deferred action, that is a matter of prosecutorial discretion outside the Board’s purview. Nevertheless, the respondent may be eligible to seek deferred action pursuant to the June 15, 2012, announcement from the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), which referenced certain young people who are low law enforcement priorities. Information regarding DHS’ Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals may be obtained on-line (www.uscis.gov or www.ice.gov) or by phone on the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services hotline at 1-800-375-5283 or the Immigration Customs and Enforcement hotline at 1-888-351-4024.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marina Alexandrovich, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alec J. Niziolek
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal on December 20, 2011. He submitted a motion to reopen September 14, 2012, also asking for a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the respondent’s motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely as it was filed more than 90 days after the Board’s decision. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). However, the respondent contends that former counsel provided him with ineffective assistance (Motion at 3). Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). He also asks that the Board sua sponte reopen proceedings (Motion at 9). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
The respondent has submitted a statement averring that he filed a state bar complaint against former counsel, Mr. Bracamonte, and mailed a copy of the same to him. However, as he has not submitted a copy of the complaint, it is unclear what errors he alleged Mr. Bracamonte committed. He has not clarified this omission in his motion. In his statement he appears to contend that Mr. Bracamonte erred by admitting the factual allegations, and conceding removability. However, even assuming that was the basis for his bar complaint, he has not identified any error regarding the factual allegations, nor stated a meritorious ground for contesting the charges of removability (Exhs. 1, 1a). Further, as this Board previously noted, the record contains various exhibits supporting the Immigration Judge’s findings regarding both the factual allegations and the removal charges (Exhs. 2, 9, 10, 13). In this regard, we observe that in the instant motion the respondent concedes, rather than contests, his alienage (Declaration). In sum, given this record, Mr. Bracamonte could have reasonably decided to admit the allegations and concede removability. See Knowles v. Mirzayance, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1422 (2009) ( “Counsel also is not required to have a tactical reason-above and beyond a reasonable appraisal of a claim’s dismal prospects for success-for recommending that a weak claim be dropped altogether.”); Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 934 (9th Cir. 1986) (attorney’s decision to forego contesting deportability was a tactical decision that did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance).
 
*2 In addition, the respondent has not shown that Mr. Bracamonte’s factual admissions and failure to challenge the grounds of removability “may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Iturribarria v. INS, supra at 899-900. Nor has he shown that there were “plausible grounds” for an alternative outcome. Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003). As such, he has not shown that he was prejudiced by Mr. Bracamonte’s actions. Furthermore, we do not find that this case presents exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of our discretionary authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Therefore, his motion is not exempt from the noted time-bar based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Given this record, neither reopening nor a stay of removal is warranted. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Polina Tomashevsky, Esquire
*1 This case was last before us on May 14, 2009, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s June 10, 2008, decision finding him removable as an aggravated felon. The respondent has now filed, on June 8, 2012, an untimely motion to reopen proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be granted pursuant to our sua sponte authority.
 
The procedural history of this case is as follows: The Immigration Judge initially granted the respondent’s motion to terminate proceedings on February 11, 2005, finding that the respondent was not removable under either section 237(a)(1)(C)(I) nor section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act. Subsequently, in a decision dated September 11, 2006, the Board reversed the Immigration Judge’s decision, and found that the respondent was removable pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act for having violated his nonimmigrant status. We further found that the respondent’s conviction for resisting arrest constituted a crime of violence under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, and therefore created his removability as an aggravated felon under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act. As such, we remanded the record for further proceedings regarding the respondent’s requests for relief from removal, or, in the alternative, for an entry of a final order of removal. The respondent appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,1 but also appeared before the Immigration Court again, and stated on remand, through his attorney, that “we’re reserving all relief. We don’t have any relief at this moment (Tr. at 64). Accordingly, the Immigration Judge issued a summary order of removal on June 10, 2008, indicating that the respondent had not applied for relief. The respondent appealed this decision on September 26, 2008, arguing that the Immigration Judge had erred in finding the respondent removable as an aggravated felon. On May 14, 2009, we found that because the respondent had appealed to the Fourth Circuit rather than filing a timely motion to reconsider our June 10, 2008, decision, we would decline to revisit our previous decision, and we dismissed the respondent’s appeal (2009 Bd. Dec. at 1). The respondent has now filed a motion, on June 8, 2012, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his prior proceedings because his prior counsel did not pursue an adjustment of status application in his behalf, even though he had originally requested such relief prior to the Board’s 2005 remand of his proceedings (Tr. at 2-3, 40).
 
*2 In support of these arguments, the respondent has filed evidence in substantial compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent has also filed evidence in support of his claim that he has maintained an approved visa petition through his brother, with a current priority date, since 2003 (Tr. At 3-4), but that at the remanded hearing in 2007, his attorney stated that no relief was available to the respondent (Tr. at 51, 64). The respondent has also submitted an adjustment of status application, as well as various documents in support of his application for relief.
 
We find that a remand is warranted in our sua sponte authority. It does appear that due to the complicated procedural history of the respondent’s case, his opportunity to demonstrate eligibility for adjustment of status was overlooked at his various hearings. Inasmuch as the respondent does not appear prima facie ineligible for such relief, and given the particular circumstances in the respondent’s case, including the DHS’ lack of opposition, we will reopen the respondent’s proceedings under our sua sponte authority and will provide him a further opportunity to seek relief from removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Upon remand, both parties may further address the respondent’s statutory and discretionary eligibility for adjustment and any commensurate waivers of inadmissibility. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mark Lee, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On February 29, 2012, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the June 25, 2010, decision in which the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had abandoned her application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), for failure to file the application in a timely manner. On June 5, 2012, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen in which she alleges ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of her former attorney. The Department of Homeland Security has not opposed the motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g). The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). She has also offered evidence in support of an application for adjustment of status that reveals her prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status as the parent of a United States citizen at the time of the removal hearing. Upon consideration of the evidence before us, it appears that the respondent suffered prejudice as a result of her former attorney’s handling of her case. Id. at 640.
 
Although the respondent’s motion is untimely by 6 days, in light of the particular circumstances present in this case, the Board will exercise its sua sponte authority and grant this unopposed motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly, the proceedings will be reopened and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s application for adjustment of status, and for other action as may be deemed appropriate.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kenneth Panzer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Vera Hochberg
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Jamaica. An in absentia order of removal was first entered against him on December 8, 2011. On December 21, 2011, the respondent filed a motion seeking to rescind the court’s order. The motion to reopen was denied, and a motion for reconsideration followed on January 3, 2012. On January 4, 2012, the Immigration Judge denied reconsideration. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The Immigration Judge considered the respondent’s statement that he wanted his day in court and did not understand the last decision. Given the respondent’s statements, the Immigration Judge denied reconsideration. We agree with the denial. We acknowledge that when the respondent filed his last motion, he submitted a hand-written statement on his own because his attorney was out of the country. Nonetheless, his motion failed to address the issues in the Immigration Judge’s decision with which he took issue. The federal regulations provide that a motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration, be supported by pertinent case precedent and be predicated on a legal or factual defect in the most recent decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2). See also Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). As the respondent’s statements did not meet this standard, the respondent did not establish a sufficient basis to justify reconsideration. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
We acknowledge that on appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge applied the wrong factors in evaluating the merits of his motion to reopen and he believes an in absentia order of removal was entered prematurely without affording him an opportunity to present any evidence (Br. at 2). These contentions relate to the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen-- arguments which more properly should have been advanced in the motion for reconsideration and not on appeal now. To the extent that the respondent also submits affidavits from family and friends and a letter written to his former attorney of record, Ms. Sharon Brown, to establish that he was not properly advised by Ms. Brown, these documents, again, should have been introduced earlier.1 We conclude that the respondent failed to establish a legal or factual basis for reconsideration by the Immigration Judge and specifically, as to the merits of the appeal, we agree with the government that this appeal is not an opportunity for the respondent to file new evidence or advance contentions that should have been made at a prior stage (DHS Br. at 3).
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In spite of the respondent’s attorney’s dissatisfaction wtih Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637,639 (BIA 1988), as a matter of law, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim will not lie, if the requirements in Lozada are not met.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Benjamin T. Wiesinger, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lorely R. Fernandez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The pending motion to reopen, which seeks to reopen and rescind the Immigration Judge’s November 3, 2005, decision ordering the respondent removed in absentia, is both untimely filed and number barred and has not been shown to satisfy any exception to the filing requirements imposed by law on motions to reopen removal proceedings. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7).
 
Moreover, we decline to equitably toll the applicable filing deadline based on the respondent’s alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel(s) claim. The respondent contends that former counsel(s) failed to properly pursue her alleged lack of notice of her hearing claim based on her assertion that the address listed on the Notice to Appear does not correctly reflect the address that she provided and, as a result, the notice of hearing was sent to the wrong address. However, the respondent’s claim is undermined by her husband’s affidavit wherein he indicates that the Notice to Appear reflects the address that was provided by the respondent (Submission of Respondent’s Additional Evidence dated December 15, 2011, at 4). Despite the respondent’s assertion that first former counsel forged her signature on the March 3, 2010, dated affidavit that was submitted along with her first motion to reopen that was filed before the Immigration Judge on April 15, 2010, she does not claim that subsequent counsel forged her husband’s signature. Under the circumstances, we do not find the respondent’s assertion alone sufficient to demonstrate that the notice of hearing was sent to the wrong address. The respondent therefore has not sufficiently shown patent error or prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Nor has she substantially complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against each of her former counsels. See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
Finally, the respondent, who does not dispute personal service of the Notice to Appear, has not provided a coherent and persuasive explanation for why she waited almost five years to file a motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge. Nor has she demonstrated an exceptional situation that would warrant reopening in the exercise of discretion under the Board’s sua sponte authority.
 
*2 On this record, the respondent has not provided an adequate basis to excuse the fact that her motion is both untimely filed and number barred. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Leslie Snyder, Esquire
 
CHARGES:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)] - Convicted of crime involving moral turpitude
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of South Africa who adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident on March 16, 1999. On December 3, 2002, the respondent was placed in removal proceedings by the issuance of a Notice to Appear based on his convictions for burglary of an occupied dwelling and grand theft in the third degree under Fla. Stat. §§ 810.02(3)(a) and 812.014(2)(c), respectively. On February 11, 2005, an Immigration Judge entered an order of removal in absentia.
 
On April 19, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. In the motion, the respondent argued that based on Matter of Alyazji, 25 I&N Dec. 397 (BIA 2011), he was not removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) for a crime involving moral turpitude because he committed the theft and burglary offenses more than 5 years after his 1990 admission. He also argued that he should be permitted to re-enter the United States as a lawful permanent resident because the Notice to Appear was improvidently issued. The Department of Homeland Security opposed the motion to reopen as untimely.
 
On May 17, 2011, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. Relying on 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) and Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008), the Immigration Judge concluded that she did not have jurisdiction to reopen the respondent’s in absentia order of removal because the respondent departed the United States. The respondent now appeals. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7) (2012). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings regarding witness credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i)(2012). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
*2 After the Immigration Judge issued her order denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, under whose jurisdiction this case arises, decided Jian Le Lin v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 681 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir. 2012), in which the court disagreed with our holding in Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, supra. The court held that the regulatory departure bar, which prohibits the filing of a motion to reopen by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States, conflicts with the statutory right of an alien to file one motion to reopen. Jian Le Lin v. U.S. Atty. Gen., supra, at 1239-41. See also section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(d), 1003.23(b). Thus, under the controlling authority of the Eleventh Circuit, the Immigration Judge had jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s motion to reopen, notwithstanding the respondent’s departure from the United States. Jian Le Lin v. U.S. Atty. Gen., supra. See Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25 (BIA 1989) (holding that the Board generally must follow circuit court precedent in cases arising in the circuit).
 
Nonetheless, we will affirm the denial of the motion to reopen on alternative grounds. A motion to reopen an in absentia order of removal must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). A motion to reopen in an absentia removal order pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Act may be filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive notice of the hearing. Id.
 
The Immigration Judge entered the respondent’s in absentia removal order on February 11, 2005; the respondent filed his motion to reopen on April 19, 2011. The motion to reopen was untimely because the respondent filed it more than 180 days after the entry of the removal order. Further, the respondent does not allege, or establish, that his failure to appear was due to extraordinary circumstances as that term is defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). He also does not claim that he did not have notice of the February 11, 2005, hearing. Id. Indeed, the respondent’s motion to reopen indicates that his attorney appeared at the February 11, 2005, hearing although the respondent had already departed the United States (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2; Exh. 4). Based on the record before us, we conclude that the respondent’s motion to reopen his in absentia order of removal was untimely.
 
*3 The respondent states in his motion and on appeal that he relied on erroneous advice of counsel and departed the United States (Respondent’s Br. at 7; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2). To the extent that this statement may be construed as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we note that the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009).
 
For these reasons we affirm the denial of the motion to reopen, albeit for reasons different from the Immigration Judge. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: BARBARA ROBINSON
File: AXXX XX2 823 - Buffalo, NY
October 5, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent has filed an untimely, number-barred motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). She seeks equitable tolling due to ineffective assistance of one of her former counsel, Daniel Aidif, who did not file a motion to reopen prior to expiration of the time within which she had to voluntarily depart.
 
The respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Romero v. United States INS, 399 F.3d 109, 112 (2d Cir. 2005). However, the respondent has not demonstrated a basis for equitable tolling as she has not shown prejudice. Vartelas v. Holder, 620 F.3d 108, 115 (2d Cir. 2010). That is, an alien claiming that she received ineffective assistance of counsel must show that counsel’s “performance was so ineffective as to have impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing.” Debeatham v. Holder, 602 F.3d 481, 485 (2d Cir. 2010)(citations omitted); Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 130 (2d Cir. 2008).
 
The respondent has not made this showing. The Immigration Judge entered the final administrative order in this case on August 5, 2003. The respondent did not enter into a contract with Mr. Aidif until November 17, 2003, which was after expiration of the 90 day period within which to file a timely motion to reopen. Therefore, Mr. Aidif could not have filed a timely motion to reopen or otherwise complied with Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002).
 
Further, the respondent has the burden to demonstrate that she exercised due diligence during the “entire” time she seeks to have tolled, which “includes both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed.” Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008). See also Ali v. Gonzales, 448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir. 2007)(alien must demonstrate that he exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006)(“[N]o matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled.”).
 
*2 The respondent has not provided a sufficient explanation as to why she waited until 2012 to file the present motion regarding Mr. Aidif. The respondent has filed six previous motions, but she has not specifically alleged ineffective assistance as to Mr. Aidif, or otherwise satisfied the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, prior to this motion, even though the representation about which she complains occurred in 2003. Therefore, due diligence has not been demonstrated.1
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen shall be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

We note that, hand-written on a Form EOIR-27 submitted with the present motion, the respondent also states that her “most recent lawyer, Andrew Rappeport,” did not present the new evidence in connection with a motion filed in 2011. However, no further explanation of this claim has been made, nor is there any evidence of Lozada compliance in connection with any claim against this attorney.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gerardo S. Gutierrez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lynn K. Hollander
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 6, 2011. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent alleged in his motion to reopen that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the respondent did not comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel or submit sufficient documentation supporting his claim that he is eligible to pursue cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3) (requiring that a motion to reopen be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documents). Furthermore, we find no merit to the respondent’s arguments on appeal, where there is no evidence that a motion for a continuance was denied or that the respondent was ordered removed in absentia. In addition, the respondent has not presented any evidence demonstrating that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he is inadmissible to the United States. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(c) (placing the burden on the alien to establish that he is clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted to the United States). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James F. Kajtoch, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The final order of removal in this matter was entered on June 3, 2010, when this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent not eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). On August 6, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
With certain exceptions, an alien is entitled to file only one motion to reopen and the motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s motion is untimely.
 
The respondent asserts, however, that his motion is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and a claim that equitable tolling applies. A motion to reopen claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must substantially comply with the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. Prejudice results when the inadequate performance may have affected the outcome of the case. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785 (9th Cir. 2005).
 
The respondent has submitted evidence that after the Board’s decision was issued on June 3, 2010, he entered into an agreement with Michael J. Hernandez for the filing of a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Mot. at 1-3; Mot. Exh. A). The respondent has submitted a receipt showing that he paid the amount required for the filing (Mot. Exh. A). The respondent states that Mr. Hernandez advised him that the case would take a long time (Mot. at 2-3). The respondent reports that Mr. Hernandez did not file anything on the respondent’s behalf and that he was suspended from the practice of law by the Florida Bar at the time he entered into the agreement with the respondent to file the petition for review (Mot. at 2-3; Mot. Exh. B). The respondent also states that he now believes the attorney should have filed a motion to reconsider with the Board. The respondent reports that he has obtained the services of a criminal attorney, who specializes in post-conviction relief, to assist him with his criminal conviction, and that once the conviction is addressed, the respondent will be eligible for relief from removal. The respondent has submitted a copy of a visa petition (Form I-130) and evidence that his wife is a United States citizen (Mot. Exh. D).
 
*2 Accepting the respondent’s allegations concerning his former attorney, Michael J. Hernandez, it is extremely unfortunate that the respondent was apparently cheated out of a substantial amount of money. However, the respondent has not made any allegation that the result in his case might have been different if Mr. Hernandez had filed the promised petition for review, or in the alternative filed a motion to reconsider with the Board. It was determined during proceedings that the respondent was not eligible for the relief he sought, based on his controlled substance conviction. The respondent makes no challenge to the findings of the Board or the Immigration Judge. Thus, even though the Board may consider, as a matter of discretion, claims of ineffective assistance based on conduct that occurred after the final order of removal was entered, the respondent has not shown that this is a case that warrants reopening. See Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A.G. 2009).
 
To the extent the respondent speculates that his criminal conviction might be vacated in the future, this is not related to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and is not a basis for reopening. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1992) (providing that motions to reopen must establish prima facie eligibility for relief).
 
Finally, the respondent has submitted a supplemental filing with evidence concerning his work-place injury on April 19, 2006. He states that the injury was the subject of a workers compensation claim. He also makes references to a “U Visa” application in relationship to the claim, but he does not explain how any such application would be a basis for reopening or how it would constitute an exception to the 90-day filing requirement.
 
The respondent has not established that his untimely motion to reopen should be granted, and the motion will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal pending adjudication of the motion is moot.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

File: AXXX XX0 436 - Detroit, MI

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
George P. Mann, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael B. Dobson
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on December 6, 2011, when we affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge dated August 12, 2010, which denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the proceedings.1 On January 4, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider our decision. The motion to reconsider will be granted and the appeal is dismissed. The request for refund of the motion fee is denied. The request for oral argument is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7).
 
We review the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether or not the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Iraq, seeks reconsideration by the Board of its December 6, 2011, decision. He alleges we erred in stating he did not submit an appellate brief and, with his motion to reconsider, he has provided a copy of a brief he submitted to the Board concerning his previous appeal. The brief is date stamped indicating that it was received timely by the Board, but it was not associated with the respondent’s record of proceeding. In our previous decision, we stated that no brief had been submitted, but we considered the arguments raised by the respondent previously in his motions to reopen and to reconsider filed with the Immigration Judge (BIA, Dec. 6, 2011, at 2).
 
A motion to reconsider is “a request that the Board reexamine its previous decision in light of additional arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked.” Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57 (BIA 2006). A motion to reconsider challenges the Board’s original decision and alleges that it is defective in some regard. Id. The motion must specify the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision, and it must be supported by pertinent authority. See section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(c)(6)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). Thus, given that the respondent’s appellate brief was overlooked, we grant his motion to reconsider.
 
In his brief, the respondent argues that the previous order of removal entered in absentia should be rescinded. He argues that he has presented exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear as he was ineffectively served by previous counsel and suffered a panic attack concerning his appearance in Immigration Court. He also argues that he is eligible for cancellation of removal and asylum based on changed country conditions in his native Iraq. After considering the arguments raised in the brief, we will again dismiss the appeal.
 
*2 We have reconsidered our December 6, 2011, decision based on the respondent’s appellate brief. We conclude that he has essentially presented the same arguments raised in his previous motions that we considered at the time of our previous decision. As we found previously, he has failed to support his arguments concerning any ineffective assistance of counsel during the earlier proceedings nor has he complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Compean, Bangley & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). Further, we continue to find that the respondent has failed to show that any anxiety or panic attacks he suffered due to his fear of removal present exceptional circumstances that excuse his failure to appear for his hearing. See Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33 (BIA 1998); see also Scorteanu v. INS, 339 F.3d 407, 411 (6th Cir. 2003) (respondent bears burden of proof to show exceptional circumstances). The respondent’s perfunctory statements concerning his panic attacks, with no detail concerning the severity or evidence of treatment, fail to support his burden of showing exceptional circumstances. See Matter of J-P-, supra. As we are dismissing the appeal from the denial of the motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order and the respondent is currently not in the United States, he has not shown any eligibility for relief and the appeal will be dismissed. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose M. Guerrero, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 15, 2011. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider the denial of her motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia. On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by not finding that her failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances. The respondent’s appeal will be sustained and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Upon de novo review, we disagree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2); 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). According to the evidence in the record, the respondent relied on the advice of her counsel’s office that she did not need to appear for her scheduled hearing. Hence, we find that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel, which prevented the respondent from attending her scheduled hearing before the Immigration Judge.
 
Inasmuch as the respondent has demonstrated that she received ineffective assistance of counsel, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen and remand the record to the Immigration Judge to provide the respondent with a hearing regarding her removability from the United States and eligibility for relief from removal. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
*2 FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maria Ines Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This matter was most recently before us on June 19, 2012, when this Board denied the respondent’s previous untimely motion to reopen his removal proceedings. This motion was filed on July 17, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent characterizes this motion as a motion to reconsider the Board’s previous decision. A motion to reconsider is one which identifies a material error of fact or law in the decision for which reconsideration is being requested. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). The respondent’s motion does not identify any errors of fact or law in the prior decision. Instead, the motion seeks to introduce additional evidence in support of the respondent’s prior motion, which sought reopening based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, this motion is actually in the style of the respondent’s second, untimely motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent’s prior motion was denied because the untimeliness of the motion was not related to the ineffective assistance, because the respondent had not shown due diligence, because the respondent had not substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and because the respondent had not included the documents which his prior attorney should ostensibly have submitted at the trial level. This motion is accompanied by the respondent’s affidavit and the evidence which he claims should have been submitted to the Immigration Judge. The affidavit generally states that the respondent “contacted [his] attorney at the time afterwards” and was “assured” that “he would have this matter reopened” (Motion, Tab A). He further states that after his prior attorney was “convicted” the respondent “saw many attorneys who told [him] that there was no possibility of re-opening” the case (Id). The respondent’s affidavit does not provide clear details regarding what transpired between the time of his final hearing on April 1, 2005, and the filing of his first motion with the Board on February 8, 2012.
 
These general, vague allegations do not persuade us that equitable tolling of the time and number limits is warranted. Alzaarir v. Att’y Gen., 639 F.3d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 2011). As noted in the Board’s prior decision, the respondent was aware at the trial level that his attorney neglected to submit pertinent documents, and the respondent raised allegations of ineffective assistance through new counsel during the course of his appeal. The respondent has not meaningfully explained why he was unable to make a timely motion to reopen, or comply with Lozada’s procedural requirements during the course of his appeal. His claim that he “saw many attorneys” who refused to file a motion is undercut by his ability to gain new counsel for his appeal who filed a motion to remand which alleged ineffective assistance. We again conclude the respondent has not established that the ineffective assistance is tied to the untimeliness or number-barred nature of this motion, and that the respondent has not established due diligence. This motion to reopen will be denied as untimely and number-barred.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas Jalaie, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board in 2005 when we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying a previous motion to reopen these proceedings, in which the respondent was ordered removed in absentia in 2001. The respondent has filed another untimely motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence that is material to the respondent’s claims. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57-58 (BIA 2006); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Because the respondent has not submitted evidence with the motion, it will be denied for not complying with the regulatory requirements for motions to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Even if we considered the merits of the motion, it would be denied, as a motion to reopen is not an opportunity to repeat previously rejected arguments. See INS v. Wang, 450 U.S. 139, 141 (1981) (discussing motions to reopen); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991). Nor has the respondent meaningfully raised ineffective assistance of counsel, where he has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), or shown prejudice.
 
Further, the respondent has not demonstrated an exceptional situation warranting the exercise of our discretion to reopen the proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay is denied as moot.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lena Golovnin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This is the respondent’s fifth motion before the Board and it will be denied as untimely and number barred. This case was last before the Board on February 29, 2012, when we denied the respondent’s untimely and number barred motion to reopen these removal proceedings. The final administrative order in these proceedings was entered on July 22, 2003, almost a decade ago. With certain exceptions, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the administratively final order, and only one may be filed. Sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A) & (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until June 15, 2012, and its supplemental filings on July 9 and September 12, 2012. The motion to reopen and its supplements are filed years out of time and are number-barred. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion.
 
The respondent claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at the time his appeal was dismissed by the Board in 2003. He asserts counsel failed to file a timely petition for review of our decision or a timely motion to reopen these proceedings. The respondent therefore claims he is entitled to equitable tolling of the filing deadline for a motion to reopen. However, even if the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements to establish ineffective assistance of counsel as required in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), he has not demonstrated due diligence in his filing of the instant motion or his prior motions. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008); see also Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 135 (2d Cir. 2000). The respondent has not explained his actions in waiting more than 9 years after the issuance of the final order, or even 3 years after his first untimely motion to reopen was denied by this Board, to file the ineffective assistance claim. Moreover, the respondent has not shown how he was prejudiced by prior counsel’s actions. The respondent has not established that he was not removable as charged, that he would be eligible to pursue adjustment of status in these proceedings, or that he did not have a fair hearing on his application for asylum, withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. In short, he has not shown that the outcome of these proceedings would be different but for the actions of prior counsel.
 
*2 The respondent also has not presented any evidence of changed country conditions in order to except him from the time and number restrictions in filing his motion to reopen.
 
Finally, the respondent has not demonstrated an exceptional situation that warrants our reopening sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied as untimely and number-barred.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: OSWAIN BRENTNOL WALCOTT
File: AXXX XX2 779 - Lumpkin, GA
September 19, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board when we returned the record to the Immigration Court, because we found that the respondent waived appeal through counsel. Thus, the Immigration Judge’s decision ordering the respondent removed to Guyana became the final administrative order. The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider our decision and reopen proceedings.1 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
A party seeking reconsideration requests that the Board’s original decision be reexamined in light of alleged legal or factual errors, a change of law, or an argument that was overlooked. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The respondent has not identified errors of fact or law in our prior decision. Instead, the respondent repeats the arguments he previously made to the Board. Compare Respondent’s Motion with Respondent’s Notice of Appeal, attached statement. We considered these arguments and found them unpersuasive before concluding that the respondent waived appeal through counsel. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 58 (stating that “a motion to reconsider is not a process by which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief presented on appeal ....”). As we explained, ineffective assistance is not clear from the record, and the respondent did not comply with the procedural requirements for raising such a claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Nor, for reasons set forth, did his filing reflect circumstances that warranted review of the Immigration Judge’s decision by certification. Thus, while the respondent may disagree with our decision, he has presented no arguments that convince us of a factual or legal error, or an appellate argument that we overlooked.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen will also be denied. Notwithstanding the respondent’s recent partial compliance with Matter of Lozada - filing a complaint with prior counsel’s state bar - the respondent has still not shown that counsel’s alleged deficient performance resulted in prejudice. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005) (concluding that an alien must show prejudice when he advances an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and that “[p]rejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different”). Neither the respondent’s present or previous filing included proffered evidence reflecting prima facie evidence of United States citizenship. Additionally, the respondent has presented no evidence that his criminal conviction underlying these proceedings has been overturned or that a state court has otherwise found ineffective assistance by the respondent’s defense counsel of the type in Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010). Finally, the respondent has not alleged or demonstrated prima facie eligibility for relief from removal.
 
*2 The respondent has submitted a photocopy of a portion of a detention center computer-based mailing log and submits that his notice of appeal would have been timely but for unspecified administrative errors within the detention center’s mailing system. However, even if the respondent had timely filed the Notice of Appeal, it would not impact our conclusion that he waived appeal through counsel. A respondent who waives appeal cannot thereafter file an appeal. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a)(1) (final sentence), 1003.39.
 
Finally, we do not find an adequate basis for reconsidering our previous decision or reopening the case sua sponte. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
N. Jude Menes, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cynthia D. Goodman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 22, 2010 decision denying his motion to reopen. The respondent filed his motion with the Immigration Judge on December 2, 2010 while claiming that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at the time of the Immigration Judge’s August 5, 2010 pre-conclusion voluntary departure grant under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We hold that the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. In particular, while the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge improperly focused on the untimely nature of his motion in light of his prior counsel’s ineffective assistance (i.e., which may toll the filing deadline for his motion), we find that his claim for reopening should be denied as he failed to show any prejudice given that he is not currently eligible for any form of relief (Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Br. at 1). See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988) (an applicant seeking reopening must establish prima facie eligibility for the underlying relief sought).
 
The respondent maintains that his former counsel failed to appear in court for his master calendar hearing--which allegedly led to the respondent accepting voluntary departure despite lacking full understanding of its implications--and that such counsel falsely promised various forms of immigration relief, actions which ultimately deprived the respondent of “an opportunity to present the bona fides of his valid and legitimate marriage to a U.S. citizen” (Respondent’s Br. at 4-6, 10-11). Even accepting the respondent’s contention that he substantively complied with the procedural requirements described in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not established prejudice from the actions of his prior counsel as he has not provided any evidence showing that the outcome of his case might have been different if such counsel acted with sufficient competence. See U.S. v. Herrera, 412 F.3d 577, 580 (5th Cir. 2005) (noting that in order to prove prejudice, an applicant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different) (internal citations omitted). In particular, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s argument that had his counsel been effective, the respondent would have presented evidence demonstrating that his marriage was legitimate as he has not addressed, much less reconciled, the fact that the DHS previously issued an intent to deny his wife’s petition for alien relative (Form I-130) that was filed on his behalf upon concluding that their marriage was not bona fide and that it was entered into for the purpose of evading immigration laws (Exh. 2; Respondent’s Br. at 8, 11). See, e.g., Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009); Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). While the respondent further states that he and his wife remain married and that another I-130 petition that was filed on his behalf is pending with the DHS, we are not inclined to remand the matter for additional proceedings to await adjudication of such a petition based on the particular facts of this case (Respondent’s Br. at 12-13). See generally Morgan v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 549, 552 (2d Cir. 2006) (finding no abuse of discretion in the denial of a continuance for adjudication of a second visa petition when the first I-130 filed by the same petitioner was denied by the USCIS for failure to establish a bona fide marriage).
 
*2 To the extent the respondent contends that his former counsel misrepresented his eligibility for asylum, the respondent has not presented any intelligible argument suggesting that he may be able to demonstrate eligibility for asylum or any other form of relief (Respondent’s Br. at 8). See, e.g., Matter of Almanza, 24 I&N Dec. 771 (BIA 2009) (the burden is on the respondent to establish eligibility for relief). As we see no evidence before us indicating that a remand of the proceedings might lead to a different result in this matter, the respondent’s charges of ineffective assistance of counsel do not undermine the Immigration Judge’s finding of removability or underlying decision.
 
Further, while the respondent has filed supplemental evidence on appeal, we may not accept these documents into the record as we are precluded from engaging in fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003-1(d)(3)(iv). Even considering such information, the respondent has not identified any specific evidence which, if presented, would have affected the proceeding below, nor has he illustrated how the Immigration Judge’s decision remains incomplete or defective. As such, the respondent has not established that a remand is warranted for any reason. See Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031 (BIA 1999). We also find that the circumstances presented by the respondent are not “exceptional” as to justify a sua sponte reopening of the matter (Respondent’s Br. at 11-12). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). To the extent that the respondent seeks a stay of removal, he has not shown why the execution of his removal order should be stayed and we accordingly deny his request in this regard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(f). Accordingly, based on the foregoing, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
K. Thomas Li, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carrie E. Johnston
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of China, was ordered removed in absentia on March 8, 2004. On January 15, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings, which the Immigration Judge denied on June 26, 2009. The respondent filed a timely appeal of that decision. The appeal will be sustained, proceedings will be reopened and the record will be remanded.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen finding that his motion was untimely and did not warrant sua sponte reopening. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied.
 
Upon review, we find that in light of the circumstances presented in this case, including evidence reflecting that the respondent’s former counsel provided ineffective assistance with respect to the respondent’s application for adjustment of status which resulted in the issuance of the Notice to Appear and the respondent being placed into proceedings as well as his direction to the respondent not to appear at his March 8, 2004, hearing, we will allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for a hearing. We note that the respondent acted diligently upon discovering his former counsel’s deficient performance. In reaching this conclusion, we further note that he respondent is the beneficiary of an approved I-130.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

File: AXXX XX3 185 - Los Angeles, CA
August 24, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On August 21, 2009, the respondent failed to appear for his removal hearing and was ordered removed in absentia by the Immigration Judge. The respondent subsequently filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, which was denied in a November 3, 2010, decision. The respondent appealed the Immigration Judge’s denial, but the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal in a June 28, 2011, decision. On July 26, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board based on the alleged ineffectiveness of his former counsel. For the reasons set out below, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on June 28, 2011. Generally, a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision, and only one may be filed. Sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i)ofthe Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A) & (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). A request for rescission of an in absentia order of removal based on “exceptional circumstances” must be filed within 180 days after the date that the order of removal is issued. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3) and 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The present motion was filed on July 26, 2012, well beyond the filing deadlines. In addition, the respondent previously filed a motion to reopen that was denied by the Immigration Judge on November 3, 2010.
 
However, aliens raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a motion can have the time limits on motions equitably tolled. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). Aliens relying on equitable tolling have the burden of demonstrating that they exercised due diligence in discovering the fraud or error.
 
We find that the respondent’s untimely and number-barred motion to reopen does not qualify for equitable tolling. The respondent has not demonstrated that he exercised the requisite diligence in filing the instant motion. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on August 21, 2009, and on June 28, 2011, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s November 3, 2010, decision denying his motion to reopen. However, the respondent waited until July 26, 2012, to file the instant motion, and has not specified what he did between June 28 2011, and July 26, 2012, to protect his rights or when he definitely learned of his prior counsel’s incompetence. Given the lack of evidence regarding the steps he took to preserve his rights from June 2011 to July 2012, we find that the respondent did not act with due diligence. See Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090, 1096 (9th Cir. 2007) (refusing to toll where immigrant failed to investigate suspicions of incompetence for 6 months). In any event, the respondent has not submitted the requisite application for relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).
 
*2 We alternatively find that the respondent has not substantially complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).1 See generally, Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893 (9th Cir. 2008). The respondent has not included a personal affidavit or any correspondence to his prior counsel regarding his allegations of ineffectiveness. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598-99 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding that alien did not comply with Lozada where he did not submit an affidavit and did not provide former counsel with an adequate opportunity to respond to allegation). The respondent also has not filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority nor adequately explained why he has not done so.
 
Finally, the respondent has not shown that an “exceptional situation” exists that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s request for a stay is denied.

Under Matter of Lozada, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must satisfy the following procedural requirements: (1) an affidavit of the alien attesting to the relevant facts, including a detailed description of the agreement with former counsel, (2) former counsel must be informed of the allegations and provided with an opportunity to respond, and (3) indicate whether a complaint has been filed the appropriate disciplinary authority, and if not, why not.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Shan D. Potts, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On March 22, 2012, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to terminate these removal proceedings. On May 9, 2012, the respondent filed the instant timely motion to reopen to enable him to apply for adjustment of status based on an approved immediate relative visa petition, dated October 30, 2006, classifying him as the parent of a United States citizen. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a statement opposing this motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g). The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent, who was previously represented by the above-named attorney before the Immigration Judge and the Board, now claims that he did not pursue an application for adjustment of status previously in these proceedings due to ineffective assistance of counsel. We find that ineffective assistance of counsel in handling the respondent’s potential eligibility for adjustment is sufficiently clear on the face of the record that reopening is warranted even without full compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Rodriguez-Lariz v. I.N.S., 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002). Accordingly, the respondent’s timely, unopposed motion to reopen will be granted, and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order of removal in the respondent’s case on July 28, 2011, and on June 27, 2012, the respondent filed the instant motion with the Board. Whether construed as a motion to reopen or as a motion to reconsider, the respondent’s motion is untimely. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991) (discussing motions to reopen and motions to reconsider); sections 240(c)(6)(B), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6)(B), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(b)(2), (c)(2). The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent has raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the instant motion. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the Board). He specifically claims that his former attorney did not properly contest on appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision finding him removable as charged and ineligible for relief; did not file a timely motion to reopen the proceedings; and did not file a timely petition for judicial review of the Board’s prior order.
 
The filing deadline imposed on motions to reopen may be equitably tolled where the motion is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Jin Bo Zhao v. I.N.S., 452 F.3d 154, 160 (2nd Cir. 2006). In order to prevail on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, however, the respondent must substantially comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2nd Cir. 2005). (“[A]n alien who has failed to comply substantially with the Lozada requirements in her motion to reopen before the BIA forfeits her ineffective assistance of counsel claim”).
 
Before allegations of ineffective assistance of former counsel are presented to the Board, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. In the present case, the respondent has failed to comply with Lozada’s notice requirement. There is no evidence now before the Board to show that the respondent has made any attempt to inform his former attorney of the allegations against her, or that his former attorney has otherwise been made aware of the allegations. Further, the respondent has not explained why he has not properly notified his former attorney of the allegations against her. Id.
 
*2 In certain circumstances, “slavish adherence” to the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, is unnecessary. See Ruiz-Martinez v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 102, 121 (2d Cir.2008). In the respondent’s case, however, ineffective assistance of counsel is not apparent on the face of the record. See YiLong Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133, 143 (2nd Cir.2007). Under the circumstances, we find that the respondent has failed to substantially comply with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board. See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, supra.
 
Inasmuch as the respondent has not set forth a viable ineffective assistance of counsel claim, equitable tolling of the filing deadlines is not warranted in this case. Further, no exception to the filing deadline imposed on motions to reopen appears to apply to this motion, and no exceptional situation has been shown to be present in this case to warrant the exercise of the Board’s limited authority to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(a), (c)(3). Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen and reconsider will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and reconsider is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Margaret W. Wong, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael A. Tripi
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 29, 2011. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings. We find that the respondent’s contention that his in absentia order of removal should be vacated because he had departed the United States prior to his removal hearing is without merit. In Matter of Brown, 18 I&N Dec. 324, 325 (BIA 1982), the Board held that an alien “cannot compel the termination of deportation proceedings which have been commenced against him merely by effecting a departure and reentry.” Once jurisdiction was vested with the Immigration Judge by the filing of the Notice to Appear (Form I-862), the Immigration Judge obtained jurisdiction and the respondent remained subject to removal proceedings, even though he departed the United States and re-entered. Hence, when the respondent did not appear for his scheduled removal hearing, we find that the Immigration Judge properly entered an order of removal.1
 
To the extent that the respondent argues that his failure to appear for his hearing was due to ineffective assistance of counsel, we find that the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C) (requiring that motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances be filed within 180 days of the date of the order of removal). Moreover, the respondent has not fully complied with the procedural requirements for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).2
 
Furthermore, we find that the respondent has not established that his motion should be granted pursuant to our sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). The respondent has not demonstrated an exceptional situation sufficient to warrant reopening of his removal proceedings. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
Ana Mann

To the extent that the respondent references an unpublished Board decision finding to the contrary, we note that this Board is not bound by its unpublished decisions.

2

We would apply similar reasoning affirming the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen if the respondent had simply been ordered removed instead of being ordered removed in absentia. The respondent’s motion to reopen was not filed within 90 days of his order of removal and the respondent has not demonstrated that his motion is subject to any exception to the filing deadline. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Francisco Javier Aldana, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ted Y. Yamada
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, was ordered removed in absentia on June 9, 2011. On June 13, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings, which the Immigration Judge denied on August 15, 2011. The respondent filed a timely appeal of that decision. The appeal will be sustained, proceedings will be reopened and the record will be remanded.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen finding that he had received proper notice for his June 9, 2011, hearing. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied.
 
Upon review, we find that in view of the above and in light of the totality of circumstances presented in this case, including evidence reflecting that the respondent’s counsel conceded that he provided ineffective assistance by failing to appear at the June 9, 2011, hearing, we will allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for a hearing.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

*1 This case has been the subject of two prior Board decisions. In the Board’s decision on September 21, 2011, the appeal was dismissed, and a motion to remand based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was denied. In denying the motion to remand, the Board found that there had been no compliance with the threshold procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, noting that more than one year had elapsed since the appeal was filed. On March 9, 2012, the Board denied a motion for reconsideration of the September 21, 2011, decision and a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance before the Immigration Judge, finding that the respondent and current counsel could have pursued an ineffective assistance of counsel claim with Lozada compliance before the Immigration Judge or on appeal. See Tr. at 12-13. The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider the Board’s decisions on March 9, 2012, and September 21, 2011. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2), only one motion to reconsider a Board decision is permitted, and a party may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider. Consequently, the respondent’s second motion for reconsideration of the September 21, 2011, decision, and motion for reconsideration of the March 9, 2012, denial of reconsideration will be denied. The respondent also has not shown that reconsideration of the March 2012 denial of reopening is warranted, as there is no legal or factual defect in the decision denying reopening. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The respondent’s tactical decision to delay pursuit of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and/or compliance with the procedural threshold requirements for such a claim is not tantamount to showing that evidence in support of such a claim could not have been obtained and presented at the hearing below. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
ORDER: The motion for reconsideration is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The final administrative order of removal in these proceedings was entered by the Board on August 31, 2006. On April 27, 2012, alleging ineffective of former counsels, the respondent, a native and citizen of Belize, filed the pending motion to reopen. However, the motion is untimely filed and has not been shown to qualify for any exception to the filing requirements imposed on motions to reopen removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Moreover, we decline to equitably toll the applicable filing deadlines. The respondent does not specifically contend that she was unaware of the Board’s August 31, 2006, decision. Nor does she specially assert or indicate in any way that the alleged action or inaction of former counsels prevented her from timely filing the instant motion. Indeed, she does not dispute that she was aware of the alleged deficient performances of former counsels prior to the Board’s August 31, 2006, decision. Under the circumstances, particularly where, as here, first former counsel describes the respondent’s lack of cooperation in pursuing her claim, we do not find that the respondent has sufficiently demonstrated that she received ineffective assistance. Nor has she sufficiently complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against each of her former counsels, including the requirement that she show prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra; Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). Nor has there been any showing of due diligence in pursuing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra.
 
On this record, the respondent has not provided us with an adequate reason to excuse the untimeliness of her motion. Nor has she demonstrated any exceptional circumstance that would warrant the reopening of these proceedings under the Board’s discretionary sua sponte authority. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion and related request for a stay of removal are denied.1

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bibiana C. Andrade, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Angela Marra
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On October 31, 2011, the Board entered the final administrative order in this case, and on February 29, 2012, the Board denied the respondent’s previous motion to reopen. On March 29, 2012, the respondent filed the instant untimely, number-barred motion to reopen. See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent now raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). He alleges prejudicial error on the part of his former attorney because she entered pleading on his behalf, thereby admitting to his being removable under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (present without being admitted or paroled), thus precluding his eligibility for adjustment of status. He specifically argues that his former attorney should have denied the allegation that the respondent is an alien present in the United States without being admitted and paroled because he was paroled into the United States pursuant to a grant of advanced parole under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Act.
 
It is undisputed that the respondent first entered the United States without inspection on or about March 15, 1999, as alleged in the Notice to Appear, and that he was subsequently authorized to be paroled upon his return to the United States to pursue a pending application for adjustment of status. The fact that the respondent was paroled into the United States pursuant to a grant of advanced parole does not, under the circumstances, render the respondent admissible. See Ibragimov v. Gonzales, 476 F.3d 125 (2nd Cir. 2007); Matter of G-A-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 83, 88-89 (BIA 1998) (explaining that section 212(d)(5) of the Act makes clear that the parole shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(e)(2)(i). In the present case, the respondent was properly placed in removal proceedings and charged with inadmissibility following the denial by the DHS of his application for adjustment of status on August 8, 2003, and the revocation of his parole.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the respondent has not established that he suffered prejudice as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rabiu v. I.N.S., 41 F.3d 879, 882-83 (2nd Cir. 1994); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640. Therefore, equitable tolling of the filing restrictions imposed on this motion is not warranted. See Iavorski v. U.S. I.N.S., 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000). Further, it does not appear that any exception to the filing restrictions applies to this motion or that any exceptional situation is present in this case to warrant the exercise of the Board’s sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(a), (c)(3). Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely, number-barred motion to reopen will be denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maria Ines Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Patricia M. Medeiros
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before us on July 20, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his request for a remand based on allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. This motion, filed on February 8, 2012, is not timely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security opposes reopening. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We construe this as an argument that the time limits on motions should be equitably tolled. The time limits on motions may be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance where an alien establishes that he was prejudiced by the misconduct, and where he has shown due diligence in discovering and correcting the errors. See Alzaarir v. Att’y Gen., 639 F.3d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 2011).
 
We are not persuaded that equitable tolling is warranted in this case.
 
First, the purported ineffective assistance all occurred at the trial level, and as the respondent knew of the ostensible failures of his prior counsel at that time the untimeliness of this motion is not related to the ineffective assistance. Accordingly, equitable tolling does not apply.
 
Second, the respondent has not shown due diligence in this case. He previously raised these arguments of ineffective assistance during the course of his appeal 6 years ago and requested a remand. We denied the respondent’s request for a remand because he failed to submit the necessary corroborative evidence. The respondent has not provided any explanation for why he waited over 5 years to submit another motion.
 
The respondent’s motion does not substantially comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). He has not provided evidence of his agreement with his former attorney, he has not indicated whether he has submitted a bar complaint, and there is no evidence that the former attorney has been notified of these allegations. The respondent’s arguments relating to ineffective assistance rest primarily on his former attorney’s suspension, seemingly in an unrelated matter, which does not establish that there was ineffective assistance in this case.
 
Finally, the respondent has not included the documents which his prior attorney should ostensibly have obtained and submitted. Without being able to examine the proffered evidence, we are unable to conclude that the respondent was prejudiced in any respect.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Genet Getachew, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision issued June 27, 2011, denying her request to reopen proceedings after she was ordered removed in absentia.1 The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a brief or other response. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including credibility findings, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews de novo all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges, including legal and discretionary determinations and applications of law to fact. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear at the February 8, 2011, hearing. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). The respondent on appeal has not challenged the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent did not comply with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See generally Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996) (finding that ineffective assistance of counsel may amount to “exceptional circumstances” in the context of a motion to reopen an in absentia removal order).2 The respondent has not identified the individual whom she claims purported to be able to assist her, or whether or not the individual was an attorney or otherwise authorized to represent her under section 8 C.F.R. § 1292.1. The record does not contain a Form EOIR-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative before the Immigration Court, or other evidence of representation or agreement with the respondent. To the extent the respondent’s attorney on appeal makes general assertions about the individual and the respondent’s experiences, statements of counsel are not evidence. See, e.g., INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980).
 
In the event that the individual was a non-attorney, the extent to which the Matter of Lozada requirements are mandated is an unsettled question, but some compliance has been required, generally of the first two steps. See Omar v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 647, 651 (2d Cir. 2008); Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87, 94-95 (BIA 2007) (finding that the respondent satisfied the concerns underlying Matter of Lozada where she submitted to the Board a copy of a formal complaint provided to her accredited representative, whose representation and specific action had been described to the Board, and apparently offered the accredited representative an opportunity to respond). In contrast, the respondent in the instant matter has not identified the individual or the capacity in which he or she presented his or her ability to assist the respondent, the nature of the agreement between the individual and the respondent, any proof of payment, what specific representations the individual made to the respondent about her immigration proceedings, or what the individual said, if anything, specifically about the February 8, 2011, hearing at which the respondent was ordered removed in absentia. The respondent has also not provided evidence that a formal complaint was provided to the individual with an opportunity to respond.
 
*2 Furthermore, the respondent has not established that she was prejudiced by the individual’s actions. See Omar v. Mukasey, supra, at 51 (finding no error where the Board determined that the respondent had presented neither sufficient compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, to whatever extent it may be required for non-attorneys, nor prejudice from the alleged actions); see also Matter of Assaad, supra, at 561-62. The respondent has not demonstrated that she would have attended the February 8, 2011, hearing but for the advice of the individual. We note that the respondent, to whom the Notice to Appear with the time, date, and location of the Immigration Court hearing was mailed, has not argued that she did not have notice of the hearing (Exh. 1). The respondent’s statement provided with the motion to reopen does not indicate that she was advised to not attend the hearing. Moreover, the respondent has not contested the ground of removability under section 237(a)(1)(D)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i), nor demonstrated eligibility for any form of relief, including voluntary departure which she mentioned briefly in the motion to reopen. We therefore conclude that the respondent has not shown prejudice based upon the alleged ineffectiveness of the unidentified individual.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Counsel for the respondent has not filed a separate written brief or statement, despite indicating on the Notice of Appeal that a brief would be submitted and despite seeking and receiving a briefing extension. We considered the statements on the Notice of Appeal as the basis of the respondent’s appeal, although they lack specificity. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(A), (E) (permitting summary dismissal in express situations, including failure to file a brief as indicated).

Under Matter of Lozada, supra, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be supported by (1) an affidavit setting out the agreement entered into with counsel, (2) proof that notice of the allegations and an opportunity to respond has been provided to counsel whose representation was allegedly ineffective, and (3) the filing of a complaint with appropriate disciplinary authorities or an explanation for the failure to file a complaint. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 561-62 (BIA 2003) (requiring prejudice stemming from prior counsel’s actions in addition to compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra).

IN RE: VICTOR MANUEL RAMIREZ-RAMIREZ
File: AXXX XX0 382 - Los Angeles, CA
June 14, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vera A. Weisz, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
In a decision dated May 10, 2011, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed to Mexico after determining that he had not been cooperating with his attorney and was not eligible for relief other than voluntary departure; the Immigration Judge denied voluntary departure as a matter of discretion. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that his prior attorney who represented him before the Immigration Judge failed to explore all of the respondent’s immigration remedies and poorly advised him, including telling him to inform the Immigration Judge that he needed more time because he was getting married, when in reality he was not (Respondent’s Br. at 1, 3, 6-8). He argues that his former attorney did not raise the issue of the respondent qualifying for a U visa and his counselor withdrew from the case when the respondent refused to make a false claim of political asylum (Respondent’s Br. at 6, 8).
 
The respondent does not claim to have met the procedural requirements for establishing a prima facie case of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating that in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must establish and include the following: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not); see also Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999) (stating that the Lozada requirements “insures that the record contains the ‘essential information’ necessary to ‘evaluate the substance’ of the alien’s claim”).
 
While the respondent is correct that strict compliance with Lozada’s procedural requirements for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not required in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, particularly where the record reflects a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel” (Respondent’s Br. at 6), we do not find this to be the case here. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). The fact that the respondent did not comply with the Lozada requirements precludes any presumption that the respondent was provided with ineffective assistance of counsel. Additionally, although the respondent alleges that his prior counsel told him to lie to the Immigration Judge about getting married and advised him to file a false asylum application, there is no proof that his prior counsel was actively engaging in fraud. With such allegations, it would be particularly helpful if the respondent did notify his counsel of these allegations and submitted a response from the attorney in order to facilitate the evaluation of such conduct.
 
*2 Nevertheless, there is no evidence that the respondent was prejudiced by his former attorney’s actions such that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case or from applying for relief which would have been available to him. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating that ineffective assistance of counsel results in a denial of due process under the Fifth Amendment only when the proceeding is so fundamentally unfair that the alien is prevented from reasonable presenting his case); see also Rodriguez-Gonzalez v. INS, 640 F.2d 1139, 1142 (9th Cir. 1981) (stating that legal strategies which are unwise in hindsight do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel). The respondent has not established that the proceedings would have been different but for his counsel’s alleged unprofessional errors. The respondent’s prior counsel appears to have asked to withdraw from representing the respondent during a preliminary hearing but was asked to remain of counsel to give the respondent another opportunity to file applications for relief (Tr. at 17-19). At the next hearing, the respondent still had not presented any applications, after being explicitly informed by the Immigration Judge that this was his last continuance for filing applications (Tr. at 20-21), and his attorney again alleged a lack of cooperation as grounds for seeking withdrawal (Tr. at 22). The Immigration Judge then found the respondent’s applications abandoned and granted the respondent’s counsel’s request to withdraw (Tr. at 23, 25; I.J. at 2).
 
The respondent does not dispute that he did not submit any applications for relief when asked to by the Immigration Judge, and on appeal, he does not allege or establish that he is eligible for any relief. Therefore, we cannot conclude that, even assuming his attorney ineffective, there was prejudice. Although the respondent claims that his prior counsel should have established his eligibility for a U visa based on being a victim of a crime (Respondent’s Br. at 1-2, 8), the record does not contain sufficient evidence that the respondent would qualify for such a visa or that he has even applied for it. At any rate, we do not have jurisdiction to grant such relief. See Matter of Sanchez Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807 (BIA 2012) (discussing how an alien establishes prima facie eligibility for a U visa and whether a remand or continuance is warranted to await adjudication of such relief).
 
Likewise, although the respondent asserts that he is eligible for “prosecutorial discretion” (Respondent’s Br. at 1, 8), the Board and the Immigration Judges do not have authority to influence or require the Department of Homeland Security to exercise its discretion in deciding which cases to prosecute or not. See Reno v. American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, 525 U.S. 471, 488-91 (1999); Lopez-Telles v. INS, 564 F.2d 1302, 1304 (9th Cir. 1977). Although cancellation of removal was raised as a possible form of relief for which the respondent might be eligible (Tr. at 15), it was ultimately not pursued, and the respondent does not appear statutorily eligible for such relief (see Tr. at 24). See section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). Finally, it is not clear whether the respondent is statutorily eligible for voluntary departure, which the Immigration Judge denied as a matter of discretion (Tr. at 23; I.J. at 2), but the respondent does not raise this issue on appeal and, therefore, we decline to address it further.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kai W. Degraaf, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carrie E. Johnston
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Termination
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s January 18, 2011, oral decision which found her subject to removal as charged. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a response on appeal in support of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2012). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues involving questions of law, judgement and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent, a 55-year-old native and citizen of Philippines, entered the United States in 2003 on a tourist’s visa. She eventually was hired as a live-in nanny by a United States citizen who led her to believe that she would assist her in becoming lawful permanent resident with the assistance of two prior attorneys. However, the petition for alien worker eventually was denied, and a Notice to Appear was issued in March 2009, which alleged that the respondent was subject to removal because she had overstayed her tourist visa. The respondent, through the same attorney who represents her on appeal, conceded the factual allegations and removability on August 31, 2010 (Tr. at 8).
 
On December 7, 2010, the respondent, through counsel, submitted a motion to terminate proceedings setting forth the preceding facts. He alleged that the respondent had been deprived of due process essentially because she had been misled by her employer and the prior attorneys and that the Notice to Appear had been “improvidently issued,” citing 8 C.F.R. § 239.2(a)(6). On December 8, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied the motion via a preprinted order in which he had handwritten that the respondent “has already admitted the allegations and conceded removability as charged.”
 
At a hearing on January 18, 2011, the respondent, through counsel, requested a final order of removal in order that he could pursue the possibility of deferred action, and he conceded that the respondent was not eligible for any form of relief. Therefore, the Immigration Judge entered an order of removal on January 18, 2011.
 
The respondent filed a Notice of Appeal which indicated that she was appealing the Immigration Judge’s removal order of January 18, 2011. However, counsel has submitted a brief on appeal which reiterates the arguments contained in the motion to terminate and alleges again that the Notice to Appear was improvidently issued. The respondent essentially argues that she should not have been placed in removal proceedings because she received ineffective assistance of counsel, without any legal support for this position. In addition, she maintains that she should not be required to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) because the ineffective assistance in her case is plainly apparent.
 
*2 The respondent has misinterpreted the regulations and case law which permit the DHS or an Immigration Judge to cancel a Notice to Appear as improvidently issued. The regulations and case law do not permit an alien to request that a Notice to Appear be cancelled on this basis. See generally Matter of W-C-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 118 (BIA 2007); Matter of G-N-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 281 (BIA 1998); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 239.2(a)(6), (c).
 
In the circumstances, we will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decisions of December 8, 2010, which denied the motion to terminate, and January 18, 2011, which ordered the respondent removed. The respondent was represented by competent counsel who conceded the factual allegations and removability, she has not established that she is eligible for any form of relief, or that she is not subject to removal as charged.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Salvador Delgado, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jon D. Staples
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
 
APPLICATION: Termination; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 28, 2012, decision ordering his removal. During the pendency of his appeal, the respondent has also filed a motion to reopen, which we construe as a motion to remand. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1999). We review findings of fact by the Immigration Judge for clear error, while all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and the motion denied.
 
The respondent concedes that he was convicted of criminal sale of marijuana in violation of New York Penal Law § 221.40 (2004) and of unlawful possession of marijuana in violation of New York Penal Law § 221.05 (2004). However, the respondent challenges the validity of these convictions, and argues that the Immigration Judge should not have relied on such convictions in sustaining the above charges of removability. The respondent also challenges the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that he has been convicted of an aggravated felony.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), as an alien who has any time after admission been convicted of a controlled substance violation, other than a single offense involving possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana. Although the respondent argues on appeal that he was not guilty as charged of the marijuana sale offense, it is well settled that neither an Immigration Judge nor this Board may look behind the fact of conviction and re-litigate the ultimate question of an alien’s guilt or innocence. See Matter of Roberts, 20 I&N Dec. 294 (BIA 1991). Similarly, although the respondent may assert that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during criminal proceedings, the respondent does not indicate that he has successfully pursued a collateral challenge to this offense in state court, and the conviction therefore supports a finding of removability in these proceedings. See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992). Finally, although the respondent states that his convictions may have been expunged from his criminal record pursuant to a rehabilitative statute, an alien remains convicted of an offense for immigration purposes pursuant to the definition of “conviction” set forth in section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A), notwithstanding a subsequent vacatur under a state rehabilitative statute. See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). For these reasons, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has been convicted of two controlled substance violations and is removable under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act.1
 
*2 We do not find merit in the respondent’s Motion to Reopen Deportation Proceedings.2 The respondent’s motion was initially filed with the Immigration Court during the pendency of this appeal. It was properly rejected by the Immigration Court because an Immigration Judge ceases to have jurisdiction over a motion to reopen at such time as jurisdiction vests with this Board. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). A “motion to reopen” is not properly before the Board as the respondent’s motion was filed during the pendency of the present appeal, and thus at a time when there was no administratively final order of removal in his case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1241.1. To the extent that we therefore construe the respondent’s motion as a motion to remand, we conclude that the respondent has not demonstrated that remand is warranted. See Matter of Coelho, supra. While it appears that the respondent argues in his motion that he was inappropriately ordered removed in absentia, we note that the respondent was present and participated at his February 28, 2012, hearing. Further, although the respondent appears to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent has not submitted evidence demonstrating compliance with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (enumerating evidentiary requirements for a party to prevail upon an ineffective assistance of counsel claim). For these reasons, we conclude that the respondent has not shown that remand is warranted in this case. The respondent’s request for a stay or removal is moot, and the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

Because we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, we conclude that we need not reach the Immigration Judge’s aggravated felony determination. We note that the respondent, who was admitted in 2002, cannot establish eligibility for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), because his 2004 convictions preclude him from accruing the required continuous residence. See section 240A(d)(1) of the Act.

We note that the respondent is in removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a, and not deportation proceedings under former section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b.

IN RE: JERMANINE RONNIE SALMON A.K.A. JERMAINE R SALMON A.K.A. TIKI SALMON A.K.A. TIKI R SALMON
File: AXXX XX2 933 - Newark, NJ
June 11, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; voluntary departure
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge dated March 8, 2011, denying his request for a continuance and finding him removable as charged.1 During the pendency of this appeal, the respondent submitted new evidence that we construe as a motion to remand. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). The respondent’s request for a waiver of the filing fees associated with the appeal is granted. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a)(1), 1003.8. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.2
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including any determination of credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should have continued the proceedings since his post-conviction relief (“PCR”) was pending. He further argues that he entered defective guilty pleas due to ineffective assistance from his criminal counsel below, in light of Padilla v. Kentucky, ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct 1473 (2010).3 The respondent contends that his constitutional rights were violated.
 
We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately went forward with the proceedings without granting the respondent an additional continuance (I.J. at 2-4; Tr. at 4-6 dated Mar. 8, 2011). The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, and good cause must be shown for a continuance. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Khan v. Att’y Gen. of the U.S., 448 F.3d 226, 233 (3d Cir. 2006); Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 355-57 (BIA 1983). In this case, the Immigration Judge had continued the proceedings from December 14, 2010, until March 8, 2011, based on the respondent’s testimony that his PCR case for the 2008 conviction had been granted (I.J. at 2-3; see, e.g., Tr. at 31-33 dated Jan. 3, 2011). However, at the March 2011 hearing, the respondent proffered evidence indicating that criminal counsel had been appointed and his PCR case was pending (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 1-3 dated Mar. 8, 2011). The record also reflects that the respondent intended to pursue PCR for his 2007 conviction (Tr. at 5 dated Mar. 8, 2011). Thus, as the respondent’s ability to prevail on his PCR case was speculative, the Immigration Judge appropriately denied his request for a continuance. To date, the respondent has not proffered evidence to suggest that his PCR case for the 2008 conviction will be successful.
 
*2 Further, the fact that the respondent may be pursuing PCR in the form of a collateral attack for his 2008 conviction in state criminal court does not affect its finality for federal immigration purposes. See Paredes v. Att’y Gen. of the U.S., 528 F.3d 196, 198-99 (3d Cir. 2008) (stating the pendency of post-conviction motions or other forms of collateral attacks does not vitiate finality, unless and until the convictions are overturned as a result of the collateral motion); see also Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1034 (BIA 1999). The respondent did not present evidence with this appeal that any attack on his 2008 conviction resulted in any vacatur. Likewise, there is no evidence that the respondent’s 2007 conviction has been vacated. In Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, the United States Supreme Court ruled that an attorney representing an alien in connection with a guilty plea to a criminal offense has a constitutional duty to advise the alien about the risk of deportation arising from the conviction. However, the respondent’s appellate assertions that his convictions are invalid, in light of Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, does not change the finality of his convictions for immigration purposes, unless and until they are overturned by the criminal court.4 See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992); Matter of Ponce De Leon-Ruiz, 21 I&N Dec. 154, 157 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1996). In other words, we are bound by the conviction records and we have no authority to vacate the convictions before us as the judgements do not appear to be a void on their face.
 
The record also does not support the respondent’s contentions that his constitutional rights were violated. To establish a violation of due process, the respondent must demonstrate that he was substantially prejudiced from the alleged procedural errors. See Leslie v. Att’y Gen. of the U.S., 611 F.3d 171, 175-76 (3d Cir. 2010); Khan v. Att’y Gen. of the U.S., supra, at 236. Here, the respondent was afforded a fair hearing to present his claims for relief. The Immigration Judge had continued the proceedings to determine the status of the respondent’s PCR case. The Immigration Judge had also determined that the respondent was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal, that he did not express any fears of persecution or torture if removed to Jamaica, and that he had misplaced his passport and was unable to pay for his travel (Tr. at 3-4, 6 dated Mar. 8, 2011). Based on this record, the respondent did not demonstrate that he was substantially prejudiced by the Immigration Judge, and therefore, we find no violation of due process.
 
*3 For the foregoing reasons, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
To the extent the respondent seeks to apply for voluntary departure under section 240B(b), 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”) and proffers new evidence, we construe it as a motion to remand and we deny the motion. Motions to remand are adjudicated under the same standards as are motions to reopen. See Matter of Ige, 20 I&N Dec. 880, 884 (BIA 1994). Such a motion may not be granted unless the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). A motion to remand must conform to the same standards as a motion to reopen where the respondent seeks to present new evidence, but will only be granted if the new evidence “would likely change the result in the case.” See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992).
 
Although the respondent now asserts that his fiancee holds his passport and that his family can pay for his travel, he has not established by clear and convincing evidence that he has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so. See section 240B(b)(D) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c). The respondent bears the burden of proof to establish eligibility for voluntary departure. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.8(d); 1240.26(c). Aside from the respondent’s conclusory statements, the proffered statements from the respondents’s brother, cousin, father, grandmother, uncle, co-worker, and friends, do not demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent has the financial means to depart voluntarily and intends to do so. See also Matter of Arguelles-Campos, 20 I&N Dec. 811 (BIA 1999). Rather, the proffered statements suggest that the respondent seeks another opportunity to remain in the United States. In his most recent submission filed with the Board on May 4, 2012, the respondent did not present any further evidence to establish that he is prima facie eligible for voluntary departure. Thus, we will deny the respondent’s motion.
 
Due to the nature of our disposition of this matter, we need not address the respondent’s other arguments on appeal and we find no basis to remand this case for further proceedings. See INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25-26 (1976) (stating as a general rule, courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 465 (BIA 2002). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*4 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion is denied.

The respondent does not challenge the portion of the Immigration Judge’s decision regarding his removability, his fears of persecution or torture if removed to Jamaica, or that he was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal (I.J. at 2-4; Exh. 1). We consider these issues to be waived. See Lie v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 530, 532 n.1 (3d Cir. 2005); Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 261 n.1 (BIA 2007); Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191, 196-97 n.4 (BIA 1990).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Michael T. Purcell, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Grace H. Cheung
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondents are natives and citizens of South Korea. This proceeding involved Leland Sustaire, a former federal government employee who obtained lawful permanent resident status for a number of aliens, including the respondents here, even though there was no underlying basis for such status (Exhs. 4-5). The respondents conceded removability and did not seek any relief so the Immigration Judge ordered them removed.
 
The respondents appealed and on March 27, 2006, the Board dismissed the respondents’ appeals. The respondents filed a timely petition for review. On August 10, 2011, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the petition for review. Chee et al. v. Holder, No. 06-71952 (9th Cir. Aug. 8, 2011). The Ninth Circuit held that equitable estoppel against the government was not available where the respondents did not lose any rights to which they were entitled. The Ninth Circuit held that the respondents’ remaining contentions were not persuasive.
 
After receiving the 9th Circuit’s decision, the respondents hired new counsel and on November 17, 2011, they filed a motion to reopen our March 2006 decision. The motion is untimely. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
In the motion, the lead male respondent (AXXX XXX XXX) and his wife (AXXX XXX XXX) request that the Board exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings. Their children (AXXX XXX XXX and AXXX XXX XXX), as well as AXXX XXX XXX on their behalf, contend that their former attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel because they were unaware that they qualified for post-conclusion voluntary departure, and had they known that they qualified, they would have insisted that their former counsel request it, rather than withdraw the request. In addition, AXXX XXX XXX seeks sua sponte reopening so that he may pursue adjustment of status based on an pending I-130 visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife. The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition to the motion.
 
The motion will be denied as untimely. The respondents AXXX XXX XXX and AXXX XXX XXX do not contend that ineffective assistance by former counsel is apparent on the face of the record. As such, the respondents had to substantially comply with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondents attached a complaint and cover letter, but they did not submit sufficient evidence demonstrating that a complaint was filed with the appropriate bar office. The respondents did not attach, or supplement the record, with the certified mail receipt, the return receipt, or an acknowledgment letter from the state bar.
 
*2 Furthermore, even assuming substantial compliance with Lozada, the respondents have not demonstrated that former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondents claim that they were not aware of their eligibility for voluntary departure, and that they would have requested such relief had they been aware. Such an assertion comes 5 years after the Board dismissed the appeal. In light of the record and former counsel’s response, see DHS Opposition, Exh. A, their assertions are inherently not believable. Former counsel states that the respondents AXXX XXX XXX and AXXX XXX XXX did not want to pursue voluntary departure because they wanted to stay and apply for relief (DHS Opposition, Exh. A).
 
According to the transcript of proceedings, former counsel declined voluntary departure on the respondents’ behalf and did not seek any other applications for relief such as adjustment of status based on their labor because they were not eligible for adjustment at the time, but they hoped to seek relief in the future (Tr. at 147-48). Respondents, by their own admissions, were present during this discussion. Further, the respondents did not have a basis for asylum, withholding or protection under the Convention Against Torture (Tr. at 149). Their former counsel’s strategic decisions did not constitute ineffective assistance, but rather a strategic decision based on his understanding of the respondents’ wishes during the proceedings. Torres-Chavez v. Holder, 567 F.3d 1096, 1101 (9th Cir. 2009) (care must be taken to not distort a lawyer’s decisions with the benefit of hindsight).
 
Given the respondents’ (AXXX XXX XXX and AXXX XXX XXX) desire to remain in the United States and their hope to adjust their status, it was a reasonable litigation tactic to withdraw the pending voluntary departure requests as a failure to comply with the stringent time constraints of voluntary departure would result in a bar on adjustment, among other restrictions, for 10 years. Section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d).
 
The respondents AXXX XXX XXX, AXXX XXX XXX, and AXXX XXX XXX seek reopening as a matter of discretion. We decline to exercise our sua sponte discretion to reopen because the respondents have not demonstrated exceptional circumstances. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Becoming eligible for adjustment subsequent to a final administrative order of removal is not unusual and is not by itself an exceptional circumstance.
 
Accordingly, the following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay is denied as moot.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ismael Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Claire W. Matecko
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Egypt, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated February 28, 2011, denying his motion to reconsider. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent was ordered removed in absentia by an Immigration Judge on October 6, 1998. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(6)(A). On October 27, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court. On December 2, 2010, the Immigration Court mailed the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated December 1, 2010, denying the motion to reopen to the parties. On January 4, 2011, 33 days after the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the motion to reopen was mailed, the respondent filed a “Motion to Reconsider Reopening Removal Proceedings” wherein he “move[d] for reconsideration of his motion to reopen removal proceedings” (Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider at 2).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The Immigration Judge properly recognized that the respondent’s motion to reconsider was untimely as it was filed more than 30 days after the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen (I.J. at 2). See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent does not dispute that his motion to reconsider was untimely. See Claudio v. Holder, 601 F.3d 316, 319 (5th Cir. 2010) (holding that once an alien elects in his notice of appeal to file a brief, that brief becomes the operative document through which any issues that the alien wishes to have considered must be raised). While the respondent does claim that his removal would result in hardship to his family and he has other equities in the United States, the power to reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). As such, sua sponte reconsideration was not warranted.
 
On appeal, the respondent attempts to challenge the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his motion to reopen. For example, he argues that the untimeliness of his motion to reopen was justified, that his motion to reopen complied with the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and that he is eligible to adjust status under section 245(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i) (Respondent’s Br. at 1-5).1 However, the respondent did not appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his motion to reopen. As such, any arguments concerning the merits of the motion to reopen are not properly before us. Instead, the only decision currently before us for the purposes of appellate review is the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated February 28, 2011, which properly denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider as untimely. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: JOSUE ELIAS MUNGUIA-SALAZAR
File: AXXX XX4 461 - New Orleans, LA
May 31, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
 
The respondent has filed an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s January 24, 2012, decision granting him voluntary departure. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a response to the respondent’s appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The hearing transcript reveals that the respondent, through counsel, requested only the relief of pre-conclusion voluntary departure for a period of 90 days (Tr. at 7-10), a grant of which requires that the alien waive “appeal of all issues.” Section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D); see also Matter of Ocampo, 22 I&N Dec. 1301 (BIA 2000) (holding that 120 days’ voluntary departure may not be granted prior to the completion of removal proceedings without an express waiver of the right to appeal). The transcript further reflects that, after explaining the order, the Immigration Judge asked the respondent’s counsel whether the respondent waived appeal, to which the respondent’s counsel responded “He does, Your Honor.” (Tr. at 10, lines 9-12).
 
On February 23, 2012, the respondent nevertheless filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26), contending that he was not advised during the proceedings that he was required to waive his appeal rights in order to accept pre-conclusion voluntary departure; and he did not receive an adequate explanation regarding the ramifications of waiving appeal. However, as set out above, the respondent, with counsel present, was explicitly advised that he was required to waive his appeal rights in order to accept pre-conclusion voluntary departure. See Kohwarienv. Holder, 635F. 3d 174 (5th Cir. 2011) (finding that an alien accepting pre-conclusion voluntary departure knowingly and intelligently waived his appellate rights). To the extent the respondent’s appeal can be construed as alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, he has complied with none of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making such a claim. See also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006).
 
Consequently, the respondent, through counsel, knowingly and intelligently waived appeal. The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and that decision remains the final administrative order in these proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a)(1) (final sentence), 1003.39 (finality of order); Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven P. Mock, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Wm. Tracy Hamby
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated January 11, 2010, denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
A motion to reopen must state the new facts that will be proven at the reopened hearing and be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary materials demonstrating prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). An alien who seeks to remand or to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a heavy burden of proving that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. See Matter of Coelho, supra.
 
For the first time on appeal, the respondent alleges that an individual who is not a member of the State Bar of Texas purported to represent him at a scheduling hearing, and for that reason, his counsel of record was uninformed concerning the next pertinent date in the proceedings, causing him to miss a critical deadline. First, the respondent himself was present at the hearing where the Immigration Judge provided the date at issue (Tr. at 9-10). The heavy burden for prevailing on a motion to reopen cannot be shifted away from the respondent due to his failure to relate this information to his counsel of record. Next, the respondent made no effort to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), with respect to any ineffective assistance of counsel claim he intended to pursue. Finally, respondent’s counsel of record was on notice, due to the lapse of time, that some intervening court action might have occurred, but failed to investigate. Therefore, the respondent’s motion to reopen warrants denial, as he did not establish that new information affected the outcome of his case. Matter of Coelho, supra
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: FRANCISCO ISMAEL DIAZ-BISONO
File: AXXX XX7 740 - Atlanta, GA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sarah Owings, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joy Lampley
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a citizen of the Dominican Republic. On November 22, 2011, an Immigration Judge granted him the opportunity to depart the United States voluntarily by January 23, 2012, under safeguards. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on January 17, 2012. The Immigration Judge denied it on February 27, 2012, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). These proceedings fall within the REAL ID Act.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen. He disputes the Immigration Judge’s finding that he did not substantially comply with the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Dakane v. U.S. Atty.Gen., 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005).
 
Even assuming that the respondent satisfied the procedural requirements for his claim, he must also establish that his former counsel’s performance was deficient to the point that it impinged on the fundamental fairness of the hearing. See Ali v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 643 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir. 2011). It is required that he establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s alleged ineffectiveness. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
In the instant case, the respondent has not established that he was prima facie eligible for a grant of any form of relief from removal at his hearing other than voluntary departure. In fact, the respondent does not even address the issue with particularity in either his brief or the Notice of Appeal. Instead, the respondent’s contentions are limited to whether he satisfied the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. He has therefore not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s representation.
 
*2 We acknowledge that the respondent asserted in his motion to reopen that his former counsel’s inaction deprived him of the opportunity to be considered at the hearing for a “stand alone” waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(h) (See motion at 5). However, he is not eligible to be granted the waiver.
 
In Matter of Abosi and Matter of Sanchez, the Board found that an alien could apply for a “stand alone” 212(h) waiver, where the alien was a returning legal permanent resident seeking to overcome a ground of inadmissibility. However, an alien, like the respondent, who is within the United States and charged with deportability must submit an application for a 212(h) waiver concurrently with an application for a visa, admission, or adjustment of status. See section 212(h)(2) of the Act (a waiver of inadmissibility is permitted where the ““““Attorney General ... has consented to the alien’s applying or reapplying for a visa, for admission to the United States, or adjustment of status); 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(f) (“an application under this part shall be the sole method of requesting the exercise of discretion under sections 212(g), (h), (i), and (k) as they relate to the inadmissibility of an alien in the United States”).
 
The respondent is not an alien seeking admission into the United States and would not be applying for the waiver of inadmissibility in conjunction was an application for adjustment of status. In fact, the respondent acknowledges in his motion that he could not adjust his status to a lawful permanent resident of the United States in the foreseeable future because of his visa priority date. We do not find that the respondent established that he was denied a fair hearing warranting reopening of these proceedings. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Agnieszka Haupt, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Scot A. Bearup
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondents, both natives and citizens of Poland, appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 20, 2010, which denied their request for a continuance but granted voluntary departure under section 240B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c. The request for oral argument is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but we review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). Upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance. Although the respondents argue on appeal that there was good cause to grant a continuance based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel in visa petition proceedings, they have not filed, either before the Immigration Judge or the Board, any documents showing that they are pursuing the ineffective assistance claim or that such a claim is factually supported. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In any event, inasmuch as the alleged ineffective assistance relates to an employment-based visa petition, such matter is outside the scope of the Immigration Judge’s and the Board’s jurisdiction. See Matter of Hernandez-Puente, 20 I&N Dec. 335, 339 (BIA 1991); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(b), 1240.1(a)(1).
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge that any possible favorable change in immigration law is speculative. Moreover, to date, the respondents have not filed an application for relief or otherwise identified any relief from removal for which they may be eligible. Thus, the respondents have not shown that there was good cause for a continuance or that the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance resulted in actual prejudice. Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356 (BIA 1983); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. See Al-Ghorbani v. Holder, 585 F.3d 980, 992 (6th Cir. 2009). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondents are permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondents fail to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondents shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondents fail to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondents shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondents file a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondents file any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondents file a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se1
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margaret R. Kugel
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 Before us for decision is the respondent’s motion to reopen seeking an opportunity to apply for special rule cancellation of removal under section 203 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, Pub. L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2193, 2196, amended by Pub. L. No. 105-139, 111 Stat. 2644 (1997) (NACARA). The motion, which is opposed by the DHS, will be denied.
 
The instant motion (filed December 1, 2011), is untimely by more than 9 years. Section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); August 9, 2002, Board dec. (final administrative decision).2 There also has been no showing that at the late filing of this motion is excused. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i)-(iv).
 
In addition, we decline to reopen the respondent’s proceedings sua sponte, inasmuch as he has not demonstrated the existence of exceptional circumstances warranting such action. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999). Further, notwithstanding the currently-advanced assertions to the contrary, the respondent, a citizen of El Salvador, has not shown prima facie eligibility for special rule cancellation of removal.3 He entered the United States in March 1985, and therefore is an “ABC class member.” See American Baptist Churches, et al. v. Thornburgh, et al., 760 F. Supp. 796 (N.D. Cal. 1991) (ABC); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.60. However, there has been no additional evidentiary showing that he is a “registered ABC class member,” as defined in 8 C.F.R. § 1240.60 (requiring a person, such as the respondent, to have registered for ABC benefits with the former INS, or to have applied for Temporary Protected Status (TPS),4 on or before October 31, 1991). As such, he does not qualify as a section 203 NACARA principal applicant under 8 C.F.R. § 1240.61(a)(1). Further, the respondent has not established that he applied for asylum or before April 1, 1990, such that he qualifies as a principal applicant for such relief under 8 C.F.R. § 1240.61(a)(2).
 
*2 Insofar as it is also asserted that the respondent received ineffective assistance by his former attorney, this allegation has been advanced only by Mr. Chukwurah, not by the respondent himself. See Respondent’s Response to Government’s Opposition to Motion to Reopen at 2. Moreover, in moving to reopen the respondent has not submitted any evidence reflecting his compliance with the requirements for presenting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, as delineated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied. The request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal pending adjudication of the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied as moot.

Attorney Cyril O. Chukwurah (who filed the respondent’s Motion to Reopen, as well as his Response to Government’s Opposition to Motion to Reopen) has been suspended from practice before the Board, the Immigration Judges, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). As Mr. Chukwurah is not permitted to practice law before the Board at this time, today’s order is being sent directly to the respondent, with a copy being provided to Mr. Chukwurah. Please also see the attached copy of the order suspending Mr. Chukwurah from practice.

2

In light of this determination, we need not address the parties’ arguments as to whether this motion also is untimely pursuant to other provisions governing special motions to reopen for section 203 NACARA relief. See DHS Opposition to Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 5; Respondent’s Response to Government’s Opposition to Motion to Reopen.

3

It is now asserted that the respondent did not realize that NACARA relief was available to him, and that he did not have an opportunity to present his NACARA application, at his hearing. See Motion to Reopen at 3. However, the record establishes that the Immigration Judge questioned the respondent regarding his eligibility for such relief, and also discussed this issue with his attorney (Tr. at 5-7, 14). In his decision, the Immigration Judge noted that no proof of the respondent’s eligibility for section 203 NACARA relief was submitted. I.J. at 4.

4

It is also asserted that the respondent “was accorded TPS.” See Motion to Reopen at 2. No documentation has been provided confirming that the respondent has been granted TPS status. In any event, it has not been shown that he applied for TPS on or before October 31, 1991, to qualify as a “registered ABC class member,” and therefore as a principal applicant for special rule cancellation of removal under section 203 of the NACARA and 8 C.F.R. § 1240.61(a)(1). We separately note that if the respondent has been granted TPS, his order of removal cannot be executed until his TPS has expired. See generally Matter of Sosa-Ventura, 25 I&N Dec. 391, 396 (BIA 2010).

File: AXXX XX9 223 - San Antonio, TX
April 25, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
*1 This case was last before us on March 21, 2011, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s September 28, 2010, denial of his request for a continuance. The respondent has now filed an untimely motion to reopen proceedings on December 27, 2011. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel in his previous proceedings because his counsel before the Immigration Judge failed to timely apply for withholding of removal, failed to obtain a bond for the respondent, and failed to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision. He further argues that his attorney before the Board was not licensed as an attorney in the state of Texas, and also argues that she failed to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim during the appeal process. In support of his argument, the respondent has submitted an affidavit, a copy of the client agreement between himself and Ronald Higgins, Esquire, and evidence that he has filed complaints against both of his prior attorneys. The respondent has also filed evidence that he has pursued post-collateral relief regarding his conviction.
 
Notwithstanding this evidence, we do not find that the respondent has demonstrated prejudice as a result of his attorneys’ actions. See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent has not submitted evidence that he contracted with his first attorney to represent him on appeal, and inasmuch as this Board accepted the respondent’s untimely brief and considered his appeal on the merits, we do not find that he was prejudiced by any change in representation. Moreover, the respondent has not submitted an agreement with his prior appellate counsel.
 
Further, the respondent has failed to file an application for withholding of removal, as required by the regulations governing motions to reopen, nor has he set forth any kind of persecution claim. See § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by his first attorney’s failure to pursue withholding of removal on his behalf, or by his appellate attorney’s failure to raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The respondent has also not demonstrated how he was affected by his appellate attorney’s licensure in New York rather than Texas, and the respondent has submitted insufficient evidence regarding the nature of his representation during his bond proceedings. Lastly, we note that while the respondent has proffered documentation that he has filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with the United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, he has not submitted any indication that the Court changed the disposition of his conviction in alignment with Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003); see also Matter of Chavez, 24 I&N Dec. 272 (BIA 2007).
 
*2 Accordingly, we find no basis upon which to grant the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen proceedings based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See generally Matter of Lozada, supra; Matter of Assaad, supra. The motion will, thus, be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

The respondent asks that he be considered for “prosecutorial discretion” pursuant to the “Morton Memorandum” of November 17, 2011 (Motion at 3). He further contends that his attorney, Mr. Pollack, did not inform him of the Board’s adverse decision. However, the respondent has not complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), nor has he made any showing of prejudice, and reopening on this basis is not warranted. Rranci v. Att’y Gen., 540 F.3d 165, 172 (3d Cir. 2008) (outlining those requirements); Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 129 (3d Cir. 2001) (holding that “the Lozada requirements are a reasonable exercise of the Board’s discretion”).
 
The respondent further avers he is a “perfect candidate for prosecutorial discretion” as outlined in the “Morton Memorandum” (Motion at 3). However, this Board is not authorized to take action on such a request. Rather, a request for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion can be directed to the DHS. While the respondent also cites humanitarian factors in asking that proceedings be reopened, these factors do not constitute an exception to the statutory time limitation.
 
As the respondent has not demonstrated that his motion is exempt from the time limits on motions to reopen, neither reopening nor a stay of removal is warranted. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Danny C. Campbell, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)] - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Vietnam, has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated June 18, 2010. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s June 7, 2010, motion to reopen, determining that there is “no legal basis” upon which to reopen the proceedings (I.J.). We agree. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen for the reasons stated therein. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5) (2011). We write separately for two reasons. First, to the extent the respondent has accused her prior counsel of providing her with bad legal advice, she has not made an effective allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel; she has not complied with the standards for such claims set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir.1988). Finally, although the respondent has claimed that her removal will result in “extreme hardship,” she has not supported the motion to reopen with any application for relief from removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). Accordingly, the following order will be entered:

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven P. Barsamian, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Kenya. In a decision issued May 9, 2000, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia. The respondent filed a motion to reopen. She conceded that she had notice of the hearing, but averred that she was unable to travel due to illness. The Immigration Judge denied the motion because the respondent had not demonstrated exceptional circumstances. The respondent filed a Notice of Appeal, and on April 20, 2001, the Board dismissed the appeal.
 
Over 11 years later, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. She alleges that the time within which to reopen should be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance of counsel. She also seeks reopening under the Board’s sua sponte discretionary authority. The motion to reopen is denied as untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
The respondent has not satisfied the requirements of equitable tolling. She has not demonstrated substantial compliance with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741, 745-46 (4th Cir. 2006). Nor has the respondent demonstrated that she exercised due diligence in seeking reopening. See Chao v. Virginia Department of Transportation, 291 F.3d 276, 283 (4th Cir. 2002)(equitable tolling is not available when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf).
 
The limited evidence proffered with the motion, considered with the other evidence of record, does not demonstrate an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretion to reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey B. Rubin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on February 27, 2012, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s November 3, 2011, decision finding him removable as charged and ordering him removed from the United States. On March 15, 2012, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider and reopen with the Board alleging that his former counsel did not file an appellate brief on his behalf.1 The respondent also claims that his current counsel will file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea with the Lawrence District Court. The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a brief in opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.2
 
To the extent the motion is a motion to reconsider, it does not specify errors of fact or law in our former decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1) (stating that a motion to reconsider shall specify “errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.”); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). To the extent the motion is a motion to reopen, it is not supported with the requisite evidence. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (stating that a motion to reopen “shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.”). The respondent’s counsel’s statements in the brief are not evidence. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980); Matter of S-M-, 22 I&N Dec. 49, 51 (BIA 1998). Accordingly, the following order is entered.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Floyd J. Fernandez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; rescission
 
*1 On June 22, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind an order of removal entered in absentia on July 26, 2007. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The respondent claimed that she did not receive proper notice of her removal hearing. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). On April 29, 2011, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision, noting that the Notice to Appear (“NTA”) was sent to the respondent at the address she provided. On November 2, 2011, the respondent filed the instant untimely motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(i). The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent, who sought and continues to seek adjustment of status as the spouse of a United States citizen, raises ineffective assistance of counsel claims in the instant motion. Although she alleges that her former attorneys performed deficiently in both visa petition and removal proceedings, we emphasize that visa petition proceedings are separate and distinct from these removal proceedings. The dispositive issue now before the Board is whether ineffective assistance of counsel prevented the respondent from attending the scheduled removal hearing on July 26, 2007.
 
An alien may move to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal at any time if she did not receive proper notice. See section 240(c)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act. An alien may also move to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal within 180 days after date of the in absentia order if she establishes that the failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances. See section 240(c)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. The respondent now seeks to toll the filing deadline in light of her claim that she did not receive the NTA due to ineffective assistance of counsel.1 See Motion to Reopen at 3.
 
The respondent claims that her former attorney, Rateb Khasawneh, received a copy of the NTA in May 2006, and that he failed to notify her of the scheduled removal hearing. Id., at 6-7. She also alleges that Emmanuel Olawale, Esquire, the attorney who filed the motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge and the appeal before the Board, failed to raise the issue of Rateb Khasawneh’s alleged failure regarding the NTA. See Motion Exhibit A-2, at 2-3.
 
Initially, we find that the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel before this Board as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). See Pepaj v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 725, 727 (6th Cir. 2007) (“An alien who fails to comply with Lozada’s requirements forfeits her ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim”). We find no evidence of Rateb Khasawneh’s representation of the respondent in the record, and we find no evidence of the respondent’s compliance with Lozada’s requirements with regard to her claim of ineffective of counsel against him. With regard to her claim against Attorney Olawale, the respondent has not offered evidence that she filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities against Attorney Olawale in compliance with Lozada’s requirements. We further note that in his response to the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Attorney Olawale explains that he learned from the respondent after the dismissal of her appeal that Rateb Khasawneh had received a copy of the NTA. Attorney Olawale disputes the respondent’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 In sum, the respondent has not set forth viable claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Further, even if the respondent had complied with Lozada’s requirements, and even if she had shown (which she has not) that she suffered prejudice as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, equitable tolling is not appropriate because the respondent has not shown that she has acted with due diligence in bringing her ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the Board. See Barry v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 721, 724 (6th Cir. 2008). We note that in making her initial motion to reopen to rescind, no claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was made.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent concedes that she was no longer living at her address of record at the time the NTA was mailed to her. See Respondent’s Motion at 4-5. She specifically claims that she did not receive the NTA because she had moved. Id. Although she states that she notified the U.S. Postal Service that she had moved, the respondent has neither claimed nor provided evidence that she notified the Department of Homeland Security of her change of address.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Andrew Brown
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico who entered the United States without inspection by an immigration officer, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated January 10, 2012, ordering his removal from this country. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
It is undisputed that the respondent is subject to removal from the United States as a result of his manner of entry into this country (I.J. at 2-3; Exh. 1).1 See section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). As the respondent is subject to removal, it is his burden to establish eligibility for relief from removal. See section 240(c)(4)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). On appeal, the respondent does not allege that he is eligible for any form of relief from removal that can be granted by an Immigration Judge or this Board.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to enter an order of removal in this matter in lieu of further continuing proceedings. An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. An Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance will not be overturned unless the respondent establishes that the denial deprived him of his due process right to a full and fair hearing. See Matter of Luviano, 21 I&N Dec. 235, 237 (BIA 1996) (citing Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987)).
 
In this case, the respondent was personally served with a Notice to Appear on June 17, 2011 (Exh. 1). The respondent was granted continuances on July 21, 2011 (Tr. at 2), August 22, 2011 (Tr. at 4, 9-10), November 3, 2011 (Tr. at 12), November 29, 2011 (Tr. at 13), and January 3, 2012 (Tr. at 15). Additionally, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s written motion for a continuance in October 2011.
 
Despite having been afforded a significant amount of time to prepare for his removal proceedings, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should have further continued removal proceedings as he desires to apply for a U visa with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) under the provisions of section 101(a)(15)(U) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U), he had recently hired an unnamed “new attorney,” and that his prior counsel was ineffective. The respondent argues that his prior counsel provided ineffective assistance by not appearing at scheduled hearings and not properly presenting and pursuing his claim for a U visa.2
 
*2 USCIS has “sole jurisdiction” over all applications for U visa status and an alien who is subject to a final order of removal is not precluded from filing such an application. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1). Additionally, 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1)(ii) explicitly provides that, while the pendency of an application for a U visa has no effect on the Government’s authority to execute a removal order, an applicant for a U visa is permitted to file a request for a stay of removal with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). If USCIS approves the respondent’s application, he may file a motion to reopen and terminate removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(5)(i). Even if the respondent departs the United States, he may also pursue his application from abroad. 8 C.F.R. §214.14(c)(5)(i)(B). Considering the significant number of procedural safeguards which are in place in order to allow an alien a reasonable opportunity to pursue a U visa subsequent to an order of removal being entered against him, as well as the significant amount of time that was already provided to the respondent to pursue a U visa, we do not consider the speculative possibility that the respondent will be granted a U visa to be good cause to further continue these proceedings.3 See generally Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 110 (BIA 2009) (“As a practical matter, Immigration Judges and the Board have limited and finite adjudicative and administrative resources, and those resources are best allocated to matters over which we do have jurisdiction.”).
 
While the respondent claims that he had recently hired new counsel, he does not state the name of the representative that he allegedly hired, he has not presented any evidence to support such claims, and has not explained why these removal proceedings should have been continued in order for this unnamed attorney to enter an appearance. As discussed above, the respondent does not dispute that he is subject to removal from the United States and does not allege eligibility for any form of relief from removal that can be granted by an Immigration Judge or this Board. As such, the respondent’s claims concerning a “new attorney” do not establish that a further continuance was warranted. Such claims are also insufficient to establish that the unnamed attorney was ineffective.
 
To the extent that the respondent argues that his former counsel was ineffective, we observe that the respondent has not presented (1) an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with his former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) evidence that his former counsel has been informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) any indication as to whether a complaint against his former counsel has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*3 Additionally, the respondent’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel do not amount to a basis to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision as the respondent has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his counsel’s conduct. See Ali v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 643 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir. 2011). Given that the respondent does not dispute that he is subject to removal from the United States and does not allege eligibility for any form of relief that can be granted by an Immigration Judge or this Board, the respondent has not demonstrated that a reasonable probability that but for the counsel’s alleged errors, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. Even if an ineffective assistance claim could be premised on an counsel’s conduct regarding issues which are not directly related to removal proceedings, i.e., the pursuit of a U visa, the respondent has not demonstrated that an authorized official is willing to “certify” the respondent for the issuance of a U visa. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(2)(i). The former counsel’s assertions indicate that he made efforts to procure a certification from the state attorney’s office in Orange County, Florida and that the office was unresponsive (Tr. at 13, 16). The mere fact that the state attorney’s office has declined to issue a certification to the respondent does not established that the respondent’s counsel was ineffective. The respondent has not established that, even his former counsel’s assistance was free from the alleged defects, there is a reasonable probability that the state attorney’s office would have issued the requisite certification.
 
On appeal, the respondent has presented documents relating to his pursuit of the requisite certification needed for a U visa. The Board does not consider evidence first provided on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Additionally, we decline to remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge to consider the evidence in the first instance as such evidence has not been shown to affect the outcome of this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992). As discussed above, USCIS has sole jurisdiction to grant a U visa. Moreover, the evidence offered by the respondent does not demonstrate that an authorized official is willing to certify the respondent for U visa status. Accordingly, the evidence offer does not establish that the Immigration Judge’s decision to order the respondent removed to Mexico should be disturbed. The following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

As the respondent is subject to removal as a result of entering the United States without inspection by an immigration officer, we need not further address whether he is also subject to removal as a result of his criminal history.

The record reflects that the respondent’s former counsel did not timely appear at the removal hearing scheduled on August 22, 2011 (Tr. at 4). However, he appeared later that day (Tr. at 6). The respondent’s former counsel did not appear at the hearing on January 3, 2012 (Tr. at 15).

To date, the respondent has not presented any evidence that he has actually applied for a U visa.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margot Merrill-Johnson
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on March 25, 2002, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 17, 1999, decision ordering him removed from the United States to Nigeria. The respondent has now filed an untimely motion to reopen proceedings on January 13, 2012. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that we should reopen proceedings based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel that he received from the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Court and this Board. Specifically, the respondent argues, inter alia, that prior counsel (1) did not timely notify the respondent of the Board’s 2002 decision, (2) did not timely file an appeal to the Circuit Court, and (3) did not challenge the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent is removable as an aggravated felon.1
 
The respondent has provided no evidence in support of these allegations and claims, except for his own declaration, which neither identifies his prior counsel nor sets forth any agreement between himself and prior counsel. Thus, notwithstanding the respondent’s declaration, he has not complied with the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) in making claims against his former counsel. Matter of Lozada, supra, requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made.
 
While the respondent argues that his unidentified prior attorney failed to promptly notify him of the issuance of our decision or appeal its outcome, he has filed insufficient evidence for us to ascertain how this delay indicates that he suffered any prejudice on account of such allegations. See id. Lastly, the respondent has failed to show due diligence in making such claims against prior counsel, inasmuch as he has filed this motion over nearly 13 years after the Immigration Judge’s decision, and nearly a decade after our decision in the case. See id; Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). As such, we do not find that equitable tolling is warranted, nor do we find that the respondent warrants reopening under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See generally Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, we will deny the respondent’s motion as untimely.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.

The respondent’s appellate brief contained a legal argument disputing the respondent’s removability as an aggravated felon, and we addressed this issue in our 2002 decision (Bd. Dec. at 1-2). In our decision, we noted that the aggravated felony charges against the respondent had not been sustained by the Immigration Judge, and the DHS had not appealed from the Immigration Judge’s rulings in this regard.

On April 4, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings, which the Immigration Judge denied on April 21, 2011. The respondent filed a timely appeal of that decision. The appeal will be sustained, proceedings will be reopened and the record will be remanded.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen finding that she had received proper notice for her March 17, 2011, hearing. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied.
 
Upon review, we find that in view of the above and in light of the totality of circumstances presented in this case, including evidence reflecting that the respondent’s former counsel conceded that he provided ineffective assistance by failing to appear at the March 17, 2011, hearing, we will allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for a hearing. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008).
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James J. Orlow, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Paulette R. Taylor
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On October 24, 2011, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen. The respondent filed her second motion to reopen on November 23, 2011, which the Department of Homeland Security opposes. She submitted supplemental documentation on February 13, 2012. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is both time and number-barred as it is her second such motion, and was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s June 10, 2010, final administrative decision. Sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c), 1003.23(c). The respondent seeks reopening as she avers that former counsel, Ms. Clarke, provided her with ineffective assistance. Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). She also asks that proceedings be reopened sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
While the respondent has largely complied with the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, she did not demonstrate that she was prejudiced by Ms. Clarke’s actions. Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra at 1274 (holding that, “in addition to substantial, if not exact, compliance with ... Lozada, a petitioner ... must also show prejudice” in order to establish the ineffective assistance of counsel in the context of removal proceedings). “Prejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.” Id.
 
One of the reasons why the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s September 28, 2010, motion to reopen was that she failed to submit evidence regarding the bona fides of her marriage. The respondent has not shown that such evidence was available and could have been presented at that time. With her current motion the respondent submitted a sworn affidavit reporting that she met her husband in November of 2009, and that they were married on August 29, 2010. She provides no details regarding their courtship or relationship. However, the record reflects that the respondent sought a continuance on January 27, 2010, because she was then pregnant, and had moved to New York “where the father of her baby resides.” She stated that he was “supporting her emotionally and financially.” The motion for the continuance makes no mention of the respondent’s current husband, nor has he been identified as the father of the respondent’s baby. There is also no indication that the respondent’s husband ever resided in New York. Rather, it appears that he has always resided in Pennsylvania. Submissions from the respondent and her husband since the motion for a continuance do not mention either the baby, or the identity of the baby’s father.
 
*2 The respondent’s husband offered a statement dated December 9, 2010, more than a year after they reportedly met and more than three months after their marriage, indicating that they could not provide some documents in support of their marriage “due to incidents not cleared up yet” (Motion, Tab D). The evidence that was submitted included a November 2, 2010, life insurance policy naming the respondent as one of the beneficiaries; a December 9, 2010, form from a utility company indicating that the respondent had applied for service at a Pennsylvania address; a June 15, 2010, receipt for wedding rings from a Pennsylvania store; and photocopies of three wedding cards and a picture of the married couple (Motion, Tabs E-G).
 
As noted, the Immigration Judge denied reopening in part because of the respondent’s failure to submit evidence that her marriage was bona fide. With the 2010 motion, Ms. Clarke submitted a statement from the respondent, evidence that her husband had filed a visa petition on her behalf, and a copy of the marriage certificate. The only other evidence that apparently was available and could have been submitted in conjunction with the motion filed by Ms. Clarke would have been a letter from the respondent’s husband, and the photocopies of the cards and picture of the couple. There is no evidence that her husband’s letter would have been substantially different from the one submitted by the respondent. We find that, even if such evidence had been submitted, it would have been insufficient to establish the bona fides of the marital relationship. Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). As such, the respondent has not demonstrated that Ms. Clarke’s performance was so inadequate that there was a reasonable possibility that, but for her failure to submit the available evidence, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. Ali v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 643 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir. 2011). Therefore, reopening on this basis is not warranted.
 
Similarly, we decline to reopen proceedings sua sponte. The fact that the visa petition was approved on January 26, 2012, more than a year after the Immigration Judge denied her motion to reopen and more than three months after the Board upheld that decision, does not constitute an exceptional circumstance supporting reopening. Rather, the approval of a visa petition months after a respondent has been ordered removed is a not uncommon, rather than exceptional, circumstance. As such, we decline to exercise our discretionary authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (the Board’s sua sponte authority is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to circumvent the time limits where enforcing them might cause hardship); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
*3 As we find that reopening is not warranted, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: NORIKO KANAI A.K.A. NORIKO KANAI-POARCH
File: AXXX XX3 177 - Omaha, Nebraska

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Victor T. Nevada, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Clete P. Samson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a 39-year-old married female native and citizen of Japan, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s written decision dated November 11, 2010, which denied her motion to reopen her in absentia removal order. The respondent also filed an “amended” motion, and a motion to reconsider, which we will construe as constituting motions to remand. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a response on appeal. The motions will be denied. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2011). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues involving questions of law, judgement and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because she did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because she was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of her own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993).
 
Following a hearing conducted in absentia on September 28, 2004, when the respondent failed to appear, the Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal as charged, determined that she had abandoned all potential applications for relief, and ordered her removed from the United States. See generally section 240 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a.
 
In her motion to reopen filed on October 12, 2010, which was 6 years after she had been ordered removed, she alleged, through counsel Jacob Chang, that she had not received notice of her September 28, 2004, hearing.1 She also alleged that she had been instructed by her previous immigration attorney “of record” that it was not necessary for her to appear at the hearing.
 
*2 In a written decision issued on November 11, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied the motion because the notice of her hearing had been mailed to the respondent’s last known address as indicated in the Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien (Form I-213) in the record (Exh. 3). In addition, he noted that the respondent was not represented by counsel at the time the in absentia order was entered and therefore no attorney of record existed. Insofar as she had alleged that a prior attorney had committed ineffective assistance, the Immigration Judge found that the motion did not comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) because it did not reflect that she had filed a bar complaint. Finally, he noted that the motion did not contain an affidavit from the respondent.
 
On November 8, 2010, the respondent, through new attorneys, Maile M. Hirota and Victor T. Nevada, filed an “amended” motion to reopen with the Omaha Immigration Court.2 However, it was not received by the Chicago Immigration Court, where the Immigration Judge was located, until November 16, 2010, after he had issued his decision on the first motion. On November 29, 2010, she filed a motion to reconsider, which was not addressed by the Immigration Judge before the Notice of Appeal was filed with the Board on December 7, 2010. Therefore, we will construe both motions as constituting motions to remand before the Board.
 
In the November 8, 2010, motion, the respondent claimed that her original motion contained “material inaccuracies and omissions” because she had, in fact, received notice of the September 28, 2004, hearing. She therefore withdrew her claim of lack of notice. Instead, she maintained that she should be eligible for equitable tolling based on the alleged ineffective assistance of an attorney (Thomas Lee) she and her husband had retained to assist them in several matters, including her immigration case, and that his ineffective assistance constituted exceptional circumstances. The respondent’s November 29, 2010, motion requested that the Immigration Judge vacate his November 11, 2010, decision because her request to substitute counsel had been incorrectly rejected based on the absence of a pending case.
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that it was error for the Immigration Judge to deny her motion to reopen without having reviewed her “amended” motion to reopen, and that she has established exceptional circumstances and ineffective assistance of counsel to merit reopening of her in absentia removal order.
 
We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s October 12, 2010 motion. The Immigration Judge properly found that the respondent had received notice of the September 28, 2004, hearing and the respondent conceded that she received notice in her November 8, 2010, motion. In addition, the motion did not contain an affidavit as required, and it also did not establish any exceptional circumstances to excuse her failure to appear. Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, 509 (BIA 1996); Section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(l).
 
*3 Furthermore, the respondent has not set forth any valid reason to excuse her failure to comply with Matter of Lozada, supra, when she filed her October 12, 2010, motion to reopen she should have also made her ineffective assistance claim. See Matter of Medrano, 20 I&N Dec. 216 (BIA 1990) (arguments for consideration should be presented at one time, and not in “piecemeal fashion”).
 
We will deny the respondent’s November 8, 2010, motion because the respondent has not satisfied all of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, even at this time, because she has not provided a copy of the bar complaint she allegedly filed against Mr. Lee, and only has provided a copy of the bar complaint her husband filed against him for his representation in non-immigration matters. She also has not provided a copy of Mr. Lee’s response, if any, to her bar complaint, nor has she alleged that she has filed a bar complaint against Mr. Chang, who filed the first motion to reopen which contained factual inaccuracies.
 
To the extent that the respondent claimed that she was not aware of the allegations made by Mr. Chang in her October 12, 2010, motion, aliens “are generally bound by the conduct of their attorneys, including admissions made by them, absent egregious circumstances.” Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 934 (9th Cir. 1986). Furthermore, her contention that the Immigration Judge erred by issuing his decision without reviewing her November 8, 2010, motion is without merit because the Immigration Judge was not aware that she submitted a subsequent motion.
 
We also will deny the respondent’s November 29, 2010, motion regarding the rejection of her motion to substitute counsel by the Omaha Immigration Court administrative staff. The rejection represents at most a harmless clerical error, and the respondent has not demonstrated any prejudice because her new attorneys later filed two motions which were accepted. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s November 8, and November 29, 2010, motions to remand are denied.

Although Mr. Chang signed the motion on August 13, 2010, and attached a receipt from the Los Angeles, California DHS office which reflected that he paid the $ 110 filing fee on August 13, 2010, it is date stamped by the Omaha Immigration Court as having been received on October 12, 2010.

2

On November 3, 2010, the respondent filed a motion for substitution of counsel to replace Mr. Chang with Maile M. Hirota and Victor T. Nevada. However, the Omaha Immigration Court administrative staff sent a preprinted form notice on November 4, 2010, to Mr. Chang which erroneously rejected the filing because the Immigration Court records did not indicate that the respondent’s case was pending before the Immigration Court.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)] - Crime involving moral turpitude
 
Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The appeal is dismissed. The Immigration Judge’s order, dated July 8, 2010, reflects that the respondent had waived appeal, and the transcript of proceedings also indicates that the respondent, through his attorney, waived appeal (Tr. at 12). On July 22, 2010, the respondent nevertheless filed a Notice of Appeal.
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(2)(G), 1003.39. The respondent makes no claim that the appeal waiver was invalid.
 
To the extent that the respondent claims ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not complied with any of the requirements for making such a claim, as described in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 498 (5th Cir. 2000) (upholding the Lozada requirements). These requirements include filing an affidavit describing the scope of the representation agreement, notifying the prior attorney of the allegations, and lodging a complaint against the attorney with the proper disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639.1
 
Therefore, we find that this case is not properly before us, and the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied, the appeal is dismissed, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without any further Board action.

The respondent also claims that the lack of translation during the hearing left him “confused”; however, he was represented by counsel. Also, as a longtime resident of the United States who wrote his Notice of Appeal and extension request in English, there is no evidence that he was hampered in understanding the proceedings.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on June 18, 2001, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order that was entered on October 4, 2000. On May 20, 2011, the respondent filed a new motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal based on a deficiency with the Notice to Appear (“NTA”) and ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion is properly filed with the Board, since we entered the last order in these proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent urges that the NTA should be deemed invalid because it did not specify the date and time of her initial hearing (Motion at 4). We note that the NTA indicates both the date and time are “to be determined” (Exh. 1). Pursuant to the applicable regulation, the date and time of an initial removal hearing shall be provided in the NTA “where practicable,” and if the date and time are not set when the NTA is issued, the Immigration Court shall be responsible for scheduling the hearing and providing notice regarding the date, place, and time of the initial hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.18(b). Accordingly, here, in compliance with these regulations and the Act the Immigration Court sent the respondent’s initial notice of hearing to the address of the detention center where she was currently residing.1 See section 239(a)(2)(A), (c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(2)(A), (c) (permitting service by mail of the time and place of any hearing before the Immigration Court and finding attempted service at the alien’s last address provided in accordance with section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act to be sufficient).
 
In the alternative, the respondent urges that the numerical limitations on motions to reopen and rescind an in absentia order should be equitably tolled because she is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and 240(c)(7)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) & (c)(7)(A) (setting forth time and number limits on motions to reopen and rescind in absentia orders of removal); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3) & 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (same); see also Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154, 159 (2d Cir. 2006) (finding that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim may warrant equitable tolling of both the time and number limits).
 
*2 First, the respondent has not complied with any of the Lozada2 procedural requirements. See Jiang v. Mukasey, 522 F.3d 266, 270 (2d Cir. 2008) (stating that a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel must comply with the Lozada requirements). Second, the respondent has not demonstrated that she acted with due diligence in pursuing her claim prior to filing the instant motion on May 20, 2011, almost 10 years after the Board’s prior decision. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 130-32 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding that, in order to warrant equitable tolling, an alien is required to demonstrate “due diligence” in pursuing his claims during “both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed”). Third, the respondent has not demonstrated that she was prejudiced by her prior counsels actions or inactions. See Jiang v. Mukasey, supra, at 270 (stating that to succeed on a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance an applicant must show, inter alia, “that the applicant was prejudiced by his counsel’s performance.”). Here, the respondent seeks to apply for political asylum. However, she has not articulated a basis for her claim nor has she submitted an asylum application or any evidence to establish her prima facie eligibility for relief. Thus, the motion to reopen is untimely, and the respondent has not shown due diligence or prejudice to warrant equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Finally, although not explicitly requested, the respondent has not shown that an “exceptional situation” exists that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent was initially placed in removal proceedings with the Immigration Court in Miami, Florida. She was then released from former INS custody and filed a motion to change venue to the Immigration Court in New York, New York (see I.J. Decision dated October 4, 2000; Exh. 2).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sarosh Nawaz Wahla
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
 
*1 In a decision dated November 29, 2011, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for voluntary departure and ordered him removed to Mexico. The respondent filed a timely appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, under a clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge weighed the positive and negative equities. See Matter of Lemhammad, 20 I&N Dec. 316 (BIA 1991). We have considered the respondent’s arguments and find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact. Upon de novo review of whether those facts support the conclusion that the respondent failed to meet his burden of proof to establish that he merits relief as a matter of discretion, we reach the same conclusion as the Immigration Judge. The respondent essentially argues on appeal that the two controlled substances crimes discussed by the Immigration Judge, as well as a misdemeanor driving under the influence offense that the Immigration Judge did not discuss, are insufficient for a negative finding. The respondent also discusses the length of time he has spent in the United States and the economic difficulties he would face in Mexico. While we acknowledge that the respondent has presented some positive equities, we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the respondent does not merit a grant of voluntary departure.
 
The respondent states that the Immigration Judge should have continued the case until his attorney made an appearance, but he does not state that he requested a continuance, and does not describe what, if any, efforts he made to have an attorney represent him. The transcript reflects that the respondent was able to communicate with the Immigration Judge and there was no apparent reason to continue the case based on the respondent’s inability to proceed pro se. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29 (continuance may be granted for good cause shown). Thus, contrary to the respondent’s appellate claims regarding due process and the right to counsel, we find no constitutional violation. To the extent that the respondent’s appellate argument may be construed as a complaint about the performance of his counsel, he has not filed a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and on the record before us we see no justification for sustaining the appeal on this basis. See, e.g. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).

File: AXXX XX5 070 - Newark, NJ

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se1
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Patricia M. Medeiros
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 In an oral decision dated November 14, 2011, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for a continuance; found him removable; determined that he did not demonstrate eligibility for any relief from removal; and ordered him removed from the United States to Trinidad and Tobago.2 The respondent appealed from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent was found removable as charged, as in the United States in violation of law pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B). Upon our de novo review, we find correct the Immigration Judge’s conclusions concerning the respondent’s removability and ineligibility for removal relief.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should have granted him an additional continuance of his removal hearings to await the adjudication by the criminal court of pending charges for criminal possession of stolen property and assault. At his removal hearings, the respondent indicated that, if the criminal charges were dismissed and he were released from custody, he would marry his United States citizen fiancee, who would file an immediate relative visa petition on his behalf. In addition, his lawful permanent resident mother had filed a second preference visa petition for him on November 4, 2011. If a visa petition for him were approved, he would seek adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255. He stated that he was not seeking any other relief from removal. See Tr. at 4. He was represented by immigration counsel throughout his hearings. With his appeal, he has provided documentation from the criminal court reflecting that the assault charge was dismissed without prejudice on December 20, 2011, and that the criminal possession of stolen property charge is to be dismissed and sealed on March 1, 2012.
 
The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, and good cause must be shown for a continuance. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1997); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. In this case, the Immigration Judge afforded the respondent two previous continuances, from September 27, 2011, until October 31, 2011; and from October 31, 2011, until November 14, 2011. As of the November 2011 final hearing, no visa petition had been approved for the respondent. The preference petition filed for him by his mother in November 2011 remained pending. He and his citizen fiancee had not married and, consequently, she had not even filed a spousal petition for him. In the absence of an approved visa petition, the respondent did not demonstrate eligibility for adjustment of status, consistent with the Immigration Judge’s determinations.3 Given the lack of an approved visa petition, the respondent is ineligible for adjustment of status, even if both of his criminal charges have been dismissed by the criminal court. Cf. Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009) (holding that, if the respondent presents a prima facie approvable visa petition and an adjustment application, a rebuttable presumption arises that the continuance should be granted and that, in considering a continuance request, four factors to be evaluated are: 1) the position of the DHS regarding the continuance request; 2) whether the visa petition is prima facie approvable; 3) whether the respondent is statutorily eligible for the requested relief; and 4) whether discretion should be exercised in the respondent’s favor). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination not to allow a third continuance.
 
*2 Next, the respondent contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorney who represented him at his removal hearings. However, the respondent has failed to offer any evidence that substantially complies with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and he further has failed to demonstrate that he suffered the requisite prejudice from counsel’s alleged action or inaction such that a remand for consideration of his claim would be warranted, based on his cursory and unsupported appellate allegations. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). The respondent has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for adjustment or removal relief, either before the Immigration Judge or on appeal. To the extent that the respondent contends that his removal proceedings were unfair, we find that he has not demonstrated any error by the Immigration Judge in handling his hearings, under the circumstances of this case. We also find that he has not demonstrated any resultant prejudice such as would amount to a due process violation. See Romanishyn v. Attorney General of U.S., 455 F.3d 175 (3d Cir. 2006).
 
Finally, the respondent has requested a remand. See Br. at 5. We do not find that a remand is warranted for any reason in this case, and we deny the remand request.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.4

The record contains documentation from attorney Barry Schneps verifying that he was released from representation by the respondent. Thus, the respondent is pro se.

2

The proceedings before the Immigration Judge in this matter were completed in Newark, New Jersey through video conference pursuant to section 240(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(2)(A)(iii).

3

The Immigration Judge also correctly observed that, even if the preference visa petition filed by his mother in November 2011 were to be approved, the respondent still could not demonstrate eligibility for adjustment of status, as the priority date is not current for such visa petition. See Department of State Visa Bulletin, Vol. IX, No. 42 (March 2012) (reflecting relevant current priority dates for family second preference petitions of November 15, 2003, and earlier). Thus, he would not have an immigrant visa immediately available to him, as required by section 245(a)(3) of the Act.

We note that the transcript contains numerous “indiscernibles.” However, we have been able to fully review the record, and neither party has raised the issue.

IN RE: WALTER ORLANDO CHIVICHON-HERNANDEZ A.K.A. WALTER CHIVICHON
File: AXXX XX1 448 - Imperial, CA
February 27, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Julie R. Sparks, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
W.P. Hollerich
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of Guatemala, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on February 4, 2009, after failing to appear at a hearing. He was thereafter removed from this country, returned, and filed a motion to reopen on November 14, 2011. The Immigration Judge denied it on November 21, 2011, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent does not argue in his Notice of Appeal that his failure to appear at his hearing was caused by either “exceptional circumstances” or lack of notice. He states therein that he was eligible to apply for a U visa at the time of his hearing, and he was denied the opportunity.
 
The regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) provides that “except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings (whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge) and that motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later.” The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed nearly 2 years after the Immigration Judge ordered his removal from the United States. It is therefore untimely.
 
In addition, in Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008), the Board held that it lacked authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) to reopen removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings-whether on motion of an alien or sua sponte-if the alien has departed the United States after those administrative proceedings have been completed. The only exceptions involve timely motions to reopen a removal order or alleging lack of notice as the reason for a failure to appear. See Martinez Coyt v. Holder, 593 F.3d 902 (9th Cir. 2010); Matter of Bulnes, 25 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 2009). Neither situation is applicable herein.
 
*2 We further would not reopen these proceedings sua sponte even if we had such authority. We do not find that the respondent established the existence of an exceptional situation to warrant doing so. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We also note no evidence that the respondent was denied due process by the Immigration Judge presiding at his hearing or satisfied any of the procedural requirements for establishing that he is a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Bongseob Moon, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lincoln Jalelian
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondents, natives and citizens of South Korea, have appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 29, 2009. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) seeks summary affirmance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
Suspension of deportation under section 244(a) of the Act maybe available to certain aliens in deportation proceedings. However, the respondents here are in removal proceedings. Removal proceedings replaced deportation proceedings in immigration cases commencing on or after April 1, 1997. See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (enacted Sept. 30, 1996) (IIRIRA). In addition, §§ 304(a)(3) and 308(a)(7) of the IIRIRA, 110 Stat. at 3009-594, 3009-615, specifically repealed section 244(a) of the Act in all cases commencing on or after April 1, 1997, and provided a new form of relief - cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) - for aliens in removal proceedings. The Notice to Appear (Form I-862) was served on the respondents on March 5, 2009, and filed with the Immigration Court on March 13, 2009. Thus, the respondents cannot apply for suspension of deportation under section 244(a) of the Act because that provision no longer existed for aliens, such as the respondents, who are in removal proceedings. See Arenas-Yepes v. Gonzales, 421 F.3d 111, 116-17 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that because petitioner’s proceedings commenced after the enactment of IIRIRA, alien was statutorily ineligible for suspension of deportation). Moreover, they are statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act because they have not shown that they have a qualifying family member (Tr. at 12-14). See section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act. Nor did they seek this form of relief. See Pleadings, dated September 23, 2009. Subsequent dissatisfaction with a strategic decision of counsel is not grounds for reopening. Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998).
 
The respondents on appeal maintain that the Immigration Judge failed to consider that they “were defrauded by an immigration broker.” Notice of Appeal Addendum. The record does not reveal that this issue was raised before the Immigration Judge. In addition, we note that they have not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46 (2d Cir. 2005); Matter of Asaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 Finally, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondents failed to show any due process denial because they were not provided the list of free legal services with the Notice to Appear (I.J. at 1-3). The record reflects that the list was provided to the respondents at their first hearing on April 14, 2009 (Tr. at 3). Moreover, they have not established any prejudice, given that they were provided two continuances to obtain counsel (Tr. at 4, 7) and had representation at their final hearing of September 29, 2009 (Tr. at 9). See Monter v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 546 (2d Cir. 2005)(to demonstrate “prejudice,” of kind required to entitle alien to remand based on immigration judge’s erroneous decision of motion for change of venue, alien must show that denial of venue change affected either the outcome or overall fairness of proceeding).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Harlan E. Schackner, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Patricia M. Medeiros
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was before the Board on December 18, 2009, when we issued our order denying the respondent’s motion for remand to seek adjustment of status, and dismissing her appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 20, 2008, denial of her motion for a continuance. On April 19, 2011, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen these removal proceedings to pursue adjustment of status. The motion is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (90-day time limit for motion to reopen); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (same). The respondent asserts that the filing deadline has been tolled in her case due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security has filed a memorandum opposing the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The Board’s previous order denied the respondent’s motion to remand and dismissed her appeal for lack of jurisdiction. See Board Order, 12/18/2009 at 2. The respondent is an arriving alien. See Exh. 1A. The Board based its decision in her case on Matter of Silitonga, 25 I&N Dec. 89 (BIA 2009), holding that Immigration Judges have no jurisdiction to adjudicate an application of an arriving alien for adjustment of status, with an exception that we determined to be inapplicable based on the record here. The instant motion fails to address the matter of jurisdiction.
 
Assuming, however, that for purpose of this motion the Board should exercise jurisdiction, the respondent fails to make a persuasive argument that she is entitled to equitable tolling of the filing deadline on account of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board held in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), that due process rights may be violated when ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from reasonably presenting her case, but the alien must show that she was prejudiced by counsel’s performance by demonstrating eligibility for relief, and must meet procedural requirements, including a detailed statement of the agreement entered into with former counsel, notice to former counsel and the opportunity to respond, and a complaint filed with disciplinary authorities. The instant motion includes very brief complaints filed with New York disciplinary authorities against four attorneys on April 8, 2011 (days before filing of the motion). See Motion to Reopen (untabbed exhibits). These complaints lack detail as called for by the complaint form itself as well as Lozada, and do not include any supporting documentation. The Board concludes that the respondent has not demonstrated substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements. Further, the complaints and the instant motion were brought 16 months after the Board’s last order in the case, a delay that indicates lack of due diligence. See Mahmood v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 248, 252-53 (3rd Cir. 2005) (whether alien exercised due diligence is ordinarily a fact question, but 13-month delay in moving to reopen was conclusive so as to deny equitable tolling, despite alien’s difficulty in “navigating the shoals of American law” (citation omitted)). We conclude that the filing deadline for a motion to reopen has not been tolled in this case.
 
*2 Finally, the Board concludes that the instant motion does not indicate any exceptional situation for the Board to grant her request to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (the Board’s sua sponte authority is an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations, and is not a general remedy for hardships created by enforcement of the time limit in the regulations).
 
Accordingly, the motion will be denied as untimely filed.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and motion for a stay are denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rosaura Gonzalez Rucci, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Magdalena Ramos Romey
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 3, 2010. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be returned to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under a clearly erroneous standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629, 637 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge instructed the respondent to file his application for relief from removal in the form of adjustment of status by April 29, 2010. The respondent failed to comply with the filing deadline and he moved, through counsel, for a continuance and an extension of the filing deadline. Counsel indicated that she had been waiting for the respondent to supply a sponsorship affidavit in support of the application and simply “overlooked” the filing deadline. The Immigration Judge, in a decision date May 4, 2010, denied the motion indicating that insufficient reasons for failure to comply with the filing deadline were presented and declared the application for adjustment abandoned. The respondent filed a motion to reopen together with supporting documentation and a statement from counsel attributing the failure to file the application to her deficient performance. On May 17, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied reopening citing the respondent’s failure to submit an adjustment application with the motion, and incorporating the rationale of her May 4, 2010, decision. The Immigration Judge did not address counsel’s admission of ineffective assistance.
 
Upon our de novo review, we will reverse the decision of the Immigration Judge. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate sufficient reason for failing to file the respondent’s adjustment application. However, the respondent has also presented a plain instance of ineffective assistance of counsel that resulted in substantial prejudice, and we find that reopening is warranted on that basis. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Inasmuch as counsel conceded responsibility for missing the filing deadline, we do not find that strict compliance with the procedural requirements for claims of ineffective assistance set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), is necessary. Compare Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998) (declining to consider a claim of ineffective assistance in the absence of Lozada compliance when there was no showing of egregious conduct on the part of counsel). The record will be returned to the Immigration Court to provide the respondent with a further opportunity to seek relief from removal.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN RE: MILAGRO GERVACIO-PIMENTEL
File: AXXX XX8 078 - Guaynabo, PR

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Luis A. Defillo-Rosas, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ronald B. Seely
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on September 29, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On October 24, 2011, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider and reopen urging that she received ineffective assistance of counsel and that proceedings should be reopened for reconsideration of her application for adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a brief in opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider shall specify “errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b) (providing that a motion to reconsider shall specify “errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority”); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). The respondent’s motion does not establish any error in our previous decision concluding that she is statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). Moreover, the respondent does not argue that there was any error in the Board’s prior decision, but rather, requests that we reconsider our decision in light of the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion does not provide any basis to conclude error in the Board’s ultimate decision; therefore, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
The motion is also in the nature of a motion to reopen. Applicable regulations provide that a motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, a movant must satisfy the “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must show that competent counsel would have acted otherwise and that the alien was prejudiced. See Saakin v. INS, 252 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2001); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent urges that the attorney who represented her at her hearing below and on appeal before the Board was ineffective because he failed to request nunc pro tunc an I-212 waiver for permission to reapply for admission into the United States after removal (Motion at 2). First, we note that the respondent was found to be inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I), for being in the United States for an aggregate period of more than 1 year and then re-entering the United States without being admitted.1 There is no waiver of inadmissibility available for section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act. Matter of Briones, 24 I&N Dec. 355 (BIA 2007). To the extent that the respondent is arguing that a nunc pro tunc waiver of inadmissibility for illegal entry and status violations exists, we explained in Matter of Torres-Garcia, 23 I&N Dec. 866, 877 (BIA 2006), that the waiver available at 8 C.F.R. § 212.2 does not relate to the grounds of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(C) of the Act. As the respondent remains ineligible for adjustment of status, she has not demonstrated prejudice from counsel’s actions or omissions such that she has established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Finally, while the respondent requests sua sponte reopening, her motion does not demonstrate an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretionary authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “the power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent mistakenly asserts in the current motion that she was found inadmissible for being ordered removed and then re-entering the United States without being admitted, which would make her inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(II) of the Act.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: EUGENE EUSTACE MAKUPA
File: AXXX XX8 702 - Kansas City, MO
January 25, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew L. Hoppock, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jennifer A. May
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Tanzania, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 23, 2010, granting him voluntary departure and noting both the respondent and the Department of Homeland Security had waived their right to appeal.1 The appeal will be considered and dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether or not the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should have granted him a continuance to await the outcome of a visa petition filed on his behalf, that he was ineffectively served by previous counsel, and that he did not knowingly waive his appeal rights. As it is not clear from the record that the respondent was properly advised of his right to appeal, we will consider the current appeal.
 
The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent a further continuance, as the respondent did not make a persuasive showing of good cause for the request. An Immigration Judge is not obligated to suspend properly instituted removal proceedings indefinitely so that an alien can attempt to establish eligibility for relief, particularly in a case such as this where the outcome is speculative. The respondent blames his previous attorney for the length of these proceedings (Resp. Br. at 8). However, it is clear from the record that the respondent has failed to appear on several occasions before the Immigration Judge. Two orders of removal have been entered in absentia and his attorney appeared without the respondent at one time. Further the respondent appears to have missed interviews concerning the visa petitions. Tr. at 5, 8-10, 18-19, 35-36. In any event, despite his claim on appeal that the outcome of the visa petitions was not known, there was agreement below that the first two visa petitions filed on his behalf were denied (Tr. at 13, 35-36, 41-46). He argues that his previous attorney lost the evidence of a third filing, but the record still contains no documentary evidence that this petition was filed or approved. Upon de novo review, we conclude the Immigration Judge did not err in denying what would have been, at least, the respondent’s seventh continuance request concerning the visa petition. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). We also note that nearly 2 years have elapsed since the Immigration Judge entered his decision in this case and we have received no indication that the respondent’s latest visa petition has been approved.
 
*2 Further, the respondent has failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel which would warrant a remand of the record. The respondent has complied with many of the requirements set out in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d (6th Cir. 2006); Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). However, even assuming that the respondent has established that his former counsel was ineffective, he has failed to show any prejudice from the actions of his prior counsel. See id; Hamid v.Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 465 (6th Cir. 2003). That is, he has not shown that the outcome of his case may have been different absent the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Ortiz-Puentes v. Holder, 662 F.3d 481 (8th Cir. 2011) (respondent needs to show reasonable probability that, but for the alleged errors by counsel, the result of the case would be different), citing, Obleshchenko v. Ashcroft, 392 F.3d 970, 972 (8th Cir.2004) (same). The respondent conceded he was removable as charged and has not demonstrated eligibility for any relief from removal. See Matter of Almanza, 24 I&N Dec. 771 (BIA 2009) (burden on respondent to demonstrate eligibility for relief). The respondent’s charges of ineffective assistance of counsel do not undermine the Immigration Judge’s determination of removability and the respondent’s ineligibility for adjustment of status. The respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, therefore, fails.
 
As the Immigration Judge properly denied the continuance request and the respondent has not demonstrated any prejudice from the actions of previous counsel, the appeal will be dismissed. As we have accepted the respondent’s appeal, we will reinstate voluntary departure for a period of 60 days. We caution the respondent, however, of the severe consequences of failing to depart the United States pursuant to a grant of this relief.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
*3 NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d)of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

IN RE: DONOVAN FRITZ BONNER

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joan M. Powers, Esquire1
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brandon J. Josephsen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred and will be denied. The Board entered the final administrative order in this case on May 8, 2001, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order entered on June 12, 2000. A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision and only one may be filed. Sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The current motion was filed more than 10 years after the Board’s decision. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion.
 
The respondent seeks to reopen these proceedings to pursue adjustment of status. However, a motion to reopen to seek adjustment of status does not fall within any of the statutory or regulatory exceptions to the motions time and number limits. Sections 240(c)(7)(C)(ii)-(iv) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3).
 
Additionally, the respondent has not set forth “exceptional circumstances” that would warrant the exercise of our sua sponte authority to reopen. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). Notably, the respondent’s potential eligibility for adjustment of status did not arise until his mother became a naturalized United States citizen on August 3, 2001, nearly 3 years after these proceedings commenced. Additionally, the visa petition (Form I-130) filed on the respondent’s behalf was not approved until March 19, 2007 nearly 6 years after the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. Becoming potentially eligible for relief, such as adjustment of status, after a final administrative order has been entered is common and does not, in itself, constitute an exceptional circumstance warranting consideration of an untimely motion to reopen.
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent may be alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel, the claim has not been meaningfully raised, where the respondent has not shown compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Nor has the respondent shown due diligence or prejudice, where he has waited more than 10 years to assert the claim, and has not demonstrated how previous counsel’s alleged deficient performance prejudiced the respondent’s case. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005) (concluding that an alien must show prejudice when he advances an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and that “[p]rejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different”); Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998) (alien must show that “the conduct of former counsel was so egregious that it rendered [the] hearing unfair”). We also note that the respondent’s discussion of new guidelines for prosecutorial discretion does not warrant reopening, as the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is a matter for the DHS rather than the Board.2 See Respondent’s Response in Support of the Motion at 4.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul A. Suhr, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa P. Durant
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on August 11, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against him og March 25, 2010. On September 30, 2011, the respondent filed the pending motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, to the extent the respondent could be construed as a motion to reconsider, the motion is untimely filed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Moreover, the respondent has not identified any error in the Board’s August 11, 2011, decision that found in part that he had received legal notice of the March 25, 2010, removal hearing. The respondent acknowledged that he had been personally served with the Notice of Appear and that he had received that initial Notice of Hearing, both of which documents warned him of his duty to notify the Immigration Court of any change of address within 5 days of the change, and that he did not file a notice of his change of address with the Immigration Court after he moved to New York.
 
Turning to his request for reopening, the pending motion is untimely filed and number barred and has not been shown to qualify for any exception to the filing requirements imposed on motions to reopen removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); see also Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000). The respondent’s present motion urges that both of his prior attorneys failed to effectively represent him. However, the respondent’s motion fails to comply with the procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Moreover, and separately, the motion fails to adequately demonstrate prejudice as the respondent’s failure to timely advise the Immigration Court of his change of address occurred months before he first consulted with counsel.
 
On this record, the respondent has not provided us with an adequate basis to excuse the fact that his motion is both untimely and number barred. Nor has he demonstrated any exceptional circumstance that would warrant the reopening of these proceedings under the Board’s discretionary sua sponte authority. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
M. Omar Chaudhry, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ted Y. Yamada
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In a December 29, 2010, decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia removal order entered on March 10, 2010. The respondent has appealed this decision. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has requested that the Immigration Judge’s decision be affirmed. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met their relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
It is undisputed that the respondent was personally and properly served with notice of his March 10, 2010, hearing. It is also undisputed that the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order that was based on a claim of exceptional circumstances was filed on October 25, 2010, more than 180 days after the March 10, 2010, removal order was issued against him and was therefore untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia order of removal issued on March 10, 2010. There is a discrepancy in the record between the respondent’s claim in his affidavit that he relied on the advice of an individual whom he identified only as “Michael” and filings made on his behalf, which includes an asylum application and motions to change venue, that showed they were filed with the assistance of an attorney named Victor D. Ocampo (“Ocampo”). Neither the respondent’s affidavit nor the motion made any attempt to resolve this discrepancy. We note, moreover, that we cannot be confident of the accuracy and reliability of the respondent’s affidavit, as it misstated the date of his hearing in many of his key averments (see “Affidavit in Support,” ¶¶ 8,11,12). Based on this record, we agree with the Immigration Judge’ s ultimate determination that the affidavit the respondent submitted with his motion did not establish that exceptional circumstances caused his failure to appear for his hearing, or that the 180-day deadline for the motion should be equitably tolled. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
To the extent that the respondent on appeal has advanced new allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel against attorney Ocampo, we cannot consider such claims for the first time on appeal, and the respondent did not otherwise file or satisfied the requirements of a motion to remand (Respondent’s Br. at 5). See Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 261 n.1 (BIA 2007); Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191, 197 n.4 (BIA 1990); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992). Contrary to the respondent’s argument, moreover, we cannot conclude that the respondent established that ineffective assistance of counsel was obvious on the face of the record, which included the respondent’s inconsistent affidavit, such that may have excused the respondent from complying with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Tamang v. Holder, 598 F.3d 1083 (9th Cir. 2010); see also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525-26 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that failure to comply with the Lozada requirements is not fatal where the alleged ineffective assistance is plain on the face of the record). In view of the foregoing, the following order shall be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX8 365 - Los Angeles, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicklaus Misiti, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before us on March 14, 2003, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s order of removal. The respondent’s motion, filed over 8 years later on November 2, 2011, is not timely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent argues the time limits for motions should be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance by prior counsel. The untimeliness of an alien’s motion may be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance of counsel where the alien can show diligence, prejudice resulting from the attorney’s ineffective assistance, and compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir. 2003) (a petitioner may obtain equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel as long as he “act[ed] with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error”). See also Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672 (9th Cir. 2011) (setting forth requirements for due diligence).
 
The respondent has not established due diligence. The respondent argues that she received ineffective assistance in 1999 when her attorney did not tell her to attend an interview for an I-130 petition; that her attorney should have informed the respondent of her disbarment so she could have had representation at her hearing on March 2, 2001; that a second attorney hired to file her appeal ceased returning her phone calls; and that another firm she hired on April 11, 2003, “took no action and she was forced to sue them to get her money back”1 (Motion at 4).
 
The respondent knew of the purported ineffective assistance of these attorneys as early as 1999, 2001, and 2003, respectively. Her motion does not reflect that she took any action after 2003 until the filing of the present motion. A letter from the New York Legal Assistance Group reflects that she contacted them in March 2007, for “assistance with applying for her green card” and she contacted them again on October 22, 2010 “for assistance with another immigration matter” (Motion, Exhibit I). This is insufficient to demonstrate due diligence in pursuing this case. Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2007).
 
As the respondent has not shown due diligence, she has not established that equitable tolling of the time limits is warranted. The regulatory time limits will be applied to this motion.
 
*2 The respondent also requests sua sponte reopening. We do have the discretionary authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings in limited, “exceptional” situations. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We have examined the respondent’s allegations in this case, including the hardship her family would suffer upon her removal. However, we find no exceptional situation in this case such that sua sponte reopening would be warranted.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN RE: ANGEL ORTIZ-HERNANDEZ
File: AXXX XX1 433 - Memphis, TN

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jamie B. Naini, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Scot A. Bearup
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, timely appeals a July 26, 2011, decision by the Immigration Judge denying reopening of his February 23, 2011, decision which granted voluntary departure with an alternate order of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) opposes the appeal. The respondent filed a request for stay of removal which was denied by the Board on September 15, 2011. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s June 2011 motion to reopen was untimely and that the respondent has not presented an exception to the filing deadline under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4) (I.J. at 2). We agree that the respondent did not present any argument or submit any evidence regarding changed country conditions in Mexico (I.J. at 3). On appeal, the respondent refers to the application for asylum he filed with his motion to reopen, and his claim that he would be in danger if returned to Mexico (Resp. Br. at 13-14). However, he did not allege that there had been changed country conditions from the time he accepted voluntary departure and when he filed his motion to reopen.
 
He also contends ineffective assistance of counsel against his prior counsel who represented him before the Immigration Judge for not advising him of the forms of relief available to him (Resp. Br. at 5; Motion at 3). However, we agree that he has not complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10(1st Cir. 1988) (I.J. at 3-4). He has not submitted evidence that his former counsel was contacted regarding the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel and he has not filed a complaint regarding his former counsel’s performance with the appropriate disciplinary authorities.
 
The respondent was granted voluntary departure under section 240B(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(1), which requires the respondent to expressly waive his right to appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D); see also Matter of Ocampo, 22 I&N Dec. 1301, 1304-05 (BIA 2000). The respondent contends that he did not expressly waive his right to appeal (Resp. Br. at 7-10).
 
*2 Even if the respondent has properly preserved the issue for our consideration, after reviewing the transcript of the February 23, 2011, hearing, we conclude that the respondent accepted voluntary departure and effectively waived appeal. The Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure until June 22, 2011 (Tr. at 6). The Immigration Judge, at the end of the hearing, asked the respondent’s attorney, “respondent waives and accepts?” (Tr. at 7). The respondent’s attorney then answered in the affirmative. Our Ocampo decision stands for the proposition that the record must contain an express indication that an alien has waived his appellate rights. However, no particular wording is required to establish that the alien effectively waived the right to appeal. There is no indication in the record of any misunderstanding or confusion on the part of the respondent or his then counsel on this point.
 
Regarding the respondent’s assertion that the matter should be reopened on a sua sponte basis, he did not make this argument to the Immigration Judge in his motion to reopen. See Matter of Fedorenko, supra. Furthermore, the circumstances that the respondent described would not warrant reopening on a sua sponte basis.
 
On appeal, the respondent has submitted additional evidence regarding drug violence in Mexico. This Board, however, is an appellate body whose function is to review, not create, a record, and thus it would generally be inappropriate for us to accept this “new” evidence to supplement the record. See Matter of Fedorenko, supra. Any party seeking further fact-finding pursuant to newly-submitted evidence must file a motion to remand. In this case, the respondent has not done so.
 
If we were to construe the submission of new evidence as a motion to remand, we would deny it. The requirements for a motion to remand are essentially the same as the requirements for a motion to reopen. Rodriguez v. INS, 841 F.2d 865 (9th Cir. 1987). Specifically, “[a] motion to reopen [or remand] proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent must show that the evidence would establish his prima facie eligibility for relief or affect the outcome of the case. Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413,419 (BIA (1996); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Most of the evidence that the respondent submitted was not previously unavailable; it could have been filed with the motion to reopen. Also, the two articles which postdate the motion to reopen discuss drug violence, but do not show that the respondent would be targeted on account of a protected ground (Exhs. E, F).
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mariya Zarakhovich, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent filed a motion to reconsider on July 7, 2011. She seeks to have the Board reconsider its decision of June 8, 2011, which itself declined to reconsider a November 29, 2010, decision of the Board dismissing her appeal as untimely. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The Board’s June 8, 2011, decision considered that the respondent’s motion to reconsider was untimely filed. Section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). A motion to reconsider the Board’s November 29, 2010, decision was due by December 29, 2010, but was not submitted until January 4, 2011, was rejected for a filing defect, and filed on January 12, 2011. In any event, we concluded, the regulations clearly provide that the time for filing an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision runs from the date the decision is mailed, not the day that the decision is received. 8C.F.R. § 1003.38(b). Therefore, the motion to reconsider was denied on June 8, 2011.
 
The pending motion exceeds the numerical limitations for motions to reconsider. A party is limited to one motion to reconsider. Section 240(c)(6) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). Moreover, a party may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2).
 
The respondent’s counsel argues again that the appeal was filed late due to her mistake in calendaring the due date. In Matter of Liadov, 23 I&N Dec. 990 (BIA 2006), aff’d Liadov v. Mukasey, 518 F.3d 1003 (8th Cir. 2008), the Board concluded that it has the authority to consider a late appeal by certification under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c), under appropriate circumstances, where exceptional circumstances are present. However, counsel’s failure to properly manage her cases does not excuse the failure to file a timely appeal. To the extent that counsel brings a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against herself, she has failed to comply with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making such a claim. The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Swaray Conteh, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael B. Dobson
Senior Attorney
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)] - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Nigeria. At the hearing before the Immigration Judge on January 13, 2010, she and her husband, who is also a native and citizen of Nigeria, reached an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in which the DHS agreed to withdraw a charge of removability pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act alleging that they attempted to obtain admission into the United States by fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact.1 In exchange, the couple accepted a final order of removal pursuant to section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Act. On February 10, 2011, the respondent filed a Motion to Reopen arguing that her agreement with the DHS was not voluntary. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion on April 7, 2010. The respondent now appeals that decision.2 We review the Immigration Judge’s factual findings for clear error and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent contends that her agreement with the DHS was not voluntary and that the Immigration Judge did not accurately explain the law to the respondent. See Respondent’s Brief at 6. Despite this contention, however, the transcript indicates that the Immigration Judge asked the respondent if she voluntarily agreed to concede that she abandoned her lawful permanent resident status and to accept a final removal order in exchange for the DHS’s agreement to withdraw the charge of removability pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) (Tr. at 7-8). The respondent responded several times inaudibly and ultimately said “Yes.” (Tr. at 8). The Immigration Judge asked the respondent if she understood that this would terminate her permanent resident status and the respondent said “I do know.” (Tr. at 8-9). The Immigration Judge also explained that the DHS was dropping the fraud charge (Tr. at 9). The Immigration Judge asked the respondent whether the details of the agreement were explained to her and if she “made this decision considering all of the factors and with the legal advice of [her] attorney.” (Tr. at 9). The respondent said “Right.” (Tr. at 9).3 As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent was upset when she answered the Immigration Judge’s questions (I.J. at 2). Nonetheless, she indicated that she understood this agreement.
 
*2 The respondent also argues that, pursuant to Hill v. City of Cleveland, 12 F.3d 575 (6th Cir. 1993) and Town of Newton v. Rumery, 480 U.S. 386 (1987), the respondent’s agreement was not entered voluntarily. See Respondent’s Brief at 7-10. We note, however, that these cases involved the rights of criminal defendants to enter a “release-dismissal agreement.” Further, pursuant to the factors listed in Hill, supra, in this case the respondent was not in custody when she entered the agreement, she was advised by counsel, and the agreement was entered into under the Immigration Judge’s supervision. See Hill, supra, at 578.
 
Further, to the extent that the respondent argues that her attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel, we note that the respondent did not attempt to satisfy the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board to apply the Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). Given the evidence presented, we uphold the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The DHS contends that the respondent and her husband misrepresented that they had been out of the United States for only 2 weeks when they were in Nigeria for 14 months (I.J. at 2). See Exh. A attached to DHS’s Answer to Motion to Reopen.

The respondent’s husband accepted the Immigration Judge’s decision as final (Tr. at 12).

The Immigration Judge stated that the DHS would withdraw the fraud charge which would otherwise be “a permanent bar” to the respondent’s return (Tr. at 9). As the respondent argues, the Immigration Judge did not discuss possible waivers with the respondent. See Respondent’s Brief at 8. As noted, however, the respondent was represented by counsel. Further, the respondent has not shown that this alleged error prejudiced the respondent or that she would be eligible for a waiver. See Ikharo v. Holder, 614 F.3d 622, 631 (6th Cir. 2010) (showing of prejudice is essentially a demonstration that the alleged violation affected the outcome of the proceedings). The respondent did not file an application for relief with her motion to reopen or on appeal, or explain what waiver she seeks. Although the respondent references a waiver under section 212(i) of the Act, she states, though counsel, that “[wjhether Respondent would have qualified for a waiver under [section 212(i)] is irrelevant” because its availability was not discussed (respondent’s brief at 8). See 8 C.F.R. § § 1003.23(b)(3) (stating that motions to reopen to apply for relief from the Immigration Judge must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and supporting documents), 1003.2(c)(same for motions to reopen to the Board).

IN RE: PETER AJUZIE
File: AXXX XX6 779 - New York, NY
December 29, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Olu Jaiyebo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 3, 2010, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on August 6, 2008. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in concluding that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel and that he did not exercise due diligence in seeking to reopen the proceedings.
 
The respondent states in the motion to reopen that his former attorney, Theophilus Maranga, informed him that his hearing had been scheduled for August 6, 2008. The respondent asserts that he was not able to attend his hearing on that date due to illness. The respondent submitted a doctor’s letter, which states that the respondent was treated on August 4, 2008, for acute bronchitis. The respondent claims that a friend of his delivered the medical note to the attorney’s office prior to the date of the hearing. He indicates that he was not able to contact Mr. Maranga by phone until early 2009, and he did not receive his file until July 2009, due to the transition of Mr. Maranga’s practice to a new law office that had bought his practice. The respondent states that at that time he became aware of the in absentia order of removal. The respondent asserts that as Mr. Maranga had ceased practicing law in the United States and had returned to Ghana, he was not able to inform Mr. Maranga of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, nor has he filed a complaint to the appropriate disciplinary authority regarding such representation. The respondent filed his motion to reopen on November 15, 2010.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established that he failed to appear for his hearing due to exceptional circumstances as required by section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). While the letter from the physician indicates a date of service as August 4, 2008, the letter itself is not dated. The respondent explains that the handwritten number on the letter is the doctor’s license number. However, the doctor has not included the name of the state in which he is licensed. Moreover, although the respondent contends that he provided his former attorney with the doctor’s letter prior to his hearing date, Mr. Maranga was present at the hearing and did not mention or submit the letter allegedly provided by the respondent.
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the alien has satisfied the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has determined that the deadline for motions to reopen deportation proceedings may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124,130 (2d Cir. 2000). However, in order to equitably toll the filing deadline for a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate that he has exercised due diligence during the entire period he seeks to toll. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008). This includes both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed. Id; see also Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006) (court concluded that aliens had demonstrated that their counsel was ineffective in informing them that they did not need to appear at a hearing, but they had not met their burden of showing why they had not been diligent over a two-year period).
 
*2 The respondent has not complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent contends that he did not file a complaint with a disciplinary authority because Mr. Maranga left the United States shortly after the respondent was ordered removed. While Mr. Maranga’s departure may have prevented the respondent from informing Mr. Maranga of the allegations leveled against him, it would not have prevented him from filing a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Moreover, the respondent stated in a sworn statement submitted with his motion to reopen that he learned of the in absentia order of removal in July 2009. However, the respondent did not seek reopening until November 2010. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel, nor did the respondent exercise due diligence as required for equitable tolling. See Rashid v. Mukasey, supra. Consequently, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX9 882 - Omaha, NE

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alison M. Brown, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anastasie M. Senat
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Termination; remand
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on May 29, 2009, when we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge to “prepare a new decision,” given that the name on the decision referred to a different alien, and the decision referred to forms of relief for which the respondent did not apply. On remand, the Immigration Judge amended his decision to correct the errors. The respondent has appealed. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has opposed the appeal. The record will be remanded once again to the Immigration Judge.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including any determination of credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met their burdens of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On remand before the Immigration Judge, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, along with evidence of his compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Immigration Judge declined to adjudicate the motion, finding that consideration of the motion would exceed the scope of the remand. We disagree.
 
As a general rule, when we remand a case to an Immigration Judge, the remand is effective for the stated purpose and for consideration of other appropriate matters, unless the Board qualifies or limits the remand for a specific purpose. See Matter of Patel, 16 I&N Dec. 600, 601 (BIA 1978). Although we remanded the matter for a specific purpose, the situation here is akin to that which we considered in Matter of M-D-, 24 I&N Dec. 138 (BIA 2007). In that case, we held that when a case is remanded for the specific and limited purpose of conducting background checks, the Immigration Judge reacquires jurisdiction over the proceedings and may consider additional evidence if it is material, was not previously available, and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. Id. at 141-42, see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(1) and 1003.23(b)(3).
 
Thus, the Immigration Judge in the instant case reacquired jurisdiction over the proceedings on remand and had the authority to consider the respondent’s motion to reopen.1 Therefore, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge to consider the new evidence presented by the respondent and to adjudicate the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jerome D. Lee, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jill K. Jensen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Korea, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 25, 2010, finding the respondent’s application abandoned, but granting voluntary departure. The respondent has also moved for a remand. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied, but the record will be remanded for further proceedings concerning the Immigration Judge’s grant of voluntary departure.
 
In her decision, the Immigration Judge explained that, since the respondent had not filed the necessary evidence to establish her prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status by the January 4, 2010, deadline set by order issued at the prior hearing of June 18, 2009, the respondent had abandoned her application for relief. See I.J. at 2-3; Exh. 4.1 The Immigration Judge acknowledged the respondent’s argument that the untimely filing was solely the fault of her prior attorney, but found that not to be a valid reason to warrant a further continuance. Id. On appeal, the respondent reiterates her allegations that her untimely filing was her prior attorney’s fault and that she received ineffective assistance from that prior counsel, and asks that her case be remanded to allow the Immigration Judge to evaluate the evidence that she has submitted to establish prima facie eligibility.
 
In order to establish ineffective assistance of prior counsel, an alien must establish that his or her counsel’s performance was so deficient that it impinged the ‘fundamental fairness’ of the hearing and caused prejudice, which exists when the performance was so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. See Ali v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 643 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2011), citing Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, 178 F.3d 1139, 1146 (11th Cir.1999); see also Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273-4 (11th Cir.2005).
 
In Matter of Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), we held that claims based on ineffective assistance of counsel require (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of the counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. The Eleventh Circuit has determined that the Board may require aliens to satisfy the three-part Lozada test. See Gbaya v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 342 F.3d 1219 (11th Cir.2003).
 
*2 We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request for a further continuance on the basis of abandonment. We have held that the decision to grant or deny a continuance for good cause is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge and will not be overturned on appeal unless it is shown that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6. Here, the respondent attributed to her prior attorney her untimely filing of the necessary evidence, but did not demonstrate compliance with any of the three Lozada requirements. Thus, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination not to accept the untimely-filed evidence. We also agree that, given these circumstances, the Immigration Judge could find that the respondent had not shown to be prima facie eligible for adjustment of status and had not shown good cause to warrant a further delay in the proceedings. See generally Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785-789 (BIA 2009) (citing apparent statutory eligibility for adjustment as one of the factors to weigh in determining whether good cause exists for granting a continuance).
 
On appeal, the respondent has submitted an affidavit in which she reiterates her testimony that the delay in submitting the evidence required in the June 18, 2009, written order was solely the fault of her prior attorney. The respondent, however, has not submitted evidence that she has informed her prior attorney of her allegations against him (other than claiming, without actual proof, that her prior attorney “candidly admitted what had happened”) and that she has given him an opportunity to respond. She has also specifically stated in her affidavit that she has not yet filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities against that attorney. Therefore, since the respondent has not yet shown substantial compliance with the Lozada criteria, we are unpersuaded to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision and find no reason to grant a remand.
 
At the conclusion of the respondent’s last hearing, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure in the amount of 60 days, with no bond set, and specifically advised the respondent that she had the right to file an appeal. See I.J. at 10-11. However, the Immigration Judge completed a form indicating that the respondent was being granted pre-conclusion voluntary departure, which requires knowing and voluntary waiver of an alien’s appeal rights. See section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b). If the Immigration Judge intended to grant post-conclusion voluntary departure, the respondent should have been required to show that she meets the four requirements set forth in the Act for granting such relief, which includes posting a minimum bond of $500. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c). Under these circumstances, we will return the record to the Immigration Judge to clarify which form of voluntary departure she intended to grant the respondent and to determine whether the respondent meets all of the corresponding requirements for the form of voluntary departure granted. A new decision shall thereafter be entered and the appropriate voluntary departure warnings provided. See Matter of Gamero, 25 I&N Dec. 164 (BIA 2010). Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: With respect to the Immigration Judge’s grant of voluntary departure, the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

Specifically, the written order issued by the Immigration Judge on June 18, 2009, advised the respondent that she must file documentation to establish the bona fides of her marriage by January 4, 2010. It also warned her that failure to do so “will be viewed as an abandonment of the relief sought.” See Exh. 4; see also Tr. at 3-4.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dalbir Singh, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jose Rivera
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision mailed on December 23, 2010, denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia and in a decision mailed on October 26, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen.1 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
Upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion to reconsider is time-barred. In this case the respondent’s motion to reconsider was initially received on November 26, 2010, but was rejected since the required filing fee was incorrectly submitted to the Immigration Court. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.24(a) (stating that the Immigration Court does not collect fees). Thereafter, the motion to reconsider was filed on December 3, 2010, more than 30 days after the Immigration Judge’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the principles for reconsideration). The respondent argues for the first time on appeal that the delay was due to an error at her attorney’s office. Even if equitable tolling is taken into consideration, her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not satisfy any of the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”). We therefore find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s determination that the motion to reconsider was untimely.
 
The respondent has submitted evidence on appeal including documentation that was submitted with her motion to reconsider. We do not consider evidence first submitted on appeal; rather, we review the record before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 73-74 & n.10 (BIA 1984); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988). To the extent that the submission of evidence could be construed as a motion to reopen the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion to reconsider, such a motion is numerically-barred. Absent certain exceptions, an alien is permitted to file only one motion to reopen and one motion to reconsider.2 See sections 240(c)(6)(A), (7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(A), (7)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). See generally Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000) (holding that a motion to remand submitted during the pendency of an appeal from an Immigration Judge’s denial of an untimely motion to reopen and filed after the entry of a final administrative decision is not excepted from the numerical restriction that permits the filing of only one motion to reopen). The respondent has already filed a motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge and then filed an untimely motion to reconsider. We therefore find that a remand is not warranted because it is number barred.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

There is no evidence in the record that the respondent appealed the Immigration Judge’s October 26, 2010, decision. In that decision the Immigration Judge considered the respondent’s claim that she failed to appear for her December 19, 2000, hearing due to lack of notice. The Immigration Judge found that notice was proper since the respondent was personally served with a Notice to Appear and since she subsequently appeared at the San Juan Immigration Court on July 13, 2000, and was provided with notice of her hearing. See Exhs. 1, 3(a), 3(b). We note that the record also reflects that on July 10, 2000, the San Juan Immigration Court sent a notice of hearing to the respondent at her last known address which was not returned to the court. See Exhs. 3, 2.

The evidence presented does not raise an exception to the time and number limitations governing motions to reopen. See, e.g., sections 240(c)(7)(C)(ii), (iv) of the Act.

IN RE: JOSE LUIS RODRIGUEZ-GONZALEZ A.K.A. MIGUEL GAMORA MORALES A.K.A. JOSE MORA GONZALEZ
File: AXXX XX7 536 - Los Angeles, California
December 14, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Margaret Reyes, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s September 22, 2011, decision, finding him removable as charged, based on his admissions (Tr. at 2); and ordering his removal. The appeal will be dismissed. The respondent’s request to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is granted under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). See Matter of Chicas, 19 I&N Dec. 114 (BIA 1984).
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clear erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Removability is not at issue and the gravamen of the respondent’s appeal is a denial of due process claim premised on allegations of ineffective assistance by his former attorney’s presentation of his case. Where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is made, the Board has found that certain criteria must be met. Specifically, the claim must be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make, counsel must be informed of the allegations against him and provided an opportunity to respond, and the respondent must indicate whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Even assuming arguendo, that the affidavit of the respondent accompanying the appellate brief would satisfy the first requirement, the second of those criteria is that “before allegations of ineffective assistance of former counsel are presented to the Board, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond.” Id. (emphasis added). We observed that this requirement exists to provide attorneys “whose integrity or competence is being impugned, [the opportunity] to present [their] version of events,” if they choose to do so, and serves to discourage baseless allegations. Id. The respondent has provided no evidence that he has informed his former counsel of the allegations against him and allowed him the opportunity to timely respond. The respondent has failed to comply with this critical Lozada requirement. Furthermore, the respondent has submitted no evidence that he filed a complaint with the California State Bar concerning his former counsel’s performance, or explained his failure to do so.
 
*2 We acknowledge that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, has stated that rigid adherence to the Lozada requirements is not always required. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). The respondent argues that full compliance is not required here where the ineffective assistance is “plain on its face.” See e.g., Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 938 (9th Cir. 2003) (ineffectiveness was plain on its face where former counsel mis-calendared the removal hearing, petitioner failed to appear at the hearing, and declarations were filed that complied with the first two prongs of Lozada); and Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 824-25 (9th Cir. 2003) (ineffectiveness was plain on its face where former counsel forgot to file the brief because he was transitioning to a new job and taking over a former colleague’s caseload, and declarations were filed satisfying the first prong of Lozada). However, on de novo review, we find that the alleged ineffective assistance here, is not “plain on its face,” where respondent’s former counsel obtained several continuances to “explore possible relief [from removal]” (Tr. at 3, 6-7, 10-11) (emphasis added). See Tamang v. Holder, 598 F.3d 1083, 1090 (9th Cir. 2010) (finding the ineffectiveness of alien’s former counsel’s assistance is not plain on its face). Aside from the respondent’s challenge on appeal that he did not really intend to forgo a request for voluntary departure,1 the respondent has not identified any other forms of relief from removal that his former counsel failed to request, as they had agreed.
 
The court acknowledges that “[t]he goal of Lozada was to provide a more objective basis from which to assess the veracity of the substantial number of ineffective assistance claims … and to hold attorneys to appropriate standards of performance,” and “[w]here these goals are furthered, courts have unanimously upheld the requirements set forth in Lozada.” See Id. Thus, notice to the attorney whose actions are being challenged, with sufficient time to respond, is a central element in this Board’s capacity to adjudicate “ineffective assistance of counsel” claims. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding that notification to former counsel is not only “required” for an ineffective assistance claim, but also that former counsel must be afforded an adequate “opportunity to respond” before the aggrieved respondent filed his motion to reopen with the Board). Consequently, as the respondent has not complied with this critical procedural requirement, he has not established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*3 Nonetheless, even assuming arguendo that he had demonstrated substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements, the respondent still has not shown that a remand for further proceedings is warranted, as he has not shown “prejudice.” See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (Board held that satisfying the Lozada procedural requirements is in and of itself an insufficient reason to reopen, and that an attorney’s failure to file an appeal on behalf of an alien is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel). In order to establish a valid due process claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must demonstrate that his former attorney’s deficient performance was prejudicial. See Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 587 (9th Cir. 2006) (citing Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 903 (9th Cir. 2003) (concluding that an attorney’s “flawed” performance did not provide a basis for a due process claim because the alien could not “demonstrate that counsel’s alleged malfeasance prejudiced his claim for relief.”)); Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra, at 527 (“Due process challenges to deportation proceedings require a showing of prejudice to succeed.”). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, supra.
 
However, the court has found that even where former counsel’s performance was inadequate but the alien still had an opportunity to present his claim, “[p]rejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” See Ray v. Gonzales, supra, at 587 (quoting Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999); see also Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir. 2004) (stating that “to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must show both error and prejudice”). In this regard, the court has held that the alien may not benefit from the presumption of prejudice, if he fails to provide “plausible grounds for relief.” See Siong v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 376 F.3d 1030, 1037 (9th Cir. 2004).
 
In the matter before us, however, the respondent neither challenges the Immigration Judge’s findings as to his removability, nor does he identify a plausible basis for any relief or protection from removal that his former counsel failed to request, as agreed. “Ineffective assistance of counsel in a deportation proceeding is a denial of due process under the Fifth Amendment if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.” See Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1985). The respondent has not met that burden. The record reflects that the respondent was afforded a full and fair hearing.
 
*4 Consequently, as the respondent has not demonstrated compliance with the Lozada procedural requirements, or any resultant prejudice from his former attorney’s alleged deficient representation, that affected the outcome of these proceedings, the respondent has not established that he suffered a denial of due process based on his claims of ineffective assistance of former counsel, and has not shown that a remand for further proceedings is warranted.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note, parenthetically, that the record reflects that the respondent did not speak up and contradict the statement by his former counsel at the September 22, 2011, hearing, in response to the query posed by the Immigration Judge, that after having fully discussed the issue with him, the respondent did not wish to pursue voluntary departure (Tr. at 14). Furthermore, the respondent, on appeal, has not presented any evidence that he was either statutorily qualified for voluntary departure, or that he warranted a grant of said relief, as a matter of discretion. See Matter of Arguelles-Campos, 22 I&N Dec. 811 (BIA 1999); Matter of Gamboa, 14 I&N Dec. 244 (BIA 1972).
