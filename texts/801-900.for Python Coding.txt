IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mary Elizabeth Delli-Pizzi, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
David H. Burke
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
 
*1 The respondent has appealed an October 9, 2007, decision of the Immigration Judge denying his motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia deportation order that was entered on July 12, 1991, under former section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b) (which applies when service, or attempted service, of the notice of hearing, is made prior to June 13, 1992). See Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
As we noted in our June 11, 2007, remand order, although the respondent’s motion was filed 13 years after the entry of the in absentia order, there is no time limit to file a motion for purposes of rescinding an in absentia order under former section 242(b) of the Act. Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155 (BIA 1999); Matter of Mancera, 22 I&N Dec. 79 (BIA 1998). Therefore, the DHS’s arguments on appeal regarding equitable tolling and the lack of due diligence are not relevant to our consideration of the respondent’s case.
 
Furthermore, we adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the respondent has failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, except as noted herein. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent argues that his former attorney never notified him of the July 9, 1991, hearing date, even though the attorney was aware of his address (Tab 2, Respondent’s affidavit).
 
Although the respondent filed a bar complaint against the former attorney and notified the attorney of the allegations, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s affidavit does not satisfy the standard established in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). That case requires that the respondent submit an affidavit “setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard.” However, the respondent’s affidavit states only that the attorney “clearly had my address in Chicago when he received the notices from the Court. He had filed a Motion for Bond Redetermination on my behalf, and listed my address in Chicago on those forms” (Aff. at 1). That motion was filed on May 29, 1991, and listed the respondent’s address as “2514 4th Central Park Avenue” in Chicago. However, upon his release from custody on June 5, 1991. only 7 days later, the respondent’s address is listed as “4826 N. Merrimac” on all of the bond paperwork, the same as the obligor (Tab B). Thus, at the time that the Notice of Hearing was issued on June 13, 1991, the most recent address in the record for the respondent was different from the one which he claims was correct. However, the respondent’s affidavit fails to provide any details as to when he gave the attorney his address, how long he resided there, or why a different address was listed on official documentation only a week later. The respondent argues that it is not his burden to provide such details. However, it is his burden to submit sufficient evidence from which we can determine that counsel was ineffective in failing to notify him of the hearing. Although the respondent’s current attorney argues that there is no evidence that the respondent personally provided the “Merrimac” address, and that even if he did, no notice was ever received at that address (Br. at 12), the respondent himself has never made any such assertions. See Matter of S-M-, 22 I&N Dec. 49, 51 (BIA 1998) (statements made by counsel in a brief or motion are not considered evidence and thus are not entitled to any evidentiary weight).
 
*2 The respondent also argues that it was improper for the Immigration Judge to accept DHS’s representation that the Central Park address provided by the respondent does not exist. However, the respondent has never denied or disproved that assertion. Morever, even if the Immigration Judge erred in this regard, such error was harmless, as we still uphold the finding that the affidavit was deficient under Matter of Lozada, supra. Furthermore, because we uphold the Immigration Judge’s finding that the evidentiary requirements of Lozada have not been met, we need not address the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by former counsel’s actions.
 
Moreover, we find no merit to the argument that the superceding Order to Show Cause (OSC) was not served on the respondent (Br. at 14), as the document itself reflects on its face that it was served on the respondent on May 24, 1991 (Form I-221S, “OSC”, Exh. 1). We also reject the respondent’s claim that the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction over his motion because he did not “reopen” proceedings upon remand (Br. at 12-13). Reopening was not necessary, as our June 11, 2007, order vacated our prior decision and remanded the case for further proceedings. Finally, given our disposition of this case, the respondent’s challenge to the denial of his motion to change venue is moot. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: DION RHOAN MCPHERSON
File: AXXX XX6 600 - Buffalo, NY

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joan O. Pinnock, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Adam N. Greenway
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In a decision dated June 17, 2008, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. An Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent deported in absentia for his failure to appear for a hearing on June 18, 1992. The respondent filed a timely appeal from that decision. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
On appeal, the respondent states that he has been a lawful permanent resident since November 14, 1986. The respondent contends that he failed to appear for his hearing due to exceptional circumstances, as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel and because he was recovering from a gunshot wound at the time. He claims that he is eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). The respondent indicates that he was not aware of the deportation order against him until he was arrested by the Department of Homeland Security. He has submitted an affidavit on appeal.
 
Initially, we note that the deportation proceedings were conducted in absentia under section 242(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b). Pursuant to Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993), section 242(b) applies “where an in absentia order is made in exclusion proceedings, or in deportation proceedings following service or attempted service of the notice of a hearing, for which the alien failed to appear, made prior to June 13, 1992, the effective date for the procedures specified in section 242B of the Act.” As service of the hearing notice in the instant matter occurred prior to June 13, 1992, section 242(b) of the Act is applicable in this case. Consequently, the Immigration Judge incorrectly applied the “exceptional circumstances” standard for the respondent’s failure to appear. See I.J. Dec. dated June 17, 2008, at 3-4. The applicable standard is “reasonable cause.”
 
We find that the respondent’s motion to reopen was timely filed. We have determined that the applicable regulations do not contain any time or numerical limitations on aliens who wish to file a motion to reopen to vacate an underlying order of deportation entered pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act. See Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155, 1157 (BIA 1999); 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii). We reached the same result in the context of exclusion proceedings. See Matter of N-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 590 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Mancera, 22 I&N Dec. 79 (BIA 1998) (discussing the timeliness of motions to reopen proceedings conducted in absentia under section 242(b) of the Act).
 
*2 Furthermore, the respondent contended in his motion that he never received any notice from his former attorney, and he assumed that his attorney handled his case and that no further appearance was necessary. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute “reasonable cause” where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997). However, the respondent has not complied with all of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. Therefore, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
As previously discussed, section 242(b) applies when service, or attempted service of the notice of hearing, is made prior to June 13, 1992. See Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, supra. The applicable notice of hearing is dated March 25, 1992. Therefore, the respondent need only establish “reasonable cause” for his failure to appear. See Matter of Cruz-Garcia, supra, at 1158 (the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(1) applies only to deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(Supp. II 1990)). The Board may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The Supplementary Information to this regulation explained that the Board should defer to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but that it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493, 496 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500, 501 (BIA 2008); 67 Fed. Reg. At 54,888-89 (Supplementary Information). Therefore, in light of the Immigration Judge’s failure to apply the correct standard of “reasonable cause,” we find that a remand to the Immigration Judge is warranted for a specific finding on this issue. See Matter of Peugnet, 20 I&N Dec. 233 (BIA 1991); Matter of Ruiz, 20 I&N Dec. 91 (BIA 1989); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988); Matter of Nafi, 19 I&N Dec. 430 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. § 242.1(c)(1990). Accordingly, the record will be remanded.
 
*3 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Melissa N. Henke, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
George W. Maugans
Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. Alleging ineffective assistance of his former counsel, the respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 11, 2007, decision finding the respondent removable as charged and ordering the respondent removed to Mexico, and requests a remand. The respondent has complied with the guidelines described in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1stCir. 1988), and asserts that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance both during the respondent’s bond proceeding and during the respondent’s February 9, 2007, removal hearing. The record is remanded.¿FN1 º
 
As an initial matter, with respect to the issue relating to the bond proceeding, we note that bond proceedings are required by regulation to be separate and apart from removal proceedings. See 8C.F.R. § 1003.19(d); see also Matter of P-C-M-, 20 I&N Dec. 432(BIA 1991); Matter of Balderas, 20 I&N Dec. 389 (BIA 1991). As a result, we will not consider the issues relating to the respondent’s bond proceedings in this appeal from the removal order.
 
Turning to the merits of the appeal, the respondent contends that his former attorney was ineffective because she admitted the allegations and conceded to the charge of removability contained in the Notice to Appear when she planned to and did eventually argue that such evidence should be suppressed as a product of the Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) egregious conduct pursuant to the exclusionary rule (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 2; Exh. 1). In addition, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge improperly relied on documents that were submitted only in connection with his bond proceedings. In the alternative, the respondent appears to assert that, if the records were indeed submitted in connection with his removal hearing, such submission further demonstrates his former counsel’s deficient performance.
 
The record reveals that at the respondent’s February 9, 2007, removal hearing, the Immigration Judge believed that the respondent’s case “was involved in a suppression type case.” (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 2). However, no motion to suppress had been filed in the respondent’s case at that time. Instead, as the Immigration Judge noted, the record reveals that on February 7, 2007, two days prior to the respondent’s removal hearing, documents evidencing the respondent’s alienage and manner of entry into this country, which had previously been filed in connection with the respondent’s bond hearing, had been re-filed with the Immigration Court (I.J. at 2; Exh. 3). The record further reveals that when the Immigration Judge informed the parties that he had received such documents, the respondent’s former counsel did not object or indicate in any way that she did not file such documents in connection with the respondent’s removal hearing. Rather, the respondent’s former counsel admitted the allegations and conceded to the charge of removability (Tr. at 2).¿FN2º A motion to suppress was ultimately filed on February 22, 2007 (Exh. 4). On April 11, 2007, noting that the respondent had already conceded to the charge of removability and that the record contains independent evidence of the respondent’s alienage and manner of entry that had been submitted by the respondent’s counsel, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to suppress, found the respondent removable as charged, and ordered the respondent removed to Mexico (I.J, at 2-3; Tr. at 7-15).
 
*2 At the outset, we find that, for the reasons identified by the Immigration Judge, the Immigration Judge committed no error in relying on both the respondent’s concession to the charge of removability and the documents supplied by respondent’s former counsel in finding the respondent removable as charged at the February 9, 2007, hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c); Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986); cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(B) (authorizing summary dismissal of appeals when “¿tºhe only reason for the appeal specified by the party concerned involves a finding of fact or a conclusion of law that was conceded by that party at a prior proceeding”); see also see also Matter of Cervantes-Torres, 21 I&N Dec. 351, 353 (BIA 1996) (recognizing that the exclusionary rule has no application where the government learned of the evidence from an independent source) (citations omitted). However, notwithstanding the propriety of the Immigration Judge’s actions, it is clear that the respondent’s former attorney’s actions prejudiced the respondent. See Matter of Lozada, supra; Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); but see Afanwi v. Mukasey, 526 F.3d 788, 796-799 (4th Cir. 2008) (finding no constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment to effective assistance of retained counsel in a removal proceeding). Even the Immigration Judge recognized as much (Tr. at 8-9,13-15). Under the circumstances, we find that a remand is appropriate for further proceedings on the issue of the respondent’s removability.

The respondent’s appellate fee waiver request is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3)(2008). However, his request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). Likewise, as we find this matter inappropriate for three member review, the respondent’s request for such review is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(6).

The transcript of those proceedings in no way supports the respondent’s claim on appeal that his former counsel informed the Immigration Judge that she “was not prepared, that she had not consulted with her client, and that to require her to continue with the hearing at that time would force her to provide ineffective assistance of counsel.” (Resp. Br. at 7). Nor does it support the respondent’s contention that the Immigration Judge “pushed” the respondent’s former counsel to admit or deny the allegations in the Notice to Appear. Indeed, the respondent’s former counsel indicated that the respondent received the Notice to Appear and understood the nature of the proceedings and his rights (Tr. at 2).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mark S. Kocol, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jessica Galassi
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on March 2, 2004, at which time we affirmed without opinion an Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 28, 2003. The respondent has moved to reopen the proceedings due to allegations of ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The motion will be granted; the Board’s March 2, 2004, order, will be vacated; and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings, and the entry of a new decision.
 
In a detailed brief supported by substantial documentation, the respondent has presented a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding Thomas Royce, her previous counsel.¿FN1º The motion fully complies with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 191 & N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (copy of grievance complaint filed with the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois, and their response indicating that they have initiated an inquiry into the matter; affidavit of respondent including, inter alia, a description of the work to be performed; and notification to prior counsel and his response thereto). The respondent has demonstrated that the actions of prior counsel effectively precluded her from presenting her claims for relief, and foreclosed the prospect of effectively pursuing an appellate challenge.¿FN2º Taken together, the evidence presents “egregious circumstances” and demonstrates that the respondent suffered prejudice as a result of the actions of prior counsel, and warrants reopening of the proceedings. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); see also Sanchez v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 641, 650 (7th Cir. 2007) (having found that counsel was ineffective, and that the record before the Immigration Judge (and thus the record that went to the BIA) was woefully incomplete, the court concluded that further proceedings are necessary so that the proper authorities can evaluate the legal claims and exercise their discretion on the basis of a presentation that is fair to the alien).
 
The Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to “exceptional circumstances.” See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000). The Board has found that ineffective assistance of counsel may amount to “exceptional circumstances.” See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). According to the respondent’s motion, prior counsel in this matter: (1) failed to prepare and timely file a promised application for cancellation of removal on behalf of the respondent despite having been granted an extension of the filing deadline by the Immigration Judge on several occasions; (2) failed to explain the import of the Immigration Judge’s denial of her application for cancellation of removal, as abandoned, directing her to provide him with a completed application and supporting documents, which she did, telling her that everything was going to be fine; (3) failed to advise and disclose to the respondent that he was filing an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision to the Board, and noting that she did not sign the appeal forms submitted to the Board, despite the fact the appeal form contains what purports to be her “signature;” (4) failed to notify the respondent that he filed a brief in support of the appeal; (5) advising the respondent, in response to a “bag and baggage” letter she had received and faxed to him, not to report as directed by the DHS, indicating that everything was going to be alright and that he would file a habeas corpus petition with the federal court; (6) while her former counsel did file a habeas corpus petition with the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, he never provided the respondent with a copy of the filing; (7) failed to advise and inform the respondent upon receiving a decision from the federal court denying habeas corpus petition for lack of prosecution; (8) failed to communicate any further with the respondent, and based on his previous representations, leading her to believe that everything was alright and that she was awaiting a rescheduling of her hearing.
 
*2 We note that included in the motion is her former counsel’s response, essentially confirming the respondent’s allegations. We consider, moreover, the respondent has presented evidence that her former counsel was suspended from practice for misconduct by the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois, on 3 separate occasions, most recently on September 20, 2006, and there is no indication he has since been reinstated. Consequently, when considered in conjunction with the failures cited above, which include lying and failing to disclose critical and material facts to the respondent, we find that these rise to the level of “exceptional circumstances,” warranting a grant of the reopening of the proceedings, as a matter of discretion. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations); Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373 (A.G. 2002); Ekimian v. INS, 303 F.3d 1153, 1156-60 (9th Cir. 2002) (acknowledging Board’s authority to reopen sua sponte is within its unfettered discretion).
 
We are not persuaded by the DHS’s arguments in opposition to the respondent’s motion. The DHS does not contest the respondent’s claim that prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance, and does not dispute that the respondent was prejudiced by counsel’s actions. Instead, the DHS argues the respondent’s motion should be dismissed as untimely and does not warrant “equitable tolling.” See Yuan Gao v. Mukasey, 519 F.3d 376, 377 (7th Cir. 2008) (noting that the doctrine of “equitable tolling” creates a defense to statutes of limitations and other nonjurisdictional filing deadlines for cases in which, despite due diligence, the plaintiff cannot sue within the statutory deadline); see also Pervaiz v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 488, 490 (7th Cir. 2005)(finding the 90-day deadline is a statute of limitations and therefore subject to equitable tolling).
 
However, the Seventh Circuit has determined that “the test for equitable tolling, both generally and in the immigration context, is not the length of the delay in filing the complaint or other pleading; it is whether the claimant could reasonably have been expected to have filed earlier.” See Pervaiz v. Gonzales, supra, at 490 (7th Cir. 2005); Williams v. Sims, 390 F.3d 958, 960 (7th Cir.2004); Shropshear v. Corporation Counsel, 275 F.3d 593, 595 (7 th Cir. 2001). In light of the issues raised in her motion and the letter in response to her allegations submitted by her former counsel,¿FN3º we consider that it was not unreasonable for the respondent not to have filed her motion earlier premised on her reliance on her former counsel’s continued reassurances; and that only upon her detention by DHS, did she become fully aware of the grievous consequences of her former counsel’s egregious conduct, and then acted diligently in submitting the instant motion, and has raised a prima facie claim for relief from removal. See Gaberov v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 590 (7th Cir. 2008) (court found that equitable tolling of the motions deadline was warranted despite the motion being filed 4 years late); Patel v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 1011, 1016 (7th Cir. 2006) (alien must show that his situation warrants equitable tolling, which, in turn, requires a showing of due diligence); see also Pervaiz v. Gonzales, supra.
 
*3 Accordingly, the motion will be granted.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s March 2, 2004, order, is vacated, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, and the entry of a new decision.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has determined that “there is no constitutional ineffective-assistance doctrine” in removal proceedings, noting that aliens are entitled to due process, not “a right to good lawyering.” Magala v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 523, 525 (7th Cir. 2005). Nonetheless, the court found that ineffective assistance can constitute a valid ground for reopening. See Stroe v. I.N.S., 256 F.3d 498, 501 (7th Cir. 2001) (citing Matter of Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir.1988)).

2

We note, in this regard, the Board summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision in this case, wherein the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, as abandoned, for failure to timely submit the application for the requested relief, despite being afforded numerous opportunities to do so.

3

We consider, in this regard, that her former counsel admits that “in the process of handling ¿herº immigration matters … ¿heº reassured her on various occasions to such an extent that she did not understand how grave the consequences were for her (from the court as well as the INS),” and that the “quiet period with INS that extended from the time ¿heº submitted the habeas petition (it was dismissed on March 14, 2005, due to lack of prosecution which ¿heº failed to notify ¿herº of as well) may have caused her to believe that she was back in control of her case.” Her former counsel posits that this was reasonable on her part due to his failure to communicate otherwise with her.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Noemi E. Masliah, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Adam P. Feller
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on July 17, 2001, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our previous March 30, 2001, decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s February 1, 2000, denial of his motion to reopen the respondent’s December 7, 1998, in absentia order. The respondent has now filed an untimely motion to reopen on May 19, 2008. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be granted pursuant to our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&NDec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
In his current motion, as in his original motion to reconsider which we denied on March 30, 2001,¿FN1º the respondent argues that an in absentia order should not have been issued against him because he appeared at the hearing 45 minutes late due to circumstances beyond his control. He elaborates, as he did in his original motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, that his subway train was delayed and that once he arrived at the courthouse, he was misdirected to the courtroom. Morever, for the first time, his current motion asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at this hearing from two prior attorneys, who failed to properly file a timely motion to reopen his in absentia hearing, and he was thereby precluded from presenting his applications for withholding of removal and voluntary departure. For its part, the DHS argues that the respondent’s description of the procedures at the courthouse are inaccurate, and that the respondent failed to submit any evidence in support of his claim that his subway train was late. The DHS does not address the respondent’s claim regarding the effectiveness of his prior counsels.
 
As an initial matter, we agree that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel from his former counselors. Subsequent to the in absentia order issued by the Immigration Judge, Ms. Reede, Esquire, informed the respondent that she would file a motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, but such motion was ultimately filed late and denied by the Immigration Judge on February 1, 2000. Inasmuch as Ms. Reede’s motion was late and deficient on its face, we can presume that the respondent was prejudiced thereby. See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Moreover, we find that the respondent’s second attorney, Mr. Oeser-Sweate, Esquire, failed to properly file an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his former counsel, and the lack of such a motion further prevented the respondent from presenting his requests for relief from removal. Id. In support of the respondent’s allegations, the respondent has submitted, inter alia, a copy of a motion prepared by Mr. Oeser-Sweate, outlining the ineffective nature of his prior counsel, and his accompanying affidavit, he alleges that this motion was improperly filed with the New York ICE office but never with the Immigration Court.¿FN2º The respondent has filed disciplinary complaints against Mr. Oeser-Sweate and Mr. Murado,¿FN3º and has substantially met the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has stated that “¿iºn a situation where ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from having the opportunity to present his case for relief, the filing deadline for motions to reopen will be equitably tolled until the ineffective assistance is, or should have been, discovered by a reasonable person in the situation.” See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 171 (2d Cir. 2006); citing Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir. 2000); see also Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154, 157 (2d Cir. 2006). In this case, we find that the respondent has adequately explained that his prior counsels prevented him from presenting his applications for relief, and in delaying his ability to file an ineffective assistance of counsel alleging this fact. The respondent, through current counsel, effectively sets forth this ineffective assistance of counsel claim with due diligence, inasmuch as it attempts to remedy Mr. Oeser-Sweate’s and Ms. Reede’s errors. See Cekic v. INS, supra, at 170 (“no matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled”). Specifically, the respondent has explained that his delay in the current motion resulted from the misleading assurances he received from Ms. Reede, and the inadequate representation provided by her and by Mr. Oeser-Sweate.
 
Lastly, we note that the Immigration Judge, in his February 1, 2000, denial of the respondent’s initial motion to reopen his in absentia hearing, held that even were the motion timely, he would still deny it because the respondent’s late train does not constitute “exceptional circumstances” to excuse his absence at the hearing (2000 I.J. Dec. at 3). However, were it not for Ms. Reede and Mr. Murado’s inability to appear at the hearing at the proper time, and their failure to properly guide the respondent through the process once he arrived at the Immigration Court, he may have avoided an in absentia removal order. In this vein, we note that recent case law out of United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held that such short delays may not be considered a “failure to appear” for purposes of in absentia hearings. See Abu Hasirah v. DHS, 478 F.3d 474 (2d Cir. 2007). In short, given the circumstances, we find that the motions deadline should be excused under our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, supra. Accordingly, the record is remanded in order to afford the respondent an opportunity to pursue his application for withholding of removal before the Immigration Judge, as well as his more recent request to apply for adjustment of status based on an approved Form I-130 visa petition.

The respondent’s motion to reconsider, which we denied on July 17, 2001, merely argued that we “rubber-stamped” the Immigration Judge’s December 7, 1998, in our March 30, 2001, decision. It does not directly address the underlying in absentia decision, but in effect requests that the Board reconsider the basis of the Immigration Judge’s in absentia removal order.

We note, incidentally, that the motion posits the same claims present in the pending motion to reopen.

The respondent has indicated that Ms. Reede is now deceased. Mr. Murado, Esquire, assisted Ms. Reede in her representation of the respondent.

File: AXXX XX9 639 - Boston, MA
September 11, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Obadan Iziokhai, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s order dated November 16, 2007. The appeal will be sustained.
 
The facts and pertinent history of the case are as follows. On September 1, 2006, the respondent filed (with the Immigration Court) his Application to Adjust Status (Form I-485) and supporting documents, including an approval notice for the visa petition filed on his behalf by his United States citizen spouse. On July 27, 2007, the Immigration Court sent a hearing notice for October 30, 2007, to the respondent’s former counsel (Gordie Daniels). The respondent did not appear for the October 30, 2007, hearing and the Immigration Judge subsequently entered an in absentia order.
 
The respondent filed a motion to reopen on November 5, 2007. The respondent’s motion was supported by his declaration made under the penalty of perjury. The respondent stated in his declaration that on or about October 25, 2007, present counsel (Obadan Iziokhai) informed the respondent he would represent him at the next hearing because Mr. Daniels was out of the country. The respondent stated that Mr. Iziokhai informed him the hearing was set for October 31, 2007. The respondent stated Mr. Iziokhai told him that he could not find the respondent’s file at Mr. Daniel’s office so he contacted the Immigration Court and was told by a clerk the hearing was scheduled for October 31, 2007.¿FN1º The respondent stated that he and his wife appeared for the hearing at the Immigration Court on October 31, 2007, and were told the hearing had been conducted on October 30, 2007. The respondent also submitted in support of his motion a letter from his employer which stated that he had taken off from work on October 31, 2007, specifically to attend the hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion in a brief order dated November 16, 2007 (and mailed on November 26, 2007). The respondent timely appealed.
 
Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), provides, in pertinent part, an in absentia order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the removal order if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances.
 
We find that the respondent has shown exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear at the October 30, 2007, hearing. In Kaweesa v. Gonzales, 450 F.3d 62, 68 (1st Cir. 2006), the court stated that in deciding the validity of a claim of exceptional circumstances, the totality of the circumstances must be considered. Here the respondent appeared for the hearing the next day (October 31, 2007), obtained a letter from his employer which stated he took off work on October 31, 2007, specifically to attend the hearing, and promptly filed a motion to reopen supported by his declaration and the employer letter on November 5, 2007. We note that the respondent appears eligible for adjustment of status, based on an approved immediate relative visa petition filed on his behalf. Although the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to allege ineffective assistance of counsel have not been met, it is clear from the record that the respondent did not appear for the October 30, 2007, hearing because of misinformation from Mr. Iziokhai. We held in Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996), that ineffective assistance of counsel could constitute exceptional circumstances to rescind an in absentia order. We noted that an alien is not required to show prejudice in order to rescind an in absentia order. Id, at 473 n.2. We thus conclude that the respondent has shown exceptional circumstances.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s decision is reversed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.

File: AXXX XX0 715 - Miami, FL
September 8, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Louis Gvzmann, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This is an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision of October 15, 2007, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, on the ground that he did not file his motion within 90 days of the Immigration Judge’s decision of June 15, 2007, as required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent had not established changed country conditions in the country to which removal has been ordered, Honduras, and that the respondent therefore failed to demonstrate that he qualified for an exception to the filing requirements. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4). The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent had not established the prerequisites needed to reopen this matter based on ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion requesting a stay of his voluntary departure, on the ground that no substantial grounds had been advanced to warrant its grant. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that he filed two motions to reopen, and the Miami Immigration Court ignored his request and, failed to act, and neither denied nor approved either of the two motions. He also claims that the Immigration Court did not entertain his motion to stay his voluntary departure, or to change venue to the Orlando Immigration Court. He asserts that he is entitled to this relief so that he can have his case reopened and pursue his claim for asylum relief.
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge did in fact, issue a decision dated October 15, 2007, in response to the respondent’s motions. The record also reflects that the respondent’s attorney was served with the Immigration Judge’s decision on October 16, 2007. A timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion was filed with this Board by counsel for the alien on October 21, 2007.
 
We will deny the respondent’s motion, as it failed to meet the regulatory requirements. A motion to reopen on factual grounds must be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary materials. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The applicant must show that the evidence is material, unavailable at the time of the original hearing, and could not have been discovered or presented at the original hearing. Such a motion shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that these criteria are met. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Upon review of the respondent’s motion we find that he has submitted no evidentiary material, other than his own affidavit, and does not assert that there is material evidence which was unavailable and could not have been discovered at the original hearing. The respondent’s motion therefore does not meet the aforementioned regulatory criteria. We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to demonstrate that he was rendered ineffective assistance of counsel, as he did not meet the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and therefore a claim of ineffective assistance could not serve as a basis for the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
*2 In this case, it appears that the respondent’s motion was not timely, as the record reflects that the Immigration Judge’s decision was rendered on June 15, 2007, and the respondent’s motion was not received by this Board until September 18, 2007. We note that the respondent sought a stay of his voluntary departure. However, since his motion to reopen was not timely, the recent Supreme Court decision in Dada v. Mukasey, 123 S. Ct. 2307 (2008), does not apply to this case. We find that Dada requires that, in order for the alien to be allowed to obtain the benefit of its holding, i.e., the right to unilaterally withdraw his/her voluntary departure request without regard to the merits of the motion to reopen, the alien’s motion to reopen must be timely, i.e., filed within 90 days. We note that the Court cites to the statutory provision governing the deadline for filing motions to reopen, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). Moreover, the Court noted that its decision to allow an alien to withdraw his/her voluntary departure request and pursue his/her motion is premised, at least in part, upon the notion that it is completely foreseeable that the time allowed for voluntary departure will expire long before the BIA issues a decision on a timely filed motion to reopen. Id. at 2316. We find that this clearly shows that Dada mandates that the respondent’s motion to reopen be timely in order for him to be able to withdraw his voluntary departure request and pursue his motion. Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Laura A. Michalec
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
  
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen; termination of proceedings
 
In a decision dated January 9, 2007, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable, and ordered him removed to Ecuador. The respondent’s appeal to the Board was denied as untimely on May 14, 2007. On June 4, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s April 22, 2008, untimely motion to reopen. The respondent appealed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is an approximately 52-year-old native and citizen of Ecuador. The respondent entered the United States on or about April 28, 1974, as a visitor. He adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident on or about August 30, 1979. On February 28, 2006, he was convicted in the Supreme Court, New York County, New York, of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, cocaine. He was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment. He did not file a direct appeal. The Supreme Court, New York County, New York, agreed to accept his late appeal on May 15, 2007. The respondent asserts that the proceedings should be reopened, even though his motion is untimely, because his conviction is no longer final; further, his attorney did not file an appeal leading to the dismissal of his pro se appeal as untimely. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) opposes the motion because, it argues, the motion is untimely and he remains removable for the 2006 conviction. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23.
 
Arguably, the respondent has not substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). He did not inform his former attorney that he was filing a complaint with the New York State Bar to give him an opportunity to respond to the allegations. Nevertheless, the motion to reopen depends on the argument that his former counsel was ineffective by failing to file an appeal. We note there is no evidence the respondent and his attorney agreed to file an appeal. The attorney was not clear that he would file an appeal at the hearing and the respondent at that time was given instructions how to file an appeal and the proper forms (Tr. at 12-15). The respondent himself subsequently filed an untimely appeal on March 28, 2007, but failed to meet the requirements and did not return the appeal until April 19, 2007. In addition, he did not show due diligence in filing his motion, failing to raise his claim until almost a year after the Board dismissed his appeal. Chen v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 267 (2d Cir. 2006).
 
*2 Further, to show ineffective assistance of counsel prejudice must be shown. Omar v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 647 (2d Cir. 2008). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004) (alien must show outcome might have been affected). The respondent has proffered no errors in the Immigration Judge’s decision which would demonstrate that the decision could have been reversed on appeal. Thus, he has not demonstrated prejudice from the failure of his former attorney to file an appeal. The filing of a post-conviction motion with the state court is not a ground for reopening a removal proceeding. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48); Matter of Marroquin, 23 I&N Dec. 705 (BIA 1997; A.G. 2005); Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894 (BIA 1994); see also Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750, 751-52 (BIA 1993).
 
The respondent claims he is not removable because his request to appeal his controlled substance conviction has been granted. There is no requirement that all appeals be exhausted before a conviction is final for immigration purposes. See Puello v. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, 511 F.3d 324 (2d Cir. 2007); see also Abiodun v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 1210 (10th Cir. 2006); Montenegro v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 1035 (7th Cir. 2004) (per curiam); Moosa v. INS, 171 F.3d 994 (5th Cir. 1999).
 
Insofar as the respondent argues he is not guilty of the crime of which he was convicted, the Board cannot go behind the conviction to determine guilt or innocence. Matter of Roberts, 20 I&N Dec. 294 (BIA 1991); Matter of Fortis, 14 I&N Dec. 576 (BIA 1974); see Matter of Mendez-Morales, 21 I&N Dec. 296 (BIA 1996); Matter of Reyes, 20 I&N Dec. 789 (BIA 1994). Likewise, matters involving state law are beyond the scope of our jurisdiction. The respondent must address his arguments to the state court. The respondent also argues he can apply for a waiver under former section 212(c) of the Act. The United States Supreme Court has held that the restrictions on section 212(c) relief do not apply retroactively to those aliens, who pled guilty to criminal offenses prior to April 24, 1996. See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). The respondent was convicted on February 28, 2006, and a waiver under former section 212(c) is not available to him. As the respondent is not eligible for discretionary relief, his long residence and family ties or hardship upon removal cannot be considered.
 
*3 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed. ORDER: The appeal will be dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lisa Dubowski, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (withdrawn)
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; adjustment of status
 
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on August 17, 2006, when we remanded the record of proceeding to the Immigration Judge for the issuance of a new decision in accordance with Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994). The Immigration Judge subsequently rendered a new decision on September 5, 2006, and the respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines, appeals from that decision presently. In support of the appeal, the respondent argues: (I) that the Immigration Judge’s September 5, 2006, decision fails identify and fully explain the reasons for the denial of the motion to reopen; and (2) that the Immigration Judge erroneously denied the motion to reopen because the ineffective assistance of the respondent’s prior counsel should have been invoked to equitably toll the time and numeric limitations on motions to reopen (Respondent’s Br. at 3-9). See generally, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (2008) (setting forth time and numeric limitations on motions to reopen filed before the Immigration Judge after entry of final administrative order). As we disagree on both counts, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
First, we find no merit to the respondent’s contention that the Immigration Judge’s decision is legally deficient because, as the respondent asserts, the Immigration Judge “adopted the ¿Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”)º rationale without further analysis (Respondent’s Br. at 2).” While certain portions of the Immigration Judge’s decision evidently draw upon the arguments offered in the DHS’s response in opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen filed on May 19, 2006, there is nothing in the Immigration and Nationality Act (“the Act”) or its attendant regulations that prevents the Immigration Judge from drawing upon the arguments offered by the parties to the proceeding in the course of reaching and articulating a decision. All that we require when an Immigration Judge renders a ruling on a motion to reopen is that the Immigration Judge “identify and fully explain the reasons for such decision,” and the Immigration Judge’s September 5, 2006, decision satisfies this basic adjudicative criterion. See Matter of M-P-, supra.
 
Second, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s arguments on appeal that the ineffective assistance of his prior counsel should be invoked to equitably toll the time and numeric limitations on motions to reopen. Indeed, we are not persuaded that the respondent’s prior counsel acted ineffectively. The respondent, represented by former counsel, filed the first motion to reopen on March 17, 2006, which, as the Immigration Judge correctly observed and the respondent does not contest, was 7 days after the expiration of the respondent’s voluntary departure period on March 10, 2 007 (I.J. at 1 (Sept. 5, 2006)). Rather than take an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 29, 2006, decision denying the first motion to reopen, the respondent retained present counsel of record and filed a second motion to reopen on May 9, 2006, which is both numerically and time-barred under the governing regulatory provision, a legal conclusion that the respondent also does not contest. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The purpose of both motions to reopen was to apply for adjustment of status pursuant to Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002) on the basis of a marriage to a United States citizen on December 19, 2005, which was 21 days prior to the entry of the final administrative order dated January 9, 2006, granting the respondent the privilege of voluntarily departing the United States on or before March 10, 2006 (I.J. at 1).
 
*2 We note that the Immigration Judge appropriately denied the respondent’s first motion to reopen because the respondent was ineligible to adjust his status as a result of his failure to voluntarily depart the United States before the expiration of the voluntary departure period. See section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c. Against this backdrop we turn to the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and we observe at the outset that such claims require, among other things, “that the motion to reopen be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard.” See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 603 (BIA 1996) (emphasis added) (citing Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988)). The substance of the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is that: (1) he retained the former counsel in December of 2005 to file a motion to reopen to enable him to apply for adjustment of status (Respondent’s M.T.R., Exhs. B, C (May 9, 2006)); (2) the respondent repeatedly contacted the former counsel concerning his case, and he was assured the motion to reopen was filed on time (Respondent’s M.T.R., Exhs. B, C (May 9, 2006)); and (3) “due to an error on ¿ the former counsel’sº part, the motion was not timely filed (Respondent’s M.T.R., exhs. B, C (May 9, 2006)).”
 
Such generalized, vague, and unsupported assertions are insufficient to establish any ineffectiveness on the part of the respondent’s former counsel, particularly so when they are scrutinized in light of the evidence in the record of proceeding. The respondent’s first motion to reopen contains 5 exhibits marked A through E, all of which except for exhibit E relate to the bona fides of the underlying marriage (Respondent’s M.T.R. (March 17, 2006)). As we examine these exhibits, it is evident to us that the respondent, and not respondent’s prior counsel, must bear the chief responsibility for whatever delay there may have been in properly filing the motion before the Immigration Judge. Bearing in mind that the respondent was married on December 19, 2005, we note the following. First, the Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, was not received by the DHS until January 25, 2006 (Respondent’s M.T.R., exh. B (March 17, 2006)). Second, exhibit C attached to the respondent’s motion to reopen contains an assortment of letters and a bank statement bearing dates ranging February 1 to 6, 2006 (Respondent’s M.T.R., exh. C (March 17, 2006)). Third, the sine qua non of the respondent’s first motion to reopen motion, the Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, shows that it was signed and dated by the respondent on March 1, 2006, and that it was apparently faxed to the respondent’s former counsel on March 2, 2006 (Respondent’s M.T.R., exh. D (March 17, 2006)). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(c) (providing that a motion to reopen filed for the purpose of applying for relief from removal must be accompanied by the requisite application). The respondent’s former counsel subsequently paid the required fee for the motion to reopen on the following day; however, the motion to reopen was not properly filed until March 17, 2006 (Respondent’s M.T.R. (March 17, 2006)). Thus, from this evidence it is clear to us that the respondent’s former counsel could only act as quickly as permitted by the respondent’s piecemeal manner of supplying him with the requisite evidentiary documents in support of the first motion to reopen. Although there is an unexplained 2-week gap between the date on which the filing fee was paid and the date on which the motion to reopen was actually filed, much of this elapsed time is irrelevant because the critical date here is March 10, 2006, the date on which the respondent’s voluntary departure period elapsed.
 
*3 Thus, in view of the fact that (1) the Immigration Judge has discretionary authority to establish time limits for the DHS’s reply to the respondent’s motion to reopen, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1)(iv); (2) the Immigration Judge allowed the DHS 10 days within which to reply to the respondent’s first motion to reopen as well as to the respondent’s second motion to reopen; and (3) the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s first motion to reopen 12 days after it was filed on March 29, 2006, and denied the respondent’s second motion on June 1, 2006, 22 days after it was filed, there is no basis upon which to presume that the motion would have been adjudicated before the expiration of the respondent’s voluntary departure period even had it been properly filed before March 10, 2006. See Chedad v. Gonzales, 497 F.3d 57, 64 (1st Cir. 2007) (“The relevant provisions of the act simply do not contemplate suspending the voluntary departure period so that aliens who have chosen that form of relief also can pursue reopening.”); see also Matter of Shaar, 21 I. & N. Dec. 541 (BIA 1996), aff’d, 141 F.3d 953 (9th Cir. 1998).
 
In conclusion, we reemphasize the importance of providing a detailed statement in support of the respondent’s ineffectiveness of counsel claim describing “the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard.” See Matter of Rivera, supra. In this case, the evidence submitted for the purpose of establishing the claimed ineffectiveness neither describes the terms according to which the work was to be performed nor how the former counsel’s performance of the work was ineffective. Hence, the respondent has failed to meet his burden of proving that reopening on the basis of his former counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness is warranted. See section 240(c)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4) (providing that an alien applying for relief from removal has the burden of establishing that he meets all applicable eligibility requirement for relief and that he merits a favorable act of discretion); accord 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). Thus, we need not reach the respondent’s equitable tolling argument. The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: SHAMSHER CHAGHANI
File: AXXX XX1 585 - Dallas, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raymond J. Sanders, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Judson J. Davis
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 The procedural posture of this case is as follows. At a sixth master calendar hearing held on April 20, 2004, the respondent, a native and citizen of Pakistan, conceded removability, agreed to voluntarily depart the United States on or before June 20, 2004, and waived his right to appeal. The respondent had been granted five continuances to afford the labor department time to adjudicate his pending labor certification. See Immigration Judge’s written decision issued June 30, 2004.
 
On June 15, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. He sought adjustment of status under former section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1255(i), based on his pending employment based immigrant visa petition (I-140). On January 24, 2005, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen.¿FN1º On July 8, 2005, and December 26, 2007, we denied the respondent’s first and second motions filed with this Board as being time and number barred. See sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § §1229a(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) (an alien may file one motion to reopen and, with certain exceptions not relevant here, it shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal).
 
On August 4, 2008, the respondent filed his third motion to reopen with this Board. Again, the respondent’s motion will be denied as time and number barred. A final administrative order was issued in this case over three years ago on January 24, 2005. The respondent asks us to reopen these proceedings on our own motion. This Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
First, he asserts that his due process rights were denied when the Immigration Judge failed to inform him of his right to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1255(i). The respondent’s argument is misplaced. The Immigration Judge granted the respondent five continuances so that the could obtain an approved labor certification, a prerequisite to adjustment of status. We observe that this record does not contain a copy of the respondent’s pre-April 30, 2001, labor certification allegedly filed by Prembro, Inc. on April 21, 2001. See Respondent’s Motion at 1.
 
*2 Second, the respondent asserts that these proceedings should be reopened because his waiver of his right to appeal was not knowing and voluntary. Contrary to the respondent’s assertions, he was granted voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), which does not require that an alien waive his right to appeal. See Immigration Judge’s written decision issued June 30, 2004. Insofar as the respondent blames his prior counsel for waiving his right to appeal, he has failed to comply with the requirements for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Also, equitable tolling of the 90-day motions deadline is not warranted here. In a recent unpublished case, the Fifth Circuit observed that an argument for equitable tolling “is in essence an argument that the BIA should have exercised its discretion to reopen the proceeding sua sponte based upon the doctrine of equitable tolling.” See Ben Jie Lin v. Mukasey, 2008 WL 2725317 (5th Cr. July 11, 2008). The respondent has not established exceptional circumstances warranting sua sponte reopening. See Matter of J-J-, supra.
 
Finally, the respondent asks that we reopen these proceedings based on the United States Supreme Court’s recent decision in Dada v. Mukasey, 128 S. Ct. 2307 (2008). In that case, the Supreme Court held that “… to safeguard the right to pursue a motion to reopen for voluntary departure recipients, the alien must be permitted to withdraw, unilaterally, a voluntary departure request before expiration of the departure period, without regard to the underlying merits of the motion to reopen. As a result, the alien has the option either to abide by the terms, and receive the agreed-upon benefits, of voluntary departure; or, alternatively, to forego those benefits and remain in the United States to pursue an administrative motion.” Id. at 2319.
 
In this case, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen for 245(i) adjustment with the Immigration Judge within the voluntary departure period. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on two grounds. First, the respondent’s motion was not supported by evidence showing his prima facie eligibility for 245(i) adjustment “if his I-140 application should ever be approved.” See Immigration Judge’s written decision issued June 30, 2004. Second, the respondent was barred from adjustment of status pursuant to section 240B(d) of the Act, based on his failure to depart as agreed. Because the respondent’s motion to reopen was not denied solely on the 240B(d) bar, Dada does not control this case. To date, regardless of the 240B(d) bar, the respondent has not established his prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status because the respondent has not established he is a grandfathered alien for 245(i) adjustment purposes. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.10. Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion is denied as time and number barred.
 
*3 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Royal F. Berg, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anastasie M. Senat
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s November 9, 2007, decision, denying her unopposed Motion to Rescind Removal Order. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for her failure to appear for the September 21, 2007, hearing. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded.
 
The respondent’s attorney of record admits that he failed to properly note or calendar the hearing. He further accepts complete responsibility for the respondent’s failure to appear for the hearing. Moreover, he has filed a bar complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities detailing his ineffective assistance. The respondent has submitted an affidavit on appeal indicating that her attorney failed to properly record the September 21, 2007, hearing in his calendar.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). In the case at bar, the respondent’s attorney has admitted that the respondent failed to appear at the hearing due to his failure to properly record the hearing date. We find that the respondent has presented a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and the proceedings will be reopened and remanded for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ryan Bausch, Esquire
*1 In a decision dated April 9, 2007, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent abandoned her request to file for the relief of cancellation of removal by failing to file an application by the deadline of March 9, 2007, and the respondent was ordered removed from the United States to Malawi. The respondent subsequently filed a motion to reopen on April 24, 2007, which was denied by the Immigration Judge on May 3, 2007. The respondent has appealed both the Immigration Judge’s initial decision dated April 9, 2007, and the Immigration Judge’s subsequent decision dated May 3, 2007, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen.¿FN1º The respondent requests acceptance of the first appeal by certification. We will accept the respondent’s first appeal by certification to avoid any question of untimeliness. The appeals will be consolidated and the records will be remanded.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred by denying her motion to reopen removal proceedings. She seeks reopening and remand to the Immigration Judge for consideration of newly discovered evidence. The respondent contends that her former attorney, Abdul Abdurahman, failed to file her application for cancellation of removal with the Immigration Court, although she completed the cancellation of removal application with Mr. Abdurahman on March 7, 2007, and she provided him with the application filing fee in January 2007. The respondent has submitted numerous documents in support of her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and in support of her application for cancellation of removal. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Furthermore, her current attorney of record has provided an affidavit concerning his own responsibility in the mishandling of the respondent’s case. The Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995).
 
In light of the respondent’s new allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel concerning her former attorney, Mr. Abdurahman, and the affidavit submitted by her current attorney regarding his responsibility in the mishandling of the respondent’s case, we find that the record must be remanded to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s claim that she failed to timely file her application for cancellation of removal due to ineffective assistance of counsel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). Accordingly, the appeals will be consolidated, and the records will be remanded.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeals are consolidated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The records are remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
 
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 1, 2007, decision. In that decision the Immigration Judge, inter alia, denied the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), as a matter of discretion. The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent to be statutoriJy ineligible for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of facts by an Immigration Judge, including those as to the credibility of testimony, to determine whether the findings are “clearly erroneous.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).¿FN1º The Board may review all questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues on appeal from decisions of the Immigration Judge “de novo.” 8 C.F.R. §1003.1(d)(3)(iii).
 
We first note that, while the respondent, in her Notice of Appeal (EOIR-26), initially raises a possible claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we will not consider this issue, the respondent having neither addressed the issue in her Brief, nor met any of the requirements we laid out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to support such a claim. Turning to the underlying issues, the respondent, who did not dispute any factual findings made by the Immigration Judge, asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her application as a matter of discretion. She asserts that, as she entered the United States in 1983 as a
 
After a determination is made that an alien is removable, and the alien seeks relief from removal which may be granted as a matter of discretion, the Immigration Judge is required to review the record as a whole. See Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581, 585 (BIA 1978). In weighing all of the favorable and adverse factors of record to determine whether cancellation should be granted as a matter of discretion, evidence of a respondent’s bad character or undesirability as a permanent resident of this country may be reviewed with appropriate weight, if any, given to such evidence. See Matter of Sotelo, 23 I&N Dec. 201 (BIA 2001); Matter of Marin, supra. The Immigration Judge met this requirement, considering all of those favorable factors, but nonetheless concluded that the serious adverse factors of record, including the respondent’s criminal activity, outweighed those favorable factors. In weighing the various factors, the Immigration Judge noted that, with respect to two shoplifting convictions, the respondent had demonstrated a complete lack of candor and forthrightness. Specifically, the Immigration Judge found that, while in both her application for cancellation as well as in her testimony on direct examination, she attempted to blame a shoplifting incident on her children, it became clear on cross examination that there were actually two shoplifting incidents, both of which were not only planned by the respondent, but in which she involved her young children. The Immigration Judge also found her immigration violations to be significant, incidents of smuggling aliens into the United States, in 2003 and again in 2004. The Immigration Judge properly considered these serious adverse factors in determining that a favorable exercise of discretion would not be in the best interest of the United States in this instance. We have similarly considered and weighed all of the favorable and adverse factors of record, and agree with the Immigration Judge that relief was not warranted in the exercise of discretion; we therefore affirm the decision for the reasons stated therein. See Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998); Matter of Marin, supra.
 
*2 Turning to the issue of the respondent’s eligibility for voluntary departure, in order to demonstrate statutory eligibility for the privilege of voluntary departure, one of the requirements the alien must meet is to show that he or she has been physically present in the United States for a period of at least 1 year immediately preceding the date the notice to appear was served under section 239(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a). See section 240B(b)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(1)(A).
 
The respondent in the instant case admitted the several allegations set out in the Notice to Appear, issued on December 1, 2003 (Exh. 1; Tr. at 1). She was charged as an arriving alien, and the third allegation was to the effect that on December 1, 2003, she had used the birth certificate of her United States citizen son to assist an alien to try to enter the United States in violation of law. As the respondent has not established that she had been physically present in the United States for a period of at least 1 year immediately preceding the date the notice to appear was issued, she is statutorUy ineligible for voluntary departure. See generally Matter of Romalez, 23 I&N Dec. 423 (BIA 2002); Matter of Arguellas, 22 I&N Dec. 811 (BIA 1999).
 
The following order shall be issued.

August 25, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rosaura Gonzalez Rucci, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rossana Rolon Grau
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen; reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision was dismissed in an order dated May 16, 2008. The respondent filed a motion to “reconsider” on June 13, 2008, which we also construe to be a motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision, and it shall be supported by pertinent authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). A motion to reconsider must assert that, at the time of our previous decision, an error was made. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
Since the respondent has not presented specific alleged errors of law or fact on the part of the Board in its prior order, the motion fails as one for reconsideration.
 
The respondent, through current counsel, argues that former counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. It is maintained that former counsel erred in admitting the respondent’s removability and asserting that he had no available relief from removal, when he “could have requested adjustment of status and a waiver of ¿hisº conviction.”
 
Although the motion to reopen technically is timely, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c), it is not explained why the respondent waited almost 2 years to complain about the quality of representation of former counsel before the Immigration Judge. Present counsel has been representing the respondent since November 13, 2006, the day the appeal was filed, and no mention of any alleged ineffective assistance was lodged on the appeal form or in a multi-page appellate brief filed by present counsel on October 15, 2007. The first allegation of ineffective assistance comes, curiously, only after a final order was rendered in this case.
 
Be that as it may, the respondent has failed to show that the outcome of this case would have been any different, had former counsel’s assistance been any different. An alien alleging ineffective assistance of counsel in proceedings must show that the proceedings were so fundamentally unfair that he or she was prevented from reasonably presenting his or her case. See, e.g., Wang v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 265 (1st Cir. 2004); Saakian v. INS, 252 F.2d 21 (1st Cir. 2001).
 
The record supported the conclusion that the respondent is removable as charged, and the respondent has submitted nothing with his motion to demonstrate otherwise. Further, the respondent has not shown that he is eligible for adjustment of status, a visa petition filed in his favor having been denied by a notice dated October 13, 2006, on the basis that he had engaged in a fraudulent marriage. Consequently, notwithstanding the respondent’s attempt to satisfy the requirements of our holding in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), in the absence of actual prejudice, there is no basis for reopening.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied, as is the request for a stay.

ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.¿FN1º We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s October 26, 2006, decision finding that the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) sustained its burden of establishing that the information in the respondent’s Form I-751 was not true and that the respondent had entered into a marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws. See section 216(c)(3)(D) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(3)(D); 8 C.F.R. § 1216.4(d)(2); see also Matter of Mendes, 20 I&N Dec. 833, 835 (BIA 1994); Matter of Lemhammad, 20 I&N Dec. 316 (BIA 1991). See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(h) (stating that the Board reviews questions of law de novo); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). Nor do we find clear error in the factual findings leading up to that determination. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (mandating that the Board “will accept the determination of factual issues by an immigration judge … unless the determination is clearly erroneous”). Notwithstanding the respondent’s assertions on appeal relating to the reliability of the information contained in the Notice of Termination and its supporting notes, the reliability of such documents was not objected to by respondent’s counsel when it was offered as evidence, although he clearly had an opportunity to do so (Tr. at 57; Exhs. 5, 6). Because we do not have a proper claim of ineffective assistance of counsel before us, we therefore find that the respondent is bound by his attorney’s failure to object to the admission of Exhibits 5 and 6. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986).
 
Moreover, the regulations specifically permit the Immigration Judge to receive in evidence any relevant and material, oral or written, statement previously made by the respondent or any other person during any investigation, examination, hearing, or trial. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.7. Introduction of the District Director’s Notice of Termination is, of course, also appropriate as the Immigration Judge, pursuant to section 216(c)(3)(D) of the Act, was required to “review” such determination. Furthermore, there has been no showing of specific disagreement with the accuracy of the interview as related in Exhibit 5, such as might necessitate an opportunity to cross-examine the interviewer. See, e.g., Baliza v. INS, 709 F.2d 1231 (9th Cir. 1983) (recognizing cross-examination not required where accuracy of affidavit not disputed); Marroquin-Manriquez v. INS, 699 F.2d 129 (3d Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1259 (1984) (recognizing that a respondent’s right to cross-examine witnesses is not absolute; it is circumscribed by the due process concept of reasonableness). The respondent raised no persuasive challenge to the authenticity or accuracy of Exhibits 5 and 6 as record of the interview. Thus, we conclude that admission and use of the notice was not fundamentally unfair. See, e.g., Baliza v. INS, supra;; Matter of Toro, 17 I&N Dec. 340 (BIA 1980); Matter of Ramirez- Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980); Matter of Lam, 141& N Dec. 168 (BIA 1972). Once admitted, the information contained in Exhibits 5 and 6 relating to the interview of the respondent and his spouse was clearly relevant and material. Significantly, as the Immigration Judge noted both the Notice of Termination and the respondent’s testimony reveal the existence of an intimate relationship with the mother of the respondent’s children at the time of the respondent’s initial involvement with and during the respondent’s involvement with his former spouse. We also reject the respondent’s contention that the Immigration Judge impermissibly focused on events that occurred after his marriage. Indeed, although the focus of this inquiry is on the intent of the parties at the time they entered into the marriage, see Matter of McKee, 17 I&N Dec. 332 (BIA 1980), the conduct of the parties after the marriage is relevant to their intent at the time of the marriage. See Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604 (1953). On this record, and on the facts as found by the Immigration Judge, we decline to set aside the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the DHS sustained its burden of establishing that the information in the I-751 was not true and that the respondent had entered into a marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws.
 
*2 Similarly, we find that the respondent’s assertion on appeal that the Immigration Judge improperly imposed his views about marriage onto the respondent is without merit. Under the circumstances, the Immigration Judge properly questioned the authenticity of the respondent’s marriage. Overall, the record reveals that the respondent received a full and fair hearing on the merits of his claim. He was represented by counsel and afforded the opportunity to present, examine, and object to evidence that affected his claim. Although the respondent appears to allege error, he has not on appeal specified such error or articulated or identified prejudice stemming from such errors. More importantly, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that the outcome of his case would have been different had the hearing been conducted in any other manner.
 
Finally, the respondent appeals the denial of voluntary departure. However, the Immigration Judge denied relief as a matter of discretion for the same reasons he relied upon in finding that the respondent had entered into a marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws, and we find no reason to disturb this determination. See Matter of Lemhammad, supra at 326.
 
On the whole, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s resolution. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated December 7, 2007. The respondent contends that his former representative afforded him ineffective assistance of counsel as he failed to contest the merits of the respondent’s denied I-715 petition. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argues that the respondent’s motion fails because the prior attorney made a strategy choice that does not amount to ineffective assistance. Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998).
 
A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). An alien must also show that the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case and that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that alien is prejudiced if attorney’s conduct may have affected the outcome of the proceeding); Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004); Matter of Assaad, supra. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the jurisdiction under which this case arises, has found, however, that aliens need not strictly adhere to the requirements of Matter of Lozada, especially when there is a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” See, e.g., Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
*2 Even if we were to find that the respondent sufficiently complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, we would nonetheless deny the respondent’s motion inasmuch as the respondent has not established prejudice. The respondent has not provided any evidence with the motion which indicates that the outcome of his appeal might have been different had the merits of the I-751 petition been argued. Moreover, the respondent failed to identify substantive arguments that he would have raised before the Immigration Judge regarding the bona fides of his marital relationship. Based upon this lack of proof, we are unable to find that the respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements for proving that he was prejudiced by his former attorney in these proceedings, and reopening is not warranted.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

Susan E. Hill, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lily C. Hsu
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was previously before us on December 21, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 30, 2007. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the in absentia order of removal entered on March 22, 2006, based on alleged “exceptional circumstances”on account of which the respondent claimed he failed to appear at the hearing held on March 22, 2006. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (2008). The respondent presently moves the Board to reconsider our initial decision pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). However, the respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.
 
Our decision dated December 21, 2007, was based in part upon the respondent’s failure to comply with the procedural prerequisites for a motion to reopen under a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Specifically, the respondent failed to support his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with any evidence showing that the individual accused of having provided ineffective legal assistance has been informed of the allegations against him. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592. 598-99 (9th Cir. 2004) (recognizing that purpose of the notice requirement is to allow prior counsel an opportunity to contest allegations of ineffectiveness so that the adjudicator can accurately assess the claim). In an effort to cure this defect, the respondent has included a declaration from the attorney who allegedly prepared and mailed the complaint to the individual accused of having provided ineffective legal assistance with the instant motion to reconsider.
 
However, the purpose of a motion to reopen is to state new facts to be proven at a prospective hearing date based on previously unavailable or undiscoverable evidence that indicates a meritorious claim for relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); Iturribarria v. IXS, 321 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir. 2003). A motion to reconsider, on the other hand, is intended to serve the separate purpose of providing the respondent with a procedural mechanism for “specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). That is, a motion to reopen provides a means for the introduction of new. relevant, and previously unavailable evidence into the record of proceeding, whereas a motion to reconsider is essentially just a request for further review of the record of proceeding in light of the factual and legal errors raised in the motion. Although the respondent has stylized the motion as a motion to reconsider, it is in substance a motion to reopen seeking consideration of new evidence, i.e., the declaration from the attorney who allegedly prepared and mailed the complaint to the individual accused of having provided ineffective legal assistance. Inasmuch, therefore, as the motion to reconsider fails to specify any errors of fact or law in our decision dated December 21, 2007, the motion to reconsider is denied on this basis. If we were to construe the motion as a motion to reopen, the motion would be denied on the grounds that: (1) the motion is numerically barred because the respondent may only file one motion to reopen after the Final administrative decision entered on March 22, 2006; and (2) the evidence offered was previously available to the respondent when he filed the motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge on December 4, 2006. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gary J. Yerman, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of China, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s April 3, 2007, decision denying her motion to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4) (2008). The appeal is dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent advances two principal arguments. First, the respondent contends that she has established “extraordinary circumstances” warranting equitable tolling of the time and numeric limitations on motions to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal in that she has filed a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against her former attorney (Respondent’s Br. at 5-7). See generally, Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Second, the respondent argues that she has established “changed country conditions arising in the country … to which removal has been ordered,” thereby excepting the motion to reopen from the time and numeric limitations to which such motions are customarily subject (Respondent’s Br. at 7-9). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i).
 
A motion to reopen filed in Immigration Court must generally be filed within 90 days of the entry of a final administrative order of removal, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), and the motion will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied that the evidence offered in the motion is material and not previously available or discoverable at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). A motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia order of removal based on “extraordinary circumstanced” must be filed within 180 days of the entry of the final administrative order. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). In addition, a motion to reopen filed for the purpose of submitting an application for asylum and related relief may be excepted from the time and numeric limitations if the motion establishes “changed country conditions arising in the country … to which removal has been ordered.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i).
 
In this case, the in absentia order of removal was entered against the respondent on September 10, 1999 (I.J. at 1 (April 3, 2007)). The respondent filed her first motion to reopen on January 24, 2000. The Immigration Judge denied that motion, and the Immigration Judge’s decision became a final administrative decision after the appeal period elapsed on February 23, 2000 (I.J. at 1-2 (April 3, 2007)). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39. The respondent subsequently filed a second motion to reopen on May 22, 2006 in which she advanced allegations substantially similar to those presently before us on appeal of ineffective assistance of counsel and of “changed country conditions” in China based on the alleged intensification of the enforcement of China’s coercive population control program. However, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s second motion to reopen on June 1, 2006, and, once again, that decision became a final administrative decision after the appeal period elapsed on July 1, 2006 (I.J. at 2 (April 3, 2007)). The respondent does not dispute that the present motion to reopen, filed on January 9, 2007, the third that she has filed, is subject to the time and numeric restrictions on motions to reopen.
 
*2 Turning first to the respondent’s claim that both the time and numeric limitations to which motions to reopen are subject should be tolled on account of the ineffectiveness of her former attorney, we disagree. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has recognized, the 180-day filing deadline for motions to reopen an in absentia order of removal is not subject to equitable tolling, under a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel or otherwise. See Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 1999) (“The ¿180-day filing periodº provision is jurisdictional and mandatory.”); see also Abdi v. Attorney General of the United States, 430 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir. 2005).
 
With respect to the respondent’s remaining claim of “changed country conditions arising in the country … to which removal has been ordered,” we note that the respondent’s claim is principally based on her decision to remain in the United States and give birth to several children after she had been ordered removed (Respondent’s M.T.R. (Exh. A) (Jan. 9, 2007)). However, we do not find that this constitutes a justifiable exception to the regulatory restrictions on motions to reopen in light of China’s coercive population control program. The birth of a second child constitutes changed personal circumstances, not “changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i); see also Zheng v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 869, 872 (8th Cir. 2007); Chen v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 758, 760-61 (7th Cir. 2007); Wang v. BIA, 437 F.3d 270, 273-74 (2d Cir. 2006); Zheng v. United States Department of Justice, 416 F.3d 129, 130 (2d Cir. 2005); Matter of C-W-L-, 24 I&N Dec. 346 (BIA 2007). Finally, we agree with the Immigration Judge for the reasons provided in his April 3, 2007, decision that the country conditions evidence submitted by the respondent failed to establish that conditions with respect to China’s coercive population control program have, in fact, changed (I.J. at 3-4 (April 3, 2007)). See generally, Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247 (BIA 2007); Matter of C-C-, 23 I&N Dec. 899 (BIA 2006). Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Virginia Carstens, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated July 24, 2007, dismissing the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision which found him removable and denied his application for adjustment of status. The respondent’s motion seeks to reopen for adjustment of status (based on an approved visa petition on his behalf by his United States citizen daughter) because of the alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel (Kevin Dehghani). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be granted because the respondent meets the requirements to allege ineffective assistance of counsel, shows prejudice, and shows due diligence so that equitable tolling of the time limitation on motions to reopen is warranted.
 
The facts and pertinent history of the case are as follows. The Immigration Judge issued his decision on January 27, 2006. The respondent appealed. The Board issued its decision on July 24, 2007. The respondent filed the present motion on March 19, 2008.
 
We find that the respondent meets the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA. 1988), to allege ineffective assistance of Mr. Dehghani. The respondent presents his affidavit;, present counsel’s letter to Mr. Dehghani, which gave him an opportunity to respond, and a complaint filed with the statewide bar counsel in East Hartford, Connecticut.
 
The Board held in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 561 (BIA 2003), that even if an alien meets the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, he or she must still show sufficient prejudice stemming from prior counsel’s actions. We find that the respondent shows sufficient prejudice. The respondent presents in support of his motion voluminous documentation to show the bona fides of his second marriage, which was at issue at the January 27, 2006, hearing. The respondent, through Mr. Dehghani, presented very little evidence regarding the marriage bona fides. Clearly the evidence now presented may have changed the outcome of the case.
 
The respondent also shows prejudice as regards the ground of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(6)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii) ¿falsely claiming United States citizenshipº. The respondent admitted using a false Puerto Rican identification card (Exh. 6), which stated that he was a United States citizen, to obtain a job. The respondent testified about this at the January 27, 2006, hearing, but the date the misrepresentation occurred was not brought up. See Tr. at 22-23, 26, 42-43. The respondent states in his affidavit that the misrepresentation occurred in 1994.¿FN1º This ground of inadmissibility (added by IIRIRA) only applies to representations made on or after September 30, 1996. The respondent thus makes a prima facie showing that the timing of the misrepresentation may have a bearing on the outcome of the case.
 
*2 We find that the respondent exercised due diligence in filing his motion to reopen. The Board issued its decision on July 24, 2007. The respondent met with and retained present counsel on August 13, 2007. The motion to reopen was filed on March 19, 2008, Ninety days from August 13, 2007 (when the respondent discovered that Mr. Dehghani provided ineffective assistance), was November 13, 2007. The period the respondent is asking us to toll runs from November 13, 2007, until March 19, 2008, which is 4 months and 1 week. We find that it is appropriate to equitably toll this time period. The respondent retained present counsel less than 3 weeks after the issuance of our July 24, 2007, decision. Although 4 months and I week is over the 90-day time limit for filing a motion to reopen, it is not excessively so given the actions which needed to be taken, including complying with the Lozada requirements and locating the documents the respondent presents which support the bona fides of his second marriage. See Jin Bo Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154, 159 (2d Cir. 2006) (finding that under the facts in the case, the motions period could be tolled for 5 months).
 
Accordingly, the motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

*1 This case was last before this Board on April 16, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s January 17, 2008, decision. In our decision, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). On June 19, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider and reopen our decision. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the respondent’s motion to reopen and reconsider. The respondent filed a response to the DHS’s opposition.¿FN1º The motion to reopen and reconsider will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider a decision must be filed with the Board within 30 days after the mailing of our decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The record indicates that on May 9, 2008, the respondent requested that we reissue our April 16, 2008, decision. The record also indicates that the respondent attempted to file a motion to reissue our decision on June 9, 2008, but that the motion was rejected for failure to include the required fee or fee waiver request form. On June 19, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and reconsider and requested that we reissue our decision alleging that he had not received a copy of it. The respondent has submitted a copy of an envelope sent by the Office of the Clerk of the Board of Immigration Appeals. The envelope indicates that it was returned to the sender. Inasmuch as it appears that the respondent did not receive a copy of our decision, another copy of our April 16, 2008, decision will be sent to the respondent and we will deem his motion to be timely filed.¿FN2º
 
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1), a motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority. The respondent claims that we lodged an additional charge of removability against him in our decision. We disagree. Our prior order merely reflects that an additional charge of removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), was lodged against the respondent during proceedings (Exh. 1A). The record indicates that the Immigration Judge did not find him removable on this basis and our order did not disturb that finding (Exh. 1A; Tr. at 20).
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he failed to establish extreme hardship to his United States citizen spouse or children. Our prior decision did not address the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he failed to establish extreme hardship to his wife or children because we found no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not merit relief as a matter of discretion. The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge and this Board erred in looking at his entire indictment, which included counts that were dismissed, to find that the respondent did not merit relief as a matter of discretion. We find no legal error in this examination for purposes of a discretionary determination and no legal error in the determination that the respondent does not merit relief as a matter of discretion.
 
*2 The respondent also requests that we reopen proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel. A motion to reopen must state the new facts to be proved and must be supported by evidentiary material. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). We have held that an alien must meet the “heavy burden” of showing that “if proceedings before the immigration judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence offered would likely change the result in the case.” Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992); see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 110 (1988) (stating that a motion to reopen is analogous to a motion for a new trial in a criminal case on the basis of newly discovered evidence and that the movant therefore faces a “heavy burden”). We note that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639, we held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the claim reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel also requires that the respondent establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his counsel’s ineffectiveness. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640.
 
The respondent contends that his prior attorney erred in failing to have him apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(b). However, inasmuch as the respondent conceded before the Immigration Judge that he was removable as charged under section 23 7(a)(2)(A)(ii)of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), the respondent is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act. See I.J. at 13; section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act (barring aliens convicted of an offense under section 237(a)(2) of the Act from eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act). Furthermore, a copy of a letter from the Alabama State Bar dated June 4, 2008, which the respondent submitted with his motion, provides that two attorneys from the Office of General Counsel of the Alabama State Bar reviewed the respondent’s complaint against his attorney and the attorney’s response. The letter explains that “in view of the nature and content of the complaint and the … response of the attorney¿,º” the Alabama State Bar decided to “take no further action in ¿theº matter.” The respondent also claims that evidence attached to his motion was not investigated by his prior counsel. However, the respondent has not made a prima facie showing that he suffered prejudice as a result of the failure to submit these documents. Based on the foregoing, we find that the respondent has not made a prima facie showing of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Matter of Coelho, supra. Based on the foregoing, we will deny the respondent’s request for reopening.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: A copy of the Board’s April 16, 2008, decision in this case will be reissued to the respondent.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
CERTIFICATION AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; removability
 
The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider our decision dated May 22, 2008, in which we summarily dismissed his untimely appeal from an Immigration Judge’s March 19, 2008, decision. The Board will grant the motion to reconsider, vacate our prior order, and exercise jurisdiction over the respondent’s appeal by certification. Upon consideration of the merits of the appeal, however, we will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
In our May 22, 2008, decision we noted that the Immigration Judge’s decision was mailed on March 19, 2008, the appeal was due at the Board on or before April 18, 2008, and the Notice of Appeal was filed on April 21, 2008. In this motion, the respondent acknowledges that the Notice of Appeal was filed in an untimely manner. He asserts, however, that the delay in filing was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent claims that his former attorney, who reserved appeal on his behalf, was aware of his intention to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision. Furthermore, he claims that he was confident that his attorney would file the appeal because when he attempted to hand her the Notice of Appeal forms, she informed him that she such forms in her office. Finally, he claims that when he contacted the attorney on April 17, 2008, she informed him that she did not file an appeal on his behalf.
 
To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must establish prejudice as well as substantial compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Iturribarria v. I.N.S., 321 F.3d 889, 899-900 (9th Cir. 2003). In this case, we find evidence of substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements. In light of the respondent’s claims, we also find that the respondent reasonably demonstrated to his attorney that he was interested in appealing the Immigration Judge’s decision. See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470(2000). Furthermore, in light of the respondent’s prompt submission of the Notice of Appeal within days of the deadline, we find that but for the attorney’s failure to file the appeal, the respondent would have filed an appeal in a timely manner. Id. In sum, the respondent has established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to his former attorney’s handling of the appeal.
 
*2 A motion to reconsider may be based on an allegation of material factual errors in the prior decision. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). In this case, although the respondent asserted in the Notice of Appeal that the attorney failed to file the appeal on his behalf, we did not consider the issue in reaching our decision to summarily dismiss the appeal. Inasmuch as we did not consider the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim in reaching our previous decision, we will vacate our prior order and accept jurisdiction over the appeal by certification. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c). Upon consideration of the merits of the appeal, however, we will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
During the removal hearings, the respondent, through counsel, conceded removability and applied for no forms of relief. Instead, he moved to continue the proceedings until after April 14, 2008, to enable him to pursue a collateral attack on the criminal conviction underlying the charges of removability. The Immigration Judge denied the continuance and ordered the respondent removable to Belize.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the crime for which his was convicted is not an aggravated felony, and that he is not removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).¿FN1º We disagree.
 
The respondent does not dispute that on January 13, 2006, he was convicted in the California Superior Court,County of San Bernardino, for the offense of possession or purchase of cocaine base in violation of section 11351.5 of the California Health and Safety Code. According to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this proceeding arises, a state drug offense qualifies as an aggravated felony for immigration purposes only if it would be punishable as a felony under federal drug laws, or if it contains a trafficking element. See Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, 382 F.3d 905, 910-(9th Cir. 2004). An offense is classified as a felony under the federal drug laws if it is punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding 1 year See 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(5); 21 U.S.C. § 802(44). The respondent’s offense, involving the possession of cocaine base for sale, is equivalent to the federal offense of possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Possession of less than 5 grams of cocaine base with intent to distribute is punishable under federal law by a term of imprisonment of up to 20 years, making it a federal felony. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C). Because the respondent’s offense is punishable as a felony under the federal drug laws, it qualifies as an aggravated felony in the Ninth Circuit. The respondent is, therefore, removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
*3 The following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s May 22, 2008, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert West, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julia C. Chimarusti
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated March 16, 2001. In that decision we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision concluding he was removable as charged and ineligible for any relief from removal, including cancellation of removal and a waiver under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C §1182(c). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.¿FN1º
 
As an initial matter, we address the question of our jurisdiction over the respondent’s motion. The respondent was deported from the United States on or about March 5, 2003, and illegally reentered on or about August 1, 2003. See Respondent’s Motion at 3.¿FN2º The respondent filed the present motion on February 5, 2008. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Reynoso-Cisneros v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1001 (holding that because the alien departed the United States after the completion of immigration proceedings, the Board had jurisdiction over the alien’s motion to reopen); see also Lin v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 979, 982 (9th Cir. 2007).¿FN3º
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent requests equitable tolling based on his claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel (Richard Fraade).¿FN4º See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating that the court recognizes equitable tolling of deadlines and numerical limits on motions to reopen or reconsider during periods when an alien is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and upheld in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). We conclude that equitable tolling is not warranted.
 
We find that the respondent has not substantially complied with the procedural prerequisites for alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent presents a copy of the bar complaint filed against Mr. Fraade which included an affidavit swearing to the contents of his complaint. Even if the affidavit can be construed as a separate declaration, there is no evidence that the respondent has notified Mr. Fraade of the allegations against him before the Board, and likewise no proof that he has been given an opportunity to respond to the allegations made against him to the Board. The respondent asserts that he has submitted emails to Mr. Fraade in this regard, but no such evidence has been submitted with the motion. See Respondent’s Motion at 6. Further, this is not a case where patent ineffective assistance has been shown which would excuse insufficient compliance with Lozada. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002). Therefore, based on insufficient compliance with Lozada, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not considered by the Board, and shall not be considered as a basis to toll the filing deadline for his motion. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 Assuming arguendo substantial compliance with Lozada, we conclude that the respondent does not show ineffective assistance of Mr. Fraade, and thus, does not show prejudice. See Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1046 (9th Cir. 2000) (stating that to show prejudice, the alien only need show plausible grounds for relief). The respondent claims that his former counsel failed to aggressively argue against the removal charge and to present a claim for cancellation of removal.
 
However, under the law as developed at the time of the Immigration Judge’s and Board’s decisions, the respondent’s conviction under Cal. Health & Safety Code § 11360(a) rendered him removable as charged under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º, to wit, an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B).¿FN5º See United States v. Lara-Aceves, 183 F.3d 1007 (9th Cir. 1999), United States v. Estrada-Torres, 179 F.3d 776 (9th Cir. 1999), and United States v. Lomas, 30 F.3d 1191 (9th Cir. 1994). These cases were collectively overruled on April 18, 2001, by United v. Rivera-Sanchez, 247 F.3d 905 (9th Cir. 2001), superseded by statute on other grounds (holding that § 11360(a) was facially too broad to be considered an aggravated felony in a Sentencing Guidelines context). Thus, that decision was issued after the final administrative order of removal was issued here. The respondent incorrectly asserts in his motion that “the Ninth Circuit had ruled on this issue prior to ¿hisº removal hearing.”. See Respondent’s Motion at 7. Thus, based on the applicable law as developed at the time the Board issued its March 16, 2001, decision, the respondent’s conviction qualified as an aggravated felony, which also rendered him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1229b(a)(3).¿FN6º As a result, his prior counsel’s assistance was not ineffective by failing to aggressively argue against the removal charge and for cancellation of removal.
 
We also find that the respondent does not show due diligence. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra, at 897 (stating that the alien must act with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). As noted above, United States v. Rivera-Sanchez was issued shortly after the Board’s dismissal of his appeal. The respondent does not explain the 7-year delay until February of 2008, to raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, e.g., based on failure to file a motion based on the change in law. Thus, the respondent has not shown due diligence in bringing his ineffective assistance claim.
 
*3 Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied as untimely, and the respondent has not established a basis for equitable tolling of the filing deadline.
 
The respondent argues in the alternative that the Board should exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen the proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999) (fundamental change in law may warrant sua sponte reopening notwithstanding otherwise applicable time and number limitations on motions); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (Board will exercise its sua sponte authority over an untimely motion only in an “exceptional situation”). The Board declines to sua sponte reopen these proceedings.
 
The respondent’s arguments in favor of sua sponte reopening are not clear, as he cites to the “Corona Rivera decision” with no citation, as a fundamental change in law. See Respondent’s “Reply to ICE Opposition.” We surmise that the respondent intended to cite to United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, supra. The change in law represented by Rivera-Sanchez predates the respondent’s motion by nearly 7 years. The respondent has not shown due diligence by promptly seeking reopening based on that change in law. Consequently, the interest of finality in immigration proceedings takes precedence. See, e.g., Matter of G-C-L-, 23 I&N Dec. 359 (BIA 2002) (setting forth reasons for no longer sua sponte reopening cases where more than 5 years had passed from a fundamental change in law). Further, the respondent has offered no evidence establishing that his conviction was not for an aggravated felony. Although the burden is on the DHS to establish an alien’s removal under section 237 of the Act, as an alien seeking sua sponte reopening, we find it appropriate to place the burden on the respondent to submit evidence establishing that his conviction involved conduct which would not qualify as an aggravated felony. The respondent has not submitted such evidence. Thus, as an exceptional situation has not been shown, the Board finds insufficient cause to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

The respondent submitted with his motion a copy of a court document purportedly dismissing an indictment against him for illegal reentry after deportation. The basis for the dismissal claims that there may have been “a possible legal problem with the defendant’s removal proceedings.” Contrary to the respondent’s assertions in his motion, he has submitted no evidence that any court has found a legal error in his removal proceedings.

2

The respondent appears to state that he was removed a second time, and perhaps reentered again subsequently; however, the record is not clear and the DHS has not submitted any evidence in this regard. See Respondent’s Motion at 4.

3

The DHS has not informed the Board whether it has reinstated a prior removal order pursuant to section 241(a)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5), and 8 C.F.R. § 241.8. See Lin v. Gonzales, supra, at 982.

4

The respondent also claims ineffective assistance of William C. Carrico, Assistant Federal Public Defender. This claim is not properly before the Board as the respondent has not shown that Mr. Carrico represented him before the Immigration Judge or the Board.

5

The respondent incorrectly asserts that he was also found removable “as an alien convicted of a narcotics offense ….” Respondent’s Motion at 2. It is noted that the DHS repeated the same incorrect information in its opposition. The single removal charge was under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act (Exh. 1).

6

As affirmed in the Board’s March 16, 2001, decision, the respondent was also ineligible for a waiver under section 212(c), and no change in law affects this determination.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Riddhi Desai, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Gerrie Zhang
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated February 19, 2008. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision which denied his motion to reopen which sought to reopen his removal proceedings on the basis of ineffective assistance of former counsel (John Mendoza). The respondent’s motion is both time and number barred. The motion will be denied because the respondent does not show sufficient prejudice, so exercise of our sua sponte authority is not warranted.
 
The facts and pertinent history of the case are as follows. The Notice to Appear (Form I-862) was issued on August 21, 2004. The respondent was first represented by attorney Maribel Roldan. On March 16, 2005, Ms. Roldan moved for a change of venue on the respondent’s behalf and also moved for withdrawal as counsel, and noted the respondent was in agreement with both motions. Ms. Roldan stated that the respondent was eligible for asylum and withholding of removal. The respondent was next represented by attorney John Mendoza. In a June 5, 2006, order the Immigration Judge granted the respondent 120 days voluntary departure and the parties waived appeal. The respondent was next represented by attorney Brian Bates, who filed a motion to reopen on September 6, 2006, which alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel Mendoza and submitted the respondent’s asylum application. The Immigration Judge denied the motion as untimely. The respondent appealed and the Board dismissed the appeal in a February 19, 2008, decision (the respondent was represented on appeal by attorney J. Jesus Rios). The present motion to reopen was filed on May 19, 2008.
 
In the respondent’s present motion he alleges ineffective assistance of former counsels Bates and Rios. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (in whose jurisdiction the present case arises) does not have to date any published decisions on equitable tolling of the time and number limits for motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The Fifth Circuit has recognized and approved of our decisions in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the requirements to allege ineffective assistance of counsel) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (the alien must also show that former counsel’s actions were prejudicial to his case). See Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 164-65 (5th Cir. 2006) (stating the Board has determined that ineffective assistance of counsel is a valid ground for reopening, in egregious circumstances, and when prejudice is shown). We will thus consider whether the respondent’s motion merits exercise of our sua sponte authority. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (Board’s discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”).
 
*2 We find that the respondent meets the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, to allege ineffective assistance of former counsels Bates and Rios. The respondent has filed a detailed affidavit, present counsel’s letters to Mr. Bates and Mr. Rios, the response of Mr. Bates, and two bar complaints.
 
The Board held in Matter of Assaad, supra, at 561, that even if an alien meets the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, he or she must still show sufficient prejudice stemming from prior counsel’s actions. We find that the respondent does not show sufficient prejudice. The respondent claims that the ineffective assistance of former counsels Mendoza, Bates, and Rios combined to prevent him from timely filing for asylum and withholding of removal. The respondent, however, has never alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel Roldan. Ms. Roldan mentioned that the respondent was eligible for asylum and withholding of removal in the respondent’s motion for change of venue and her motion for withdrawal and noted the respondent was in agreement with both motions. The respondent was thus aware of the availability of applying for asylum and withholding of removal on or before March 16, 2005 (when the motion was filed), and cannot rely on the claimed ineffective assistance of succeeding former counsels for his failure to timely apply for asylum and withholding. We thus decline to exercise our sua sponte authority. See Matter of G-D-, supra.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cori White
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on May 30, 2008, when it affirmed the Immigration Judge’s February 26, 2008, decision denying the respondent’s application for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). The respondent has filed a timely motion for “reconsideration,”¿FN1º and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition. The motion will be denied. The request for a waiver of filing fees is granted. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a)(1), 1003.8.
 
In its May 2008 decision, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal because he had failed to show that he was actually prejudiced by his former counsel’s failure to successfully challenge a change in venue in his removal proceedings from San Pedro, California, to San Antonio, Texas. The Board also concluded that the respondent had not met the procedural requirements for establishing that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383 (5th Cir. 2001); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
With his motion, the respondent has submitted documentation that he filed a complaint against his former counsel with the State Bar of California in April 2008 (which concluded in May 2008 that the matter did not warrant action). The respondent also submitted a copy of a March 2008 letter he received from his former counsel, although this document had already been submitted to and considered by the Board prior to its May 2008 decision. It is still questionable whether the respondent has detailed the agreement he entered into with his former counsel, although this is alluded to somewhat in the text of his motion (Motion at 3-4).
 
In any case, the respondent has still failed to show how he was actually prejudiced by the alleged failure of his former counsel to contest the change of venue from San Pedro to San Antonio. Although the venue change conceivably could have made it more difficult for witnesses favorable to the respondent to testify in person, he has not shown that the venue change prevented these individuals from testifying by telephone or from submitting affidavits or letters in his support. Indeed, he has not submitted (with his motion) any affidavits or letters from these individuals confirming what their testimony would have been.
 
The respondent also argues in his motion that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to allow the respondent’s former counsel to withdraw from representing the respondent following the venue change (Motion at 3). However, the respondent still has not shown how he was actually prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s actions (i.e., how the withdrawal of his former counsel and the appointment of a new counsel would have potentially altered the outcome of these proceedings). See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent styled his motion as one for “reconsideration.” However, because the intent of the motion was essentially to introduce new evidence to the Board, it is more akin to a motion to reopen, and thus will be treated as such. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard Mendez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Delia I. Gonzalez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s written decision dated May 31, 2007, which denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his administratively final deportation proceedings. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
The respondent cites to precedent decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in support of his arguments that he received inadequate notice of his deportation proceedings, and that the entry of an in absentia order of deportation therefore violated his due process rights. However, the respondent’s motion arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and he provides no controlling legal authority in support of the foregoing arguments. See generally Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25 (BIA 1989) (providing that the Board follows circuit precedent in cases arising in that circuit). Thus, despite the respondent’s appellate contentions, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to establish that his failure to appear at his deportation hearing was caused by a lack of notice of such hearing. In particular, the respondent’s claim that he received inadequate notice of his deportation hearing in light of his age is unavailing, as he was over 14 years old when he received his Order to Show Cause. See I.J. (written decision dated May 31, 2007) at 1; Exhs. 1A, 4A. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 242.3 (1989 version) (providing that an Order to Show Cause could not be served on a minor under the age of 14) (emphasis added).
 
Moreover, as the Immigration Judge noted, despite the respondent’s claim that he was “not made aware” of his obligations to appear in Immigration Court, the Order to Show Cause was personally served on the respondent. See I.J. (written decision dated May 31, 2007) at 1-2; Exh. 1A. Furthermore, several documents warning him, in Spanish, of his obligation to keep the Immigration Court and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (the predecessor to the Department of Homeland Security) apprised of his current address were personally served on the respondent. See Exhs. 2B-2C.
 
As the Immigration Judge observed, the hearing notices relating to the respondent’s deportation proceedings were properly addressed to the last address provided by the respondent when he was warned of the address reporting requirements, and the respondent does not claim that the hearing notices failed to be delivered to such location. See I.J. (written decision dated May 31, 2007) at 1-2. Based on the foregoing, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to establish that he was not provided with proper notice of his deportation hearings. The Immigration Judge therefore correctly declined to reopen the respondent’s deportation proceedings based on the respondent’s claim of inadequate notice.
 
*2 The respondent also contends that he is eligible for relief from deportation for which he was ineligible at the time he was ordered deported. An alien is not required to rescind his or her deportation order under former section 242B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b, if he or she is pursuing an application for new relief, and provided that there is no evidence that the respondent received the required warnings under former section 242B(e) of the Act. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). Rather, the motion to reopen is only subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b). Under these standards, the respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s decision, and after September 30, 1996. The respondent is consequently precluded from having his motion considered under the general time limitations for a motion to reopen.¿FN1º Furthermore, we are unpersuaded by the respondent’s contentions that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled under Ninth Circuit precedent or that the untimeliness of his motion should be excused due to his ignorance of the filing deadlines. Likewise, although the respondent suggests that the untimeliness of his motion to reopen was the result of ineffective assistance of prior counsel, he has failed to satisfy any of the procedural requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). As the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and the respondent has not demonstrated that his motion is exempt from the general time limitations, we find that the Immigration Judge was correct in denying the respondent’s motion based on the respondent’s alternate request for reopening pursuant to Matter of M-S-, supra. See I.J. (written decision dated May 31, 2007) at 2.
 
Finally, although the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge failed to provide a reasoned analysis for the denial of his motion to reopen as required by Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002), we find that the Immigration Judge’s decision adequately identifies and explains the reasons for denying the respondent’s motion. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

File: AXX XX4 840 - El Paso, TX
July 15, 2008
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lynn Olinger, Esquire
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R, § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the pending motion, which will be granted.
 
On March 26, 1991, this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 5, 1990, in absentia decision, and denied the respondent’s motion to remand the record for failure to establish reasonable cause for his failure to appear at the hearing. On April 4, 1997, we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen for adjustment of status, and on July 29, 1998, we denied his second motion to reopen proceedings for adjustment of status, asylum, suspension of deportation, and withholding of deportation. The respondent has now filed his third motion to reopen proceedings, wherein he currently requests relief from deportation and argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel before the Immigration Judge and this Board.
 
Initially, we agree with the respondent’s argument that he is unaffected by numerical and timeliness requirements due to the date of his Order to Show Cause (OSC). In our precedent decision Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155 (BIA 1999), we recognized that the former regulation set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii) imposes no time or numerical limitation on aliens seeking to reopen deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act. Accordingly, our prior 1998 decision, finding his second motion to reopen barred under 8 C.F.R § 1003.2(c)(2), was incorrect. However, we do note that while the respondent currently argues that the Board erred in that 1998 decision because the respondent presented prima facie evidence that “he never received notice of his 1990 hearing,” we note that his 1998 motion requested a remand to apply for adjustment of status and did not address his 1990 in absentia hearing.
 
Nonetheless, the respondent now requests that he be excepted from these timeliness and numerical limitations because he received ineffective assistance of counsel and, again, because of the application of 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii). The respondent argues that his representative had been disbarred 7 years prior to his representation of the respondent, and that he did not, inter alia, properly address the in absentia issue which is postured herein. Moreover, the respondent also appears to argue that his representative’s firm did not properly advise him of the date and time for his hearing. Given our previous error in finding the respondent barred by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), and given the respondent’s current compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), we will grant the respondent’s motion, and remand the record for further proceedings regarding the respondent’s requests for relief. The following orders will, thus, be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

IN RE: RUZDI KRKUTI
File: AXX XX4 511 - El Paso, TX
July 14, 2008
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael P. DiRaimondo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William M. Hunt
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 11, 2008, denying his motion to reopen deportation proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed in part and sustained in part; the record will be remanded.
 
Upon review of the record, we adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge, except with regard to the order of deportation. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 3994). In reaching this conclusion, we find that the Immigration Judge properly denied the motion as untimely, as the motion was filed nearly 24 years after the respondent agreed to a stipulated order of deportation, and well-after the regulatory deadlines for motions to reopen provided under 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), 1003.43. Although the respondent presents sympathetic circumstances, he has neither demonstrated that he qualifies for an exception to the statutory and regulatory filing deadlines nor set forth circumstances that would justify equitable tolling of this lengthy period. He has not detailed a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, nor met the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Further, the respondent has failed to establish diligence. See, e.g., Baldwin County Welcome Center v. Brown, 466 U.S. 147, 151 (1984) (requiring diligence for invocation of equitable tolling); Galayr v. INS, 196 F.3d 1257 (5th Cir. 1999).
 
Given the record before the Immigration Judge, we cannot find that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion in declining to reopen proceedings sua sponte, and we likewise find that the circumstances presented by the respondent do not warrant the exercise of our limited discretion to reopen sua sponte. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (“the power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”).
 
The respondent also asserts that the Immigration Judge erred by failing to explore his eligibility for adjustment of status. The fact that the respondent may have become eligible for this relief after the time limitation on motions to reopen had expired does not excuse the untimeliness of his motion. Moreover, even if the respondent’s motion were timely, the respondent was not prima facie eligible for adjustment of status because there was no immigrant visa is immediately available to him. See sections 201(b)(2)(A)(i), 203, 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1151(b)(2)(A)(i), 1153, 1255(a); Matter of Garcia, 16 I&N Dec. 653, 657 (BIA 1978).¿FN1º
 
*2 In addition, the respondent claims that the Immigration Judge erred in holding that the fact that Yugoslavia, the country designated in the 1984 Order of Deportation, no longer exists is a matter for the Department of Homeland Security to resolve (Respondent’s Brief at 5-6). An alien who has been ordered removed may designate one country to which he wants to be removed and the Attorney General shall remove the alien to the country the alien so designates. See, e.g., section 241(b), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b). Although the respondent was provided with an opportunity to designate Yugoslavia in 1984, given the passage of time and the changes to the country since his designation we find it appropriate to remand the record for the sole purpose of providing the respondent the opportunity to designate a country of removal.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed and the request for a stay of deportation is denied
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for the sole purpose of allowing the respondent the opportunity to designate a country of removal.

We note that the respondent is seeking the opportunity to pursue adjustment of status. Adjustment of status is an extraordinary form of relief that was not designed to supersede the regular consular process of visa issuance abroad, and which may be granted only where a favorable exercise of discretion is shown to be warranted. See Matter of Bias, 15 I&N Dec. 626, 630 (BIA 1974; A.G. 1976); Matter of Arai, 13 I&N Dec. 494 (BIA 1970). Although we decline to express an opinion on the likelihood of the respondent’s success in such efforts, once abroad he may seek relief from the regular consular process, including any applicable waivers.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ralph A. Horton, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carla J. Hengerer
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 21, 2008, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States, following the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing on December 21, 2007. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, finding that a notice of hearing was sent to the respondent’s counsel on July 31, 2007, which constitutes more than adequate time for the respondent to have become apprised of the court date.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that he did not receive written notice of the hearing at his home address, nor did his attorney advise him of the new hearing date. The respondent indicates that he was unaware of the in absentia removal order until he was taken into custody. In support of his motion to reopen, the respondent submitted a declaration and an attorney affirmation from his counsel of record, Ralph A. Horton, Equire. The respondent asserts in his declaration that the Immigration Judge is aware that his representative failed to act accordingly and his ineffectiveness affected him. In an attorney affirmation dated February 14, 2008, Mr. Horton states that he is at a loss to explain how this matter came to the point of both he and the respondent missing the December 27, 2007, hearing date.¿FN1º He further explains that his younger brother died suddenly in October 2007, and consequently, his attention to work suffered and he became substantially behind in attending to clients’ affairs, thereby missing the notice of hearing pertaining to the respondent.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent’s attorney has admitted that he became substantially behind in attending to his clients’ affairs due to a sudden death in his family, and he missed the notice of hearing for the respondent. Moreover, the record reflects that the notice of hearing was sent only to Mr, Horton, and the respondent submitted a declaration stating that he never received notice of the hearing from the Immigration Court or his attorney. We find that the respondent has presented a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Alrefae v. Chertoff, 471 F.3d 353 (2d Cir. 2006) (court determined that IJ erred in rejecting alien’s claim of nonreceipt by failing to explain why alien hadn’t rebutted the presumption of receipt; IJ erred by not analyzing alien’s claim of exceptional circumstances independently of his claim of nonreceipt; and IJ failed to provide any explanation for his conclusion that alien failed to establish prima facie eligibility for reopening). We note further that the requirement that a bar complaint be filed is to ensure that collusion does not occur, and that the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a valid one. See Matter of Lozada, supra. Therefore, as we find that counsel did afford the respondent ineffective assistance and in light of the lack of any bar complaint, we shall forward this matter to the Executive Office for Immigration Review Bar counsel for review and the institution of any disciplinary measures deemed appropriate. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

Micheal K. Mehr, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ozlem B. Barnard, Esquire
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on January 16, 2008, when we dismissed without opinion the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 22, 2006. The respondent presently requests that we reconsider our January 16, 2008, decision under a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel.¿FN1º However, because we conclude that the respondent has failed to (1) establish that the 30-day filing deadline should be equitably tolled and (2) satisfactorily comply with the procedural requirements by which motions to reconsider under a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel are governed, the respondent’s motion will be denied. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). In addition, the respondent’s request for a stay of removal will be correspondingly denied as moot. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(f).
 
Turning first to the equitable tolling issue, the respondent filed the presumptively time-barred motion to reconsider (accompanied by the motion for stay of removal) on March 14, 2008. However, the respondent argues that he meets the legal requirements necessary to equitably toll the 30-day filing deadline by which his otherwise untimely motion to reconsider is barred. See, e.g., Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999) (applying equitable tolling doctrine to 90-day filing period for motions to reopen where alien is prevented by his legal representative’s fraud from filing motion timely). We disagree.
 
In Lopez v. INS, supra., the Ninth Circuit recognized that the 90-day filing deadline applicable to motions to reopen may be equitably tolled where the respondent establishes that he has been prevented from meeting the 90-day deadline by “fraudulent legal representation” of which he remains ignorant “without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part.” Lopez v. INS, supra., at 1100 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the respondent contends that his former counsel’s statement in a letter dated January 18, 2008, that our decision dated January 16, 2008, is “final” and that he is “not eligible to appeal” our decision rises to the level of fraudulent legal representation (Respondent’s Mot. To Recon. Exh. A).
 
We conclude that former counsel’s statements do not constitute fraudulent legal representation because they were correct as a matter of law when they were made. First, our decision dated January 16, 2008, is a final administrative order or removal. See section 242(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a). Second, the respondent’s former counsel was correct in advising the respondent that he was “not eligible to appeal” our decision or, in actual fact, the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 22, 2006, because the Act has expressly foreclosed from judicial review discretionary determinations, such as the one rendered by the Immigration Judge (and affirmed without further opinion by us) denying the respondent’s request for relief from removal under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1994), on discretionary grounds. See section 242(a)(2)(B)(ii), (C) of the Act; Fernandez v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 592, 596 (9th Cir. 2006). Thus, we conclude that the respondent’s motion for reconsideration is time-barred and not subject to equitable tolling.
 
*2 Even were the respondent’s motion for reconsideration timely filed, the motion also fails to comply with the procedural requirements by which motions to reconsider under a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel are governed.¿FN2º In Matter of Lozada, supra, we set forth the elementary procedural requirements for a facially cognizable motion to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The first among them is the requirement that “the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard.” Id. at 637 (emphasis added).
 
In this case, the respondent’s declaration attached to the motion to reconsider fails to describe with sufficient detail the “agreement that was entered into with counsel.” Specifically, the respondent’s declaration only reflects that the respondent retained his former counsel in October of 2004 to represent him during the removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge, and that she “represented ¿the respondentº in an appeal before the Board of Immigration Appeals (Respondent’s Mot. To Recon. Exh. B).”¿FN3º Thus, the respondent has failed to establish that his former counsel’s representation of him before us extended beyond filing the Notice of Appeal, submitting a brief or written statement in accordance with the established briefing schedule, and apprising the respondent of the issuance of our decision, all of which the respondent’s former counsel evidently did in accordance with their agreement. The respondent, in short, has failed to establish that the agreement he entered into with his former counsel provided for any legal representation after our adjudication of the respondent’s appeal. Further, we note that former counsel’s letter to the respondent dated January 18, 2008, invited the respondent to contact former counsel in the event he wished to make any further inquiries of his case (Respondent’s Mot. To Recon. Exh. A). The respondent evidently declined the invitation to do so (Respondent’s Mot. To Recon. Exh. B). Accordingly, we conclude that the respondent has failed to establish that his former counsel acted ineffectively.¿FN4º Thus, the following orders will be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion for reconsideration is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s request for stay of removal is denied as moot.

In evident acknowledgment of his motion to reconsider’s untimeliness, the respondent simultaneously filed a motion to reopen the record of proceedings on March 14, 2008. However, the purpose of a motion to reopen is to state new facts to be proven at a prospective hearing date based on previously unavailable or undiscoverable evidence that indicates a meritorious claim for relief from removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) (2008); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir. 2003). Here the respondent argues that the intervening decision published by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Camins v. Gonzales, 500 F.3d 872 (9th Cir. 2007), has rendered our decision dated January 16, 2008, legally erroneous. Thus, the respondent requests reconsideration of our earlier decision, not reopening for the purpose of submitting new, previously unavailable evidence or new applications for relief from removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied because the respondent seeks reconsideration of our prior decision in light of an alleged change in the law subsequent to the issuance of the final administrative order of removal in this case. Further, the respondent’s motion to reopen is also defective due to its failure to comply with the basic regulatory requirement that the motion be supported by new, previously unavailable evidence or new applications for relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).

We are mindful that the Ninth Circuit has provided for a limited number of circumstances under which it will not respect our strict adherence to the procedural prerequisites for a motion to reopen or reconsider under a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 938 (9th Cir. 2003) (excusing alien’s failure to lodge a complaint with the appropriate state disciplinary authorities where alien offered a reasonable excuse for this omission and there was no suggestion of collusion between the alien and former counsel); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002) (dispensing with the Lozada requirements where counsel’s ineffective assistance was obvious and undisputed on the face of the record); Ontiveros-Lopez v. INS, 213 F.3d 1121, 1124-25 (9th Cir. 2000) (concluding that “arbitrary application” of the Lozada requirement is not warranted if alien shows “diligent efforts” to comply were unsuccessful due to factors beyond his control). However, we do not find that any of the circumstances requiring relaxation of the Lozada requirements within the territorial jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit is present in this case. It is fundamental to establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that the respondent show that his former counsel’s conduct ran afoul of an agreement for specific legal representation, and the respondent has failed to satisfactorily make such a showing. That is, the respondent has not provided sufficient evidence to establish that the filing of either post-decision motions with us after we issued the final administrative order of removal on January 16, 2008, or a petition for review with the Ninth Circuit was within the scope of the respondent’s agreement with his former counsel.

3

We observe, with respect to the insufficiency of the respondent’s evidence in this regard, that the respondent has failed to either (1) support the motion for reconsideration with a copy of the fee agreement(s) he entered into with his former counsel or (2) provide any explanation for his inability to do so.

4

We note in closing that Camins v. Gonzales, supra, was published on August 28, 2007, over six months after the respondent, acting through his former counsel, filed the appellate brief in this case. In the absence of evidence showing that the parameters of the agreement entered into between the respondent and his former counsel included the filing of supplemental briefs, post-decision motions, or a petition for review to the Ninth Circuit, however, we are unable to conclude and unwilling to presume that it did.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John E. MacDonald, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on April 22, 2008, on a motion to reconsider, at which time we vacated our prior November 30, 2007, order denying the respondent’s motion to reopen for ineffective assistance of counsel, and found that while the respondent was technically eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(h) of the Act on a nunc pro tunc basis, the respondent still had failed to demonstrate a sufficient basis to afford the respondent nunc pro tunc relief Accordingly, we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our previous denial of his motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has now filed a motion to reconsider our April 22, 2008, decision, arguing that we erred in considering issues of fact which should have been properly remanded to the Immigration Court. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent’s motion to reconsider is barred by regulation. A party may not seek reconsideration of a decision which denied a previous motion to reconsider. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). Herein, the respondent requests that we reconsider our previous April 22, 2008, denial of his motion to reconsider our November 30, 2007, decision. However, due to the unique posture of the case, in which we vacated, in part, the November 30, 2007, decision, we will also address the merits of his decision. In short, the respondent argues that the Board erred in our previous decision by finding that he was entitled to consideration of his waiver of inadmissibility on a nunc pro tunc basis. Specifically, we held that, in accordance with Matter of Balao, 20 I&N Dec. 440 (BIA 1992), the respondent had not demonstrated that he had departed and returned to the United States since the time of his 1980 conviction; moreover, we found that his delay in receiving a grant of his Form I-130 petition was not an error justifying nunc pro tunc consideration. See generally Fierro v. Reno, 217 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2000). The respondent now argues that he did, indeed, depart the United States subsequent to his 1980 conviction, and he further argues that the delay in the adjudication of his Form I-130 is a finding of fact which should be addressed, in the first instance, by the Immigration Judge.
 
Generally, a motion to reopen will not be granted unless it states new and material facts, is supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material, and establishes a prima facie case of statutory AXX XXX XXX and discretionary eligibility for the underlying substantive relief sought. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992); 8 CF.R. §§ 1003.2 and 1003.8. In the case of claims under the standards set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), an alien must demonstrate at least prima facie evidence that the outcome of the case would have been different if he had been represented by adequate counsel. We find, in the instant case, that the respondent simply did not demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief so as to demonstrate prejudice in his initial November 30, 2007, ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The respondent now argues that he had no idea that his departure and reentry into the United States was “relevant” until our April 22, 2008, decision; however, it is he who raised the issue of nunc pro tunc availability and should have been aware of the law set forth in Matter of Balao, supra, and Matter of Parodi, 17 I&N Dec. 608 (BIA 1980). Similarly, the respondent did not present a modicum of evidence that error or bad faith existed in the timing of his Form I-130 approval, but argues only that this issue should be explored at the Immigration Court level. Inasmuch as the respondent carries the burden of demonstrating that a motion to reopen is warranted, we find no error in our previous decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reconsider. Accordingly, inasmuch as the respondent does not identify specific error in our prior order, or call our attention to a change of law stated or relied upon in our earlier decision, the motion is denied. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.2; see Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991).

IN RE: MARWAN HACHEM, BENEFICIARY OF A VISA PETITION FILED BY TIFFANY SHARNELL JACKSON, PETITIONER
File: AXX XX6 587 - Santa Ana, CA
July 2, 2008
 
IN VISA PETITION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER:
 
Joshua Effron, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cathy Lin
Associate Regional Counsel
*1 The petitioner has appealed from a February 28, 2007, District Director’s (hereinafter, “director”) decision denying the visa petition she submitted on behalf of the beneficiary as her spouse. The District Director cited the lack of evidence the petitioner and beneficiary had shared a joint life in denying the petition. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
In visa petition proceedings, the petitioner has the burden of establishing eligibility for the benefit sought. Matter of Brantigan, 11 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 1966). The petitioner must prove the required elements by a preponderance of the evidence. Matter of Pazandeh, 19 I&N Dec. 884 (BIA 1989). Where the bona fides of a marriage are challenged, the petitioner must present documentary or testimonial evidence to show that it was not entered into for the primary purpose of evading the immigration laws. See Matter of Phillis, 15 I&N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975). However, we note that the failure to produce affirmative evidence of the bona fides of the marriage, by itself, is not sufficient to establish that the marriage is a sham marriage. Compare 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(B), (D) with 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(ii).
 
In the Notice of Intent to Deny the director noted that at a preliminary interview on December 1, 2004, the beneficiary denied ever residing at the address listed on all immigration documents provided in conjunction with the instant visa petition as the primary residence of himself and the petitioner. Concerns were further raised when further investigation revealed that this residence was the same as that involved in a number of cases involved in an immigration fraud scheme related to the parties’ prior attorney. Various issues were noted at a site visit to the residence they allegedly shared, including evidence the petitioner had only recently moved into the apartment, the lack of pictures of them as a couple, the continued lack of joint assets, and the beneficiary’s “superficial knowledge” of the petitioner’s employment history. The notice concluded the parties had not lived together as a married couple, but had attempted to deceive the immigration service in order to obtain an immigration benefit by entering into a marriage that is not bona fide. The petitioner offered an extensive rebuttal to the notice.
 
The director’s decision denying the visa petition found the petitioner’s rebuttal arguments included incorrect assertions regarding statements provided by the beneficiary to immigration officers, and failed to provide a convincing explanation of concerns raised during a site visit by immigration officers. On appeal the petitioner alleges the site visit violated her due process rights, immigration officers had no right to speak with her daughter during the visit as she was not present, neighbors should have been contacted at that time but were not, maintains she and the beneficiary did not need to reside together to establish eligibility for adjustment for him, and offers further arguments regarding concerns raised by the site visit, among other allegations.
 
*2 We agree that the petitioner’s explanations for the numerous concerns raised in this record are not persuasive. In order to establish whether immigration benefits are to be made available based upon a marriage, it must be determined whether the bride and groom intended to establish a life together at the time they were married. Matter of Laureano, 19 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 1983); Matter of McKee, 17 I&N Dec. 332 (BIA 1980), The conduct of the parties before and after marriage is relevant to their intent at the time of marriage. Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604 (1953). Where, as here, there is reason to doubt the validity of the marital relationship, the petitioner must present evidence to show that the marriage was not entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws. Matter of Laureano, supra; Matter of Phillis, 15 I&N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975). Absent evidence that a marriage was a sham in its inception or entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws, a spousal visa petition cannot be denied merely because the parties were separated or no longer together, rather such is only a relevant factor in ascertaining the parties’ intent at the time of the marriage. Matter of Adalatkhah, 17 I&N Dec. 404 (BIA 1980); Matter of McKee, supra.
 
The beneficiary and petitioner both conceded that the address listed as their primary residence on all their initial documentation was, in fact, an address at which neither ever resided, but which instead was their former representative’s address. While the petitioner claims the parties were the “victims” of this individual (who was reportedly convicted of immigration fraud in the context of other immigration claims), there is no evidence the petitioner has attempted to contact this former representative and notify him of the allegations against him. As such, there is not even minimal evidence of compliance with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1stCir. 1988), and we give lessened weight to the petitioner’s claimed ignorance of the fraudulent methods of this individual.
 
Most significant in this record is the absence of evidence the parties entered into their marriage intending to establish a life together. See Matter of McKee, supra. In her rebuttal to the Notice of Intent to Deny and on appeal the petitioner fails to clearly explain exactly when and where she and the beneficiary resided together as a married couple. She vaguely excuses the absence of credible evidence in this regard by suggesting that they have an unconventional marriage. The sole address where she reports living with the beneficiary for an extended period is 1549 Westgate Avenue, Los Angeles. However, the record contradicts this claim, and fails to support her essential claim that her marriage is a bona fide one.
 
*3 The marriage certificate reflects the parties married May 10, 2003, and were both residing at 1107 W. 59th Street, Los Angeles. (However, an immigration investigation revealed that the “mailing address” listed in that document was attributable to the petitioner’s prior representative. The petitioner did not report this fact, and has not rebutted this finding.) In his corrected biography, the beneficiary does not report ever living at this residence. However, a photocopy of the petitioner’s license indicates she reported residing at this address in March of 2002, and a handwritten notation on that document indicates it is her sister’s home. We note that the petitioner sought to excuse her sister’s lack of knowledge in 2006 about “where we lived and when we resided together” and her husband’s then-current address by claiming her sister had “never had much contact” with the beneficiary (Response, pg. 5). The inference, then, is that the beneficiary never resided with the petitioner and her sister at the 59th Street address, nor is there any contrary evidence in this regard.
 
Rather, the record is devoid of any credible evidence regarding where the parties resided when they were married or shortly thereafter. The beneficiary’s biographic information form indicates he resided at 1325 Amhurst Avenue in Los Angeles from December of 2002 through December of 2003. The record contains no evidence regarding that address for either party whatsoever. A handwritten notation on that document notes, moreover, that he reported his address as 10959 Wellworth Avenue at the time of his NSEERS registration on January 8, 2003. As with the Amhurst Avenue address, there is no evidence of either party residing at this address.
 
Contrary to the petitioner’s suggestion otherwise on appeal, it is not sufficient that the parties resided together at some time during the course of their marriage to establish the bona fides of that relationship such that immigration benefits should be awarded. Rather, our inquiry is focused on their intent at the time they married, and the record supports a finding that the petitioner failed to meet her burden of proof in this regard. As noted, the conduct of the parties before and after their marriage is relevant this inquiry. The evidence regarding the claimed residence of the petitioner and beneficiary at 1242 Wellesley Avenue is highly inconsistent. The District Director noted that immigration officer’s conducted a site visit at that location and noted the closets were empty of women’s clothing, the petitioner’s unpacked suitcases were in a room with an empty closet, and it appeared the petitioner and beneficiary had slept apart the prior evening. The apartment was also devoid of any photographs of the parties as a couple.
 
The petitioner has offered evolving and inconsistent explanations for the officers’ observations. In her response to the Notice of Intent to Deny, the petitioner concedes her husband informed the officers he had moved into the Wellesley Avenue address a “few days” prior to the site visit, but failed to include the crucial assertion that he had been living there before that time with his parents (Response at 2). We observe the petitioner later explained the lack of pictures on the walls and the absence of any of her clothing in the closets by stating the beneficiary informed immigration officers “he had just moved in and that he was not pretending to have lived there for a long time” (Response at 3). This contradicts her report that he had, in fact, been living there for an extended period of time prior to his parents moving out.
 
*4 No explanation was offered as to why the beneficiary did not inform officers he had resided in the apartment for an extended time prior to the petitioner’s moving in. Moreover, the petitioner has not explained why she also did not reside there with her husband. She claimed she “frequently” visited there and spent the night, but has not overcome the fact that the apartment contained no photos of her or the couple, and the lack of any indication at the site visit that she kept clothing in the residence other than that contained in her luggage. Moreover, her generalized allegations fail to overcome the fact that the beneficiary informed the immigration officer that he, the beneficiary, and her daughter had lived together at that residence until his parents moved to the United States in mid-2006 (Decision at 2).
 
Similarly, the director correctly noted that the petitioner’s claim that there were no pictures of her and beneficiary as a couple, because he had “just” moved in, was contradicted by her alternative report that he had been living there for months by the time of the site visit and, in fact, she herself had allegedly resided there at one point (Response at 3). As with the majority of the petitioner’s claims regarding her and the beneficiary’s residences, she offered vague and largely uncorroborated assertions about when the residency occurred. She claimed the beneficiary informed the officers that he had “several pictures” and that “most things were still in boxes,” and claimed he subsequently hung up pictures. In contrast, the petitioner claimed on appeal that there were no photos of them together at all the pictures had been moved to the beneficiary’s parent’s new home (Notice of Appeal, pg. 5). She also argued that they “had little reason” to put new pictures on the walls as they intended to vacate the premises shortly thereafter. These allegations are clearly inconsistent. The petitioner offered similarly confused and contradictory explanations for why her clothes were in her suitcase at the apartment rather than put away. On appeal she indicated she was too busy to empty her suitcases, although she allegedly had moved in several days earlier (Notice of Appeal, pgs. 3-4). However, in her response to the Notice of Intent to Deny, she alleged that she, in fact, had “frequently” stayed at the apartment prior to moving in and, in fact, had some clothes in one of the closets, although the immigration officers did not observe this. The record contains no objective evidence whatsoever indicating she ever resided at this address.
 
The petitioner’s inconsistent claims included her explanation for why the beneficiary stated she had only been employed once during the entirety of their marriage when, in fact, she had held several jobs. Her explanation that her other jobs were of such short duration that he did not deem them worth mentioning is belied by the beneficiary’s specific report that she had “no other” employment during the marriage other than working as a telemarketer, which was also of short duration (Response at 5).
 
*5 The only address at which the petitioner allegedly did reside with the beneficiary as a married couple, by the petitioner’s own account, was at 1549 Westgate Avenue (Response at 3-4). The beneficiary’s biographic information reports he began living lived there in January of 2004. It is unclear when the petitioner allegedly resided there since, as with the remainder of her claims, she has offered no clear information in this regard. She reportedly left for Las Vegas in January of 2005, without the beneficiary, although it is unclear where she was living at that time (Response at 5). The only objective evidence of a joint residence at that address are phone and utility bills to the petitioner and beneficiary from November and December of 2004. We note these records, without more, are insufficient to establish they resided there together during that time period, particularly in light of the petitioner’s evolving and unsupported claims regarding their relationship.
 
Thus, by the petitioner’s own account and in light of the evidence of record it appears she and the beneficiary, at best, resided together for a short period, more than a year after their marriage. We agree in light of the sparse documentary evidence of record and the petitioner’s changing claims that she failed to establish the bona fides of the marriage, and has not overcome the concerns raised by the director. In this regard, we find no support for the petitioner’s claim the site visit was a violation of her due process rights. The concerns raised therein were identified in the Notice of Intent to Deny, and the petitioner was afforded an opportunity to respond to the same. Her failure to adequately do so does not constitute a due process violation. We similarly find no merit to her contention that the immigration officers who visited her home inappropriately spoke to her daughter. The daughter’s stepfather, the beneficiary, was present at the time this occurred and any comments made by the daughter have not been used against the petitioner. Finally, in closing we observe that while any financial problems on the part of the petitioner may explain the beneficiary wishing to keep his assets separate from hers, it fails to explain the lack of other evidence they held themselves out as married. Such evidence could include insurance policies, property leases, or other evidence regarding their courtship, wedding ceremony, and shared experiences. Matter of Phillis, 15 I&N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975). In sum, we find no merit to the petitioner’s allegations of error, and concur with the director that the petitioner failed to prove the bona fides of the marriage.
 
The petitioner may file a new visa petition on the beneficiary’s behalf that is supported by competent evidence that the beneficiary is entitled to the status sought under the immigration laws. See 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(D).

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: SAMSON ENCILA
File: AXX XX5 634 - Los Angeles, CA
June 30, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Colin T. Greene, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Piepmeier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; voluntary departure; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision of May 11, 2007, finding him removable as charged and granting him 60 days voluntary departure. During the pendency of the appeal, in lieu of a brief, the respondent filed a motion to remand seeking to reapply for adjustment of status based on his marriage on June 24, 2002 to a lawful permanent resident who subsequently naturalized on August 28, 2003. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) timely filed an opposition to the respondent’s motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed, and his motion to remand will be denied.
 
In his Notice of Appeal (EOIR-26), the respondent asserts that “¿tºhere were miscommunications and/or mistranslations during the interview process since the questions of the Immigration Officer conducting the interview were vague.” To the extent that the respondent is referring to the interview conducted by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on March 11, 2005, which formed the basis for a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) issued on December 28, 2005, and the subsequent decision to deny the visa petition filed on behalf of the respondent on January 13, 2006, when USCIS received no response to its NOID, we note that the respondent’s appeal is untimely and otherwise improperly filed. An appeal from a USCIS decision must be taken within 30 days of the service of that decision by filing a Notice of Appeal (EOIR-29) directly with the USCIS office having administrative control over the record of proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(a)(2). In addition, only the party affected by a decision is entitled to appeal to the Board. See Matter of Sano, 19 I&N Dec. 299 (BIA 1985); Matter of DaBaase, 16 I&N Dec. 720 (BIA 1979); Matter of Kurys, 11 I&N Dec. 315 (BIA 1965). In this case, an appeal from the USCIS decision by the respondent’s spouse would have been due at the USCIS Los Angeles District Office on or before February 13, 2006. However, the respondent (rather than his spouse) filed an EOIR-26 (rather than an EOIR-29) with the Board (rather than the USCIS Los Angeles District Office) on June 11, 2007, approximately 16 months later.
 
*2 The respondent also argues in the EOIR-26 that “¿tºhe former legal representative did not provide us (as the new lawyer) the complete records for this case.” According to the respondent, his new counsel was “not given the opportunity to review and/or examine this case completely.” To the extent that the respondent is making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we note that he failed to comply with any of the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We recognize that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this matter arises, has held that the Lozada requirements need not be rigidly enforced. However, we are not persuaded to dispense with the Lozada requirements entirely in cases such as this one, where ineffective assistance of counsel is not obvious and undisputed on the face of the record. See, e.g., Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). Moreover, the respondent failed to establish how he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), The respondent makes no argument on appeal as to how the outcome of the proceedings might have been different if his new attorneys had had an “opportunity to review and/or examine this case completely.”
 
Finally, the respondent argues in the EOIR-26 that “the Immigration Judge did not give us the opportunity to explain the situation of our client.” It is well-established that under the Fifth Amendment, aliens are entitled to due process of law in removal proceedings. Reno v. Flores, 113 S. Ct. 1439 (1993); Yamataya v. Fisher, 189 U.S. 86 (1903). In this case, we find the respondent’s due process argument to be wholly without merit (Tr. at 32-62).
 
Turning to the respondent’s motion, the requirements for a motion to remand are essentially the same as those for a motion to reopen. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). A motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application and all supporting documentation. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). In this case, the respondent failed to submit a copy of his application of adjustment of status along with his motion to reopen. In addition, the respondent failed to submit the required affidavit of support under section 213A of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1183a. We note that the record contains an affidavit of support executed on December 31, 2003. However, not only is it now more than 4 years old, it reflects that the respondent’s wife, who has been unemployed or retired since 1941, has no income or assets. In order for an intending immigrant to overcome the public charge ground of inadmissibility, his or her sponsor must demonstrate the means to maintain an annual income of at least 125 percent of the Federal poverty line. See 8 C.F.R. § 213a.2(c)(2). In addition, the respondent failed to submit the required medical examination report along with his motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.5.
 
*3 Finally, even if the respondent had submitted the appropriate application and all supporting documentation, he failed to satisfy the requirements set forth in Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). In particular, the respondent failed to produce clear and convincing evidence indicating a substantial likelihood that his marriage to a woman 41 years his senior is bona fide. Evidence establishing that the marriage was entered into in good faith and not for the purpose of procuring an immigration benefit includes: (1) documentation showing joint ownership of property, (2) a lease showing joint tenancy of a common residence, (3) documentation showing commingling of financial resources, (3) a birth certificate of a child or children born to the petitioner and the beneficiary, and (4) affidavits of third parties having knowledge of the bona fides of the marital relationship. See 8 C.F.R. 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(B); see also Matter of Laureano, 19 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 1993). In this case, the respondent produced no such evidence. Finally, as noted above, the DHS opposes the respondent’s motion for reasons unrelated to Matter of Arthur, 20 I&N Dec. 475 (BIA 1992).
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed, and his motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
K. Kerry Yianilos, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lucinda Love
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the June 21, 2007, decision of the Immigration Judge denying her motion to terminate proceedings based on her claim of United States citizenship and ordering her removal to Mexico.
 
The respondent filed both a timely appeal and a motion to reopen removal proceedings. Having reviewed these documents, we will construe the latter as a motion to remand the record to the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4); Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1, 2 (BIA 2000). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a brief responding to the appellate arguments but not to the motion.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding her removable, as she claims that her attorney’s admission that she was born in Mexico was the only evidence offered of her alienage, and was legally insufficient. She further claims that in making such admission, prior counsel was “not fully aware of the facts” and “did not have a grasp on his client’s situation at all.” Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 5-6. We find these arguments to be entirely undermined by the fact that the respondent admits twice in the same brief that she was born in Mexico. Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 1, 5. Nevertheless, it has long been established that an admission by the respondent (or his or her counsel) of birth abroad is sufficient to establish a presumption of alienage and to shift the burden of proof to the respondent. See Murphy v. INS, 54 F. 3d 605, 609 (9th Cir. 1995); Matter of Benitez, 19 I&N Dec. 173 (BIA 1984); Matter of Castro, 16 I&N Dec. 81 (BIA 1976); Matter of A-M-, 7 I&N Dec. 332 (BIA 1956).
 
The respondent also claims on appeal that prior counsel “failed to adequately represent her case” to the extent that she was denied due process of law. Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 4. This claim of ineffective assistance of counsel will be dismissed, as the respondent has failed to substantially comply with the requirements for such a claim as set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that the Lozada requirements need not always be rigidly applied, and that substantial compliance may AXX XXX XXX suffice, particularly where ineffective assistance has been clearly demonstrated, efforts at compliance have been documented, and prejudice has been shown. See Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F. 3d 934 (9th Cir. 2003); Melkonian v. Ashcroft, 320 F. 3d 1061 (9th Cir. 2003); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F. 3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). However, in the present case, the respondent has not shown any effort to comply with Lozada, She has not detailed her agreement with prior counsel, or established that the claimed failures were the fault of prior counsel. In the absence of such evidence, we find the claims as to what efforts prior counsel did or did not undertake to be speculative.
 
*2 We additionally find the respondent’s assertion that the Immigration Judge denied the respondent of due process by rushing to a conclusion on the issue of the respondent’s alienage to be unfounded. Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 4, 6. The record reveals, to the contrary, that the Immigration Judge discussed the issue at each hearing with prior counsel; advised counsel against admitting the respondent’s Mexican citizenship (Tr. at 7-8), advised the respondent to file an application for a certificate of citizenship on Form N-600 (Tr. at 11), and granted adjournments totaling sixteen months before proceeding with the merits hearing.¿FN1º
 
We next turn to the respondent’s motion to remand. In her motion, she has established a new fact that could not have been discovered at the time of the hearing. She was married on September 7, 2007 to a United States citizen. She claims that this new fact would now make her statutorily eligible for the relief of cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(l) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 229b(b)(l).¿FN2º Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 1.
 
The respondent has included with her motion an application for relief on Form EOIR-42B, and has attached supporting documentation. We find that the respondent has satisfied the requirements of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). See Matter of Yewondwosen, 21 I&N Dec. 1025 (BIA 1997). In its brief, DHS has not expressed opposition to the motion to remand. We will thus remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings to determine eligibility for such relief. We therefore need not address the remainder of the respondent’s arguments on appeal.
 
Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge.

Although we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision regarding the issue of the respondent’s alienage, as we are remanding for other reasons, the respondent may submit additional probative evidence regarding the issue of her citizenship to the Immigration Judge.

In his oral decision, the Immigration Judge stated “the respondent is ineligible for cancellation of removal under Section 240A(b) of the Act because she does not have the qualifying relative” (I.J.at 5).

File: AXX XX7 422 - Chicago, IL

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raymond J. Sanders, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alexandra Kostich
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 26, 2007, decision granting him voluntary departure in lieu of removal under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). On appeal, the respondent alleges that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during the course of his removal proceedings and that the Immigration Judge deprived him of due process by discouraging him from seeking asylum under section 208 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158.¿FN1º The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has filed a brief in opposition to the appeal, claiming that the respondent pursued the instant appeal as a dilatory tactic and should, hence, no longer be able to pursue voluntary departure. In the alternative, the DHS asks us to remand the case to the Immigration Judge to impose a new departure bond that is separate from the cash appearance bond that was paid to ensure the respondent’s appearance in the Immigration Court throughout the proceedings. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
Initially, we note that the respondent’s appeal is properly before us because the respondent never waived his right to appeal in accordance with the applicable regulations governing pre-hearing voluntary departure (Tr. at 22-24). See Matter of Ocampo-Ugalde, 22 I&N Dec. 1301, 1302-05 (BIA 2000) (holding that an appeal of a denial of cancellation of removal was properly before the Board from an order granting pre-hearing voluntary departure under the Act, where the alien never expressly waived his right to appeal in accordance with 8 C.F.R. § 240.26(b)(1)(i)(D), the predecessor to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D)). Nevertheless, the respondent’s appeal is lacking in merit. We find no merit in the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Initially, we note that the respondent has failed to comply with any of the procedural requirements listed in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for claims alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. See Patel v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 829, 831-32 (7th Cir. 2007) (finding no abuse of discretion in the denial of a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel based on noncompliance with Lozada factors). Even so, we cannot say that counsel’s alleged errors impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing. See Mojsilovic v. INS, 156 F.3d 743, 748 (7th Cir. 1998). Specifically, the respondent does not allege with any specificity what “poor advice” his counsel afforded him (Form EOIR-26). Further, we cannot conclude that his counsel’s failure to advise him of his time frame for obtaining residency if his United States citizen father sponsored him for a visa adversely affected the respondent. The respondent testified at the hearing that his father had never helped him in this regard or even filed any petitions on his behalf (Tr. at 21), and he has not made any showing on appeal that his situation has changed.
 
*2 Similarly, the respondent’s claims that the Immigration Judge deprived him of due process are lacking in merit. Given the respondent’s failure to demonstrate that he is eligible for an exemption to the 1-year time bar for seeking asylum, or that he is entitled to asylum on the merits, we cannot conclude that the Immigration Judge’s alleged failure to permit the respondent to seek asylum deprived him of a fair hearing or otherwise deprived him of due process.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the respondent’s appeal lacks merit and would ordinarily be subject to dismissal, Nonetheless, as we have already discussed, the Immigration Judge did not have authority to grant the respondent voluntary departure in lieu of removal since the respondent did not waive appeal on all issues (Tr. at 22-24). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D); Matter of Ocampo, supra, at 1304-05. Hence, although the respondent does not appeal the grant of voluntary departure, we cannot reinstate his order of pre-hearing voluntary departure. Instead, we will remand the case to the Immigration Judge to allow the respondent to reapply for voluntary departure in accordance with the requirements set forth in the applicable regulations.¿FN2º On remand, the respondent is not precluded from seeking any other form of relief to which he may be entitled.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s April 26, 2007, order is vacated, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

We note that these allegations were raised in the respondent’s Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26). On January 11, 2008, we denied the respondent’s motion to accept an untimely brief.

2

In light of our decision to remand this case, we need not address, at this time, the DHS’s contention that the Immigration Judge should impose a voluntary departure bond in this case that is separate from the appearance bond that was posted on the respondent’s behalf. We do note, however, that voluntary departure bonds are only required when post-hearing voluntary departure is granted; they are merely permissive when pre-hearing voluntary departure is granted. Compare 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(3) with 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3). In any event, we will allow the Immigration Judge to address the DHS’s contention in the first instance on remand.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. Sec.212(a)(5)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(5)(A)(i)º - No valid labor certification

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case is presently before the Board pursuant to an order issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The order remanded the record to the Board to reconsider the respondent’s motion under Sembiring v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 981 (9th Cir. 2007) and Salta v. INS, 314 F.3d 1076 (9th Cir. 2002). However, the court rejected the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel contention, finding that the Board acted within its discretion in determining that he failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
In reviewing our decision dated October 31, 2006, and the evidence of record, we find that the Board erred in dismissing the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen. We find that the proceedings must be remanded pursuant to Salta v. INS, supra, wherein the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that a sworn affidavit from the alien that neither she nor a responsible party residing at her address received the notice should ordinarily be sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery and entitle an alien to an evidentiary hearing to consider the veracity of her allegations.¿FN1º Id. at 1079. Furthermore, in Sembiring v. Gonzales, supra, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the alien affirmatively sought asylum, indicating that she did not have a motive to avoid immigration proceedings; she appeared in the Immigration Court on her originally scheduled hearing date; and her letter seeking reopening included documentation that supported her claim of lack of receipt of the notice rescheduling her hearing for an earlier date. Id.
 
As in Salta v. INS, supra, there is no indication that the respondent had any motive to avoid the hearing. The respondent appeared for his initial hearing before the Immigration Judge, and he had been a lawful permanent resident in the United States for many years. He also indicated that he contacted the Seattle immigration office numerous times to determine his status and to renew his alien registration card. The respondent submitted an affidavit with his motion to reopen and a declaration on appeal, stating that he moved to Seattle in September or October of 1999, and that he had mailed a change of address form to the Immigration Court in 1999. He also submitted the declaration of his aunt, Maria Henriquez, stating that in the fall of 1999, the respondent came to live with her for about three years. See Hernandez-Ortiz v. INS, 777 F.2d 509, 514 (9th Cir. 1985) (the Board must accept as true the factual statements contained in the affidavits submitted with a motion to reopen); see also Maroufi v. INS, 772 F.2d 597, 600 (9th Cir. 1985) (the Board is required to accept as true the facts stated in an alien’s affidavit in ruling upon a motion to reopen unless it finds those facts to be “inherently unbelievable”).
 
*2 Moreover, the record reflects that the Notice to Appear was served on the respondent by certified mail on June 17, 1997, but it was not filed with the Los Angeles Immigration Court until January 25, 2000.¿FN2º Consequently, if the respondent did file a change of address form with the Immigration Court in 1999, the court would not have had any record of the respondent, nor presumably any file in which to place the change of address form. Based on the facts of this case and the evidence submitted, we find that the respondent has presented sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of effective service.
 
Finally, we note that the record indicates that the respondent was removed from the United States in December 2006. However, the Ninth Circuit held that where the removal proceedings are completed, and the alien is removed, but then reenters the United States unlawfully, he is not prohibited from filing a motion to reopen. Lin v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 979, 982 (9th Cir. 2007); see also Reynoso-Cisneros v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1001 (9th Cir. 2007). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The Board’s October 31, 2006, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s July 28, 2006, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals also noted that “the use of regular mail is now permitted by the governing statute, and that some of the Grijalva-Arrieta proof requirements (e.g. documentary evidence from the Postal Service, third party affidavits indicating improper delivery, etc.), which made perfect sense in connection with certified mail, clearly have no application under a regular mail regime.” Id. at 1080.

On appeal, the respondent submitted a copy of the Department of Homeland Serurity’s “Request to Reschedule NTA Interactive Scheduling System,” dated January 7, 2000, indicating that the case was scheduled to be heard on August 25, 1997, but the NTA was not timely filed with the Office of the Immigration Judge.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Murray D. Hilts, Esquire
*1 This case was last before the Board on February 13, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. On March 14, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent claims that he has presented sufficient evidence to establish that due to ineffective assistance rendered by his former counsel, Robert W. DeKelaita, Esquire, he did not receive the notice of hearing, and therefore, he failed to appear for his hearing on August 3, 2006. After the respondent was ordered removed in absentia, Mr. DeKelaita filed a motion to reopen and a Notice of Appeal on behalf of the respondent. The respondent has submitted numerous documents with his motion in support of his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, including his affidavit, evidence that the respondent has filed a complaint against Mr. DeKelaita with the State Bar of Illinois, and evidence that he has informed Mr. DeKelaita of the allegations of ineffective asisstance of counsel. See Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857 (6th Cir. 2006) (a motion to reopen before the Board due to ineffective assistance of counsel must first present the facts required by Lozada); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
In light of the respondent’s new allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel concerning his former attorney, Mr. DeKelaita, who filed the first motion to reopen, we find that the record must be remanded to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s motion to reopen and a determination as to whether the respondent has established that he failed to appear for his hearing due to ineffective assistance of counsel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). Accordingly, the record will be remanded.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brad Alexander, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Motion to Reopen
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Peru, has made an untimely motion to reopen proceedings that were administratively final on January 15, 2004.¿FN1º The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent’s motion, which was received on April 29, 2008, was filed more than 18 months after the Board’s September 19, 2006, decision in this case and is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R, § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated that she qualifies for any exception to the time limitation on motions to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1129a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(changed country conditions or changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality).
 
However, to the extent that neither our prior decision, nor the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen adequately considered the fact that the respondent was never advised of the civil penalty for failure to voluntarily depart pursuant to section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d),¿FN2º and never considered the respondent’s assertion regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, we find it necessary to sua sponte reopen proceedings. See Tr. at 5-9; May 23, 2006, Statement of Robert A. Pajor and Patricia E. Pajor, at 2 (noting failure of prior attorney to timely file motion to reopen, and fact that prior attorney incorrectly filed motion to reopen). We therefore vacate our decision dated September 19, 2006, and the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 3, 2006, and remand this record to the Immigration Judge for a new decision on the merits of the respondent’s June 12, 2006, motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen proceedings on its own motion is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship).
 
At that time, the Immigration Judge should specifically determine whether the respondent has established due diligence in making her motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, and if so, whether equitable tolling is available to her. See, e.g., Rodas v. U.S. Attorney General 2008 WL 2122416 (11th Cir. 2008), quoting Abdi v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 430 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir.2005) (the statutory 90-day period for filing a motion to reopen is “mandatory and jurisdictional, and, therefore, it is not subject to equitable tolling”). If the Immigration Judge determines that equitable tolling is available, he should then consider whether the respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). In addition, the Immigration Judge should consider what impact the failure to comply with the statutory requirements for voluntary departure orders had on the respondent, and specifically, whether the respondent is precluded from adjustment of status as a result of the Immigration Judge’s failure to give such warnings.¿FN3º Finally, the Immigration Judge should consider whether any other circumstances in this case would warrant sua sponte reopening despite the time bar. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered:
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s September 19, 2006, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s July 3, 2006, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER; The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s motion to reopen in accordance with this decision, and for the entry of a new decision. Both parties may supplement the record, if necessary.

An Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure on January 15, 2004. The respondent did not appeal, and the Immigration Judge’s order became final. The respondent, who subsequently married a U.S. citizen on February 3, 2004, prior to the expiration of voluntary departure on March 21, 2004, and made amotion to reopen on June 12, 2006, which was denied as untimely by the Immigration Judge on July 3, 2006. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from that denial on September 19, 2006.

The respondent’s voluntary departure order was issued on January 15, 2004, prior to the 2006 amendments to section 240B(d) of the Act.

We make no finding or prediction as to the ultimate outcome of any of these claims. We simply require the Immigration Judge to fully consider the assertions made in the respondent’s motion to reopen, to the extent permitted or required by law.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven P. Brazelton, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen and reissue our decision dated March 2, 2006. In our order, we dismissed the appeal of an Immigration Judge order denying a request for a continuance and ordering the respondent removed. The motion is untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent requests reissuance of our decision to allow a petition for review to be timely filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The respondent argues that, as former counsel acknowledge they failed to timely file a petition for review at the Ninth Circuit by filing the currently pending petition late, ineffective assistance of counsel has been established warranting reopening. See e.g. Dearinger v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir. 2000). The motion includes some evidence of compliance with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in that counsel has admitted the late filing in a declaration and also sent a letter to “self-report” the untimely filing to the State Bar of Nevada (see Motion at Exhs. E, F). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
However, the motion does not establish a plausible grounds for relief that would support a finding of substantial prejudice by the former counsel’s incompetence. Jie Lin v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent’s claim is the same as that adjudicated on appeal, i.e., that the Immigration Judge should have granted what would essentially have been an indefinite continuance to wait until the petition (Form I-130) filed on the respondent’s behalf is current. While a continuance may be granted for good cause, as the respondent is not eligible for relief, no good cause had been shown to warrant a continuance. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.6. The priority date for the respondent’s approved petition is January 25, 1996, and, as a fourth preference family-sponsored visa for an alien from Mexico, that category was not current at the time of our decision, and is still not current.¿FN1º
 
The motion does not establish there was ineffective assistance that substantially prejudiced the respondent during the removal proceedings over which we have jurisdiction. See Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241 (9th Cir. 2000); Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968 (9th Cir. 2004). The motion is untimely and does not establish an exception. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nadine A. Brown, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Evalyn Douchy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on April 14, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal. On November 13, 2007, the respondent filed this motion to reopen our decision to enable her to apply for adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. As the motion has been filed more than 90 days after our previous decision, it is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent seeks reopening based on allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel against the attorneys who previously represented her in these proceedings. The 90-day deadline imposed on motions to reopen may be equitably tolled where the motion is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Jin Bo Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154, 160 (2d Cir. 2006). In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, however, an applicant must comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In addition, an applicant seeking to toll the 90-day filing deadline must show that she exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period of time for which she seeks tolling. Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000). In the instant motion, the respondent has utterly failed to comply with any of the Lozada requirements. Furthermore, it is not apparent from the evidence now before us that the respondent exercised due diligence in this matter. In this regard, we note that the respondent has not explained how her former attorneys’ alleged misconduct resulted in the untimeliness of the instant motion, and she has not described any measures that she took leading up to the filing of this untimely motion. We find, therefore, that equitable tolling based on the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel is not warranted in this case.¿FN1º Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

We find no evidence of any exceptional situation which would warrant reopening of the respondent’s case on our own motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (“As a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
George E. Crimarco, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated February 13, 2008. The motion is unopposed. Our review of allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are governed by our analysis in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Matter of Lozada, we stated that a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the applicant setting forth in detail the agreement between the applicant and his legal representative and what actions were to be taken on his behalf, (2) that the counsel whose reputation is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) an indication of whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. In order to succeed in a claim of ineffective assistance of prior counsel, a respondent must also demonstrate that she suffered prejudice as a result. See Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
The respondent maintains that prior counsel, in preparing the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), failed to (i) inform the respondent of the types of evidence that would be necessary to meet the statutory requirement that she demonstrate 7 years’ continuous residence in the United States after having been admitted in any status, and (ii) direct the respondent to gather evidence, and ensure the appearance of her witnesses to testify, in support of her claim that she merited cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion. See Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998). However, when the Immigration Judge and respondent’s counsel discussed the possibility that the respondent had not accumulated sufficient evidence to meet her burden of proof, the respondent stated in court that she had not failed to cooperate with counsel through inattention or design but instead because she was embarrassed to visit his office without the means to pay for his services (Tr. at 18-19). The record contains no response from prior counsel as to the respondent’s current claim of ineffective assistance. On the current record, it is not clear to what extent the respondent’s lack of cooperation, and to what extent prior counsel’s failure to prepare the respondent, were responsible for the dearth of evidence presented before the Immigration Judge. We therefore will remand the record with instructions that the Immigration Judge conduct the appropriate fact-finding to determine whether the respondent has met the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada.
 
*2 If, after resolving the necessary factual and legal arguments, the Immigration Judge determines that the respondent’s claims as to ineffective assistance are without merit, the Immigration Judge should once again enter an order of removal. If, however, the Immigration Judge determines that the respondent’s claims as to ineffective assistance have merit, the Immigration Judge should then entertain any applications for relief from removal.
 
Accordingly, the motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
German T. Flores, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Matthew R. Hall
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Suspension of deportation; fair hearing; remand
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely appeal from a decision, dated March 14, 2007, in which an Immigration Judge denied his application for suspension of deportation for failure to satisfy the extreme hardship and good moral character requirements for such relief.¿FN1º See former section 244 (a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254(a)(1). On January 3, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to remand the record to the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(4). The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
Initially, we will consider the respondent’s motion to remand. The respondent argues that the record should be remanded because the transcript “is replete with indiscernible statements.” See Respondent’s Motion at 16. While it is true that the transcript of the proceedings includes certain indiscernible lines of testimony, the respondent has not specified how such indiscernible testimony might have affected the outcome of this case. Specifically, he has not identified what material facts, if any, were omitted from the record. We find, therefore, that he has failed to show that such indiscernible lines of testimony caused him prejudice. See Matter of Exame, 18 I&N Dec. 303 (BIA 1982). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to remand will be denied.
 
With regard to the respondent’s appeal, we first find that the transcript of the proceedings is sufficiently clear to judge the merits of the appeal. Second, we find that on appeal the respondent has not contested the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact or identified any factual errors underlying the Immigration Judge’s decision. Third, we find that the Immigration Judge properly applied the appropriate legal standards and correctly concluded that the respondent failed to establish eligibility for suspension of deportation on both good moral character and extreme hardship grounds. In sum, we find no reason to alter the Immigration Judge’s decision. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

The respondent also moves for reconsideration of our December 4, 2007, decision denying a previous motion to accept a late-filed appeal brief. The respondent argues that the failure to file the brief in a timely manner was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). He has not shown, however, that he suffered prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Hickman v. Spears, 160 F.3d 1269, 1273 (10th Cir. 1998) (explaining that to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must show, inter alia, that the deficient performance was prejudicial). Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Fatma E. Marouf, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Piepmeier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reissuance
 
*1 On January 25, 2008, the respondent filed this motion to reissue our December 14, 2004, dismissal of his appeal from an Immigration Judge’s July 22, 2003, decision. The respondent claims that the office of his former attorney first informed him of our decision on December 9, 2007. See Tab A (Respondent’s Declaration), at 4. The respondent now requests that we reopen and reissue our decision to enable him to file a timely petition for judicial review. We will grant the motion.
 
Pursuant to the regulations, the Board is obligated to give notice of its decisions by serving them, physically or by mail, upon the parties affected. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(f) and 1003.13. According to the record, the Board mailed its decision dismissing the appeal to the respondent’s former attorney. The respondent claims after the appeal was filed, he repeatedly contacted his former attorney to inquire into the status of his case. See Tab at 3. He further claims that he immediately contacted his former attorney’s office after learning on or about December 8, 2007, that he was required to report before December 14, 2007, to the nearest Immigration and Customs Enforcement office. See Tab A at 4; see also Tab P (Notice to Obligor to Deliver Alien). On December 9, 2007, the office of the respondent’s former attorney informed the respondent that his appeal had been dismissed. See Tab A at 4. The respondent then sought the counsel of his current attorney, and he obtained a copy of his file from his former attorney’s office. Id. at 4-5. In the file, the respondent found a letter, addressed to this Board, in which the respondent’s former attorney states that “¿nºeither our office nor the client is in receipt of the decision notice.” Id. at 5. The respondent has proffered a copy of that letter, dated May 22, 2006, and date-stamped by the Board on May 30, 2006, in which the respondent’s former attorney requested a copy of our December 14, 2004, decision. See Tab Q.
 
Given the particular circumstances of this case, we find it appropriate to reissue our decision dismissing the appeal, thereby enabling the respondent to petition for judicial review. First, the respondent has substantially complied with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board. See Tabs A and T. See also Iturribarria v. I.N.S., 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Second, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has explained that when alien is prevented from filing an appeal in immigration proceeding due to counsel’s error, and is thereby deprived of appellate proceeding entirely, error mandates a presumption of prejudice inasmuch as the adversary process itself has been rendered presumptively unreliable. See Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1045 (9th Cir. 2000). In this case, although the Board properly mailed its decision to the respondent’s former attorney, the May 22, 2006, letter confirms that the respondent was not notified of our decision prior to the deadline for filing a petition for judicial review. Furthermore, in his sworn declaration, the respondent has stated that despite repeated inquiries, his former attorney did not inform him of our decision prior to December 9, 2007. See generally Singh v. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 1170, 1173 (9th Cir. 2007) (remanding a case to the Board to consider and specifically address the effect of affidavits of the alien and his attorney). Accordingly, we will reopen the proceedings on our own motion, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and vacate our December 14, 2004, order. A final order in this matter will be issued as of this date, incorporating by reference the text of the attached vacated order.
 
*2 ORDER: The proceedings are reopened, the respondent’s motion to reissue is granted, and our December 14, 2004, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated December 14, 2004, attached hereto, is hereby reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gabriella Navarro-Busch, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Prepmeier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening; cancellation of removal; voluntary departure
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated March 21, 2007, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider and reopen these proceedings so that she may pursue an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1). The respondent, through counsel, has appealed. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the respondent’s appeal.
 
With regards to the respondent’s motion to reopen, the Ninth Circuit has held that the failure to comply with the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), will not bar consideration of a motion based on the ineffective assistance of counsel, where the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance. See Granados-Oseguera v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 993, 998 (9th Cir. 2006). The factors set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, are intended to ensure both that an adequate factual record exists for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding that ineffectiveness assistance was clear on the face of the record where counsel failed to file application for relief).
 
In this case, the respondent’s counsel was ineffective because she failed to timely file an application for cancellation of removal. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 900 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel failed to file application for cancellation of removal by date imposed by Immigration Judge); Rodriguez-Lariz, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226 (9th Cir. 2002)(finding ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel failed to timely file application for suspension of deportation). The respondent was presumptively prejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance because it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004). In this regard, the respondent’s motion includes an application for cancellation of removal and supporting documentation.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is sustained, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge so that the respondent may be afforded an opportunity to apply for cancellation of removal. At the reopened proceedings, both parties may present additional evidence on the issue of the respondent’s eligibility for relief from removal, and the Immigration Judge shall enter a new decision.

APPLICATION: Reconsider, reopen, remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on April 22, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s September 27, 2007, denial of her motion to reconsider.¿FN1º On April 28, 2008, the respondent filed what appears to be a motion to reconsider captioned “motion to withdraw the former attorney’s motion to reconsider improvidently filed and consider our motion to reopen filed on November 2007 that has not been reviewed.” The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the respondent’s motion. The respondent’s motion to reconsider is granted and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
In her April 28, 2008, motion, the respondent alleges that she had filed a motion to reopen on November 17, 2007, based on ineffective assistance of counsel which the Board failed to consider in their April 22, 2008, decision.¿FN2º See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). On May 12, 2008, the respondent submitted additional documents which reveal that her former attorney had been issued an informal admonition by the Office of Bar Counsel in the District of Columbia on April 24, 2008, relating to her ineffective representation of the respondent before the Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals. Based on our review of the record and the documents submitted by the respondent, we find it appropriate to reopen and remand proceedings to the Immigration Judge to allow the respondent the opportunity to apply for the relief that she seeks. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider is granted. Also, proceedings are reopened and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
H. Fitzmore Harris, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Daniel J. Pornschloegl
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This proceeding has been before the Immigration Judge and the Board on numerous previous occasions. In November 2006, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed, and the respondent filed a timely Notice of Appeal. During the pendency of his appeal, the respondent submitted evidence that his conviction for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance-crack cocaine-had been amended to attempted possession of a controlled substance. Based on the additional evidence submitted, on February 7, 2007, the Board remanded the record for further examination of the respondent’s removability and eligibility for cancellation of removal. During most of his initial proceeding before the Immigration Judge, as well as during the first appeal, the respondent was represented by Melvin Duke.
 
After the Board remanded proceedings, the respondent hired new counsel, Dewey Nelson, to represent him (Tr. dated 3/8/07, 3/15/07, and 3/22/07). In an oral decision issued March 22, 2007, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), based on the amended conviction,¿FN1º and denied all relief. For purposes of the appeal, the respondent again retained Mr. Duke. On June 28, 2007, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion. Our June 28, 2007, decision was our final administrative decision for purposes of appeal. Thereafter, on August 15, 2007, and January 3, 2008, the Board denied two more motions.
 
On February 11, 2008, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen. The motion is untimely, as well as number-barred, and the respondent has not demonstrated that a regulatory exception applies. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2) and (3). The respondent alleges that the time and number limitations should be equitably tolled because Mr. Duke provided ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The fact that Mr. Duke was disbarred by the state of New York in 2000, and may not have been qualified to practice before the Immigration Courts or the Board, does not demonstrate per se ineffective assistance of counsel, or otherwise satisfy the requirements of equitable tolling, so as to to justify reopening sua sponte.¿FN2º
 
*2 To warrant equitable tolling, the respondent must show, inter alia, that he exercised due diligence during the period he seeks to have tolled. Habchy v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 858 (8th Cir. 2006); Kanyi v. Gonzales, 406 F.3d 1087 (8th Cir. 2005). In the instant case, the respondent admits that he was concerned about Mr. Duke’s representation as of October 2006. The respondent was apparently so concerned about Mr. Duke’s representation that, after the Board remanded proceedings, he retained new counsel. He then, however, hired Mr. Duke again for purposes of filing another appeal, as well as filing motions to reopen. Since the respondent was on notice as early as October 2006 regarding Mr. Duke’s alleged ineffectiveness, and has not provided an adequate explanation, the respondent has not demonstrated due diligence in raising ineffective assistance of counsel at this late date.
 
Further, the respondent has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by Mr. Duke’s actions. The Immigration Judge held that the respondent was removable under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, which provides, with certain exceptions not applicable here, that an alien convicted of a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State relating to a controlled substance as defined in 21 U.S.C. § 802, is inadmissible (I.J. Dec. dated 3/22/07 at 4). The record indicates that the respondent was convicted of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in violation of New York Penal Law § 220.09, Subsection 1 (Gp. Exh. 8, Tab A and Transcript of Plea Agreement). According to the transcript of the plea agreement, the narcotic drug involved was crack cocaine (Gp. Exh. 8, Transcript). See also Respondent’s Rebuttal filed 2/1/07, Exh. A). The respondent’s state conviction is a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. See 21 U.S.C. §§ 802(6) and (17); 21 U.S.C. §§ 812, Schedule II(a)(4); 21 U.S.C. § 846; NY. Penal Law, § 220.09 subs. 1; N.Y. Pub. Health Law § 3306, Schedule II(b)(4). It is clear, therefore, that the respondent was removable under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act.
 
The respondent contends that Mr. Duke should have contested removability because his certificate of disposition conviction documents indicate that he was convicted under New York Penal Law § 220.09.00, but § 220.09 does not include a subsection “00”, that the respondent did not admit to possessing crack cocaine, and the transcript of the plea agreement was not properly admitted. We disagree. The certificate of disposition indictment indicates that the respondent was convicted under § 220.09, not § 220.09.00. Further, the transcript of the plea agreement, which was admissible, clearly indicates that the respondent’s amended conviction was for crack cocaine under § 220.09 subsection 1 (Gp. Exh. 8, Transcript). See Shepard v. U.S., 544 U.S. 13, 16 (2005)(court may examine, inter alia, transcript of plea colloquy); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41.¿FN3º The transcript of the plea agreement was marked as evidence, and treated as admitted since the Immigration Judge relied on it in reaching his decision, and neither Mr. Nelson nor the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) objected.
 
*3 It is unclear, moreover, why current counsel is challenging the Immigration Judge’s reliance on the transcript of the plea agreement. Without it, the record of proceeding would include two convictions for controlled substances-a certificate of disposition conviction for attempted criminal possession, as well as for attempted criminal sale, because the certificate regarding the conviction for attempted criminal possession does not indicate that it amended the attempted criminal sale conviction. Moreover, the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in immigration proceedings, but to the extent such rules apply, the transcript’s authenticity cannot be questioned at this time because there is no question that the transcript of the plea agreement is what it was purported to be-the transcript of the respondent’s original plea and conviction for attempted criminal sale, his sentencing, and his amended conviction.¿FN4º Accordingly, the respondent has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by Mr. Duke’s alleged ineffectiveness regarding removability.
 
Since the respondent was removable under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, he was not eligible to adjust his status because there was no waiver available for inadmissability under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, except for simple possession of a small amount of marihuana, see section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), and, accordingly, the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice. With regard to voluntary departure, the respondent was not eligible for such relief while the proceeding was pending before the Immigration Judge. See section 240B(b)(l)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(1)(B); section 101(f)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)(3). Further, at that time, he was not represented by Mr. Duke, and there is no claim of ineffective assistance pending against Mr. Nelson.
 
Regarding the respondent’s argument that Mr. Duke failed to pursue naturalization once the respondent became eligible, the respondent has also not demonstrated prejudice. It is fundamental that Immigration Judges and the Board do not have the authority to determine whether an alien in proceedings is prima facie eligible for naturalization for purposes of terminating proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1239.2(f). See Matter of Hidalgo, 24 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2007)(Because the Board of Immigration Appeals and the Immigration Judges lack jurisdiction to adjudicate applications for naturalization, removal proceedings may only be terminated pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1239.2(f) where the DHS has presented an affirmative communication attesting to an alien’s prima facie eligibility for naturalization.). See also Matter of Cruz, 15 I&N Dec. 236 (BIA 1975). An applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that he has been a person of good moral character, and the DHS may consider conduct and behavior beyond the statutorily prescribed period. 8 C.F.R. § 316.10. The respondent filed his application for naturalization with DHS on or about November 30, 2007. As of today’s date, the respondent has not presented evidence that he has obtained an affirmative communication attesting to his prima facie eligibility from the DHS, and, therefore, cannot demonstrate prejudice. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

We note that the Immigration Judge did not consider whether the conviction was amended for substantive or procedural defects in the underlying conviction unrelated to an immigration purpose, see Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003), and the respondent did not submit any evidence (as opposed to argument by counsel) as to why the conviction was amended.

We note, in this regard, that Mr. Duke was still licensed to practice law in the state of New Jersey, although it is unclear why state reciprocity provisions were not invoked. We further note that Mr. Duke did not notify either the Board or the Immigration Judge that he had been disbarred in New York, even though the Notice of Appearance forms request such information. In January 2008, Mr. Duke was suspended from practicing before the Board or Immigration Courts.

During his initial plea, the respondent identified the drug in question as “crack”. The trial court then asked if “that crack cocaine had an aggregate weight of more than an eight of an ounce, is that true?”, and the respondent answered “Yes.”

Further, the Immigration Judge considered the transcript of the plea agreement on remand while Mr. Nelson, not Mr. Duke, represented him, and the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, or otherwise demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel regarding Mr. Nelson.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondents, natives and citizens of Brazil, appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision of September 20, 2006. We will accept this appeal by certification pursuant to our authority in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c). See generally Matter of Liadov, 23 I&N Dec. 999 (BIA 2006). However, the respondents* appeal will be dismissed on the merits.
 
As an initial matter, we note that the respondents have submitted new evidence on appeal, including a letter from the First Brazilian Baptist Church of South Florida dated October 2005, a pamphlet from the Community Blood Centers of South Florida (CBCSF) indicating that Elaine Hernandez, who is of unknown relation to the respondents, gave blood on October 24, 2006, and two printouts from a Florida Department of State website (www.sunbiz.org) relating to Paint by Manny and Prachel Painting and Waterproofing.
 
This Board is an appellate body whose function is to review, not to create, a record. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984). Accordingly, we cannot consider any new evidence presented for the first time on appeal, and any party asserting that this Board cannot properly resolve an appeal without further fact-finding must file a motion to remand. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). In this case, even if we construe the respondents’ submission as a motion to remand, the new evidence that the respondents seek to offer is either immaterial, as in the case of the CBCSF pamphlet, or was previously available and could have been discovered or presented at the former hearing on September 20, 2006, as in the case of the church letter and the printouts from www.sunbiz.org. See C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Accordingly, we will adjudicate the appeal based upon the evidence contained in the record when it was before the Immigration Judge.
 
On appeal, the respondents argue that they received ineffective assistance of counsel from the seven attorneys who represented them at various junctures during the last 10 years. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this matter arises, in order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must establish that his or her counsel’s performance was deficient to the point that it impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing such that the alien was unable to reasonably present his or her case. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2005). In addition, the alien must establish that he or she suffered prejudice as a result of counsel’s ineffective assistance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Prejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 1274.
 
*2 In this case, the respondents have not complied with any of Lozada’s procedural requirements. They have not provided detailed affidavits setting forth the agreements that they reportedly entered into with each of their seven attorneys. They have not informed the individuals whose integrity or competence is being impugned of the allegations leveled against them and given them an opportunity to respond. Nor have they indicated whether complaints have been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. Although the respondents present a sympathetic case, they have failed entirely to comply with any of Lozada’s procedural requirements, which the Eleventh Circuit has determined are not unduly onerous. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the respondents’ appeal is dismissed, and their motion to remand is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Zareefa Khan, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)º - Convicted of crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision dated April 1, 2008. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed any opposition to the respondent’s current motion, and we therefore deem the current motion to be unopposed. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g). The motion is denied.
 
A motion to reconsider requires an assertion by the moving party that the original decision be reexamined in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. See generally Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 404 (BIA 1991); 8C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Initially, we note that in support of his motion, the respondent has cited cases arising outside the Eleventh Circuit. However, this Board historically follows a court’s precedent in cases arising in that circuit. See Matter of Olivares, 23 I&N Dec. 148, 149 (BIA 2001), citing Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25, 31 (BIA 1989). Thus, the cases cited by the respondent arising outside the Eleventh Circuit are not controlling.
 
In the instant case, the respondent has failed to present additional legal arguments which could not have been made during our earlier review of this matter on April 1, 2008. Additionally, the respondent appears to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, a petitioner attempting to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must at least “substantially” comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the requirements a respondent must meet in order to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel). See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir. 2003). In the instant matter, the respondent has failed to do so. The respondent has not identified any change in the law affecting his appeal nor has he identified an aspect which we overlooked during our prior review on April 1, 2008. Having considered the respondent’s contentions, we are not persuaded to disturb our decision dated April 1, 2008, for the reasons stated therein.

IN RE: SERGIO SUAREZ DOMINGUEZ
File: AXX XX8 214 - San Antonio, TX
May 15, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Justin Adams
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Rescission
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed an Immigration Judge’s June 26, 2007, decision denying his motion to reopen the Immigration Judge’s April 9, 2007, decision ordering him removed in absentia. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the respondent’s appeal. The appeal is dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent avers the Immigration Judge failed to consider that he did not appear at his hearing as he was misled by his attorney (Notice of Appeal). He maintains former counsel failed to inform him that it was possible a pending motion to change venue could be denied, and the respondent was required to appear at his scheduled hearing (Resp.’s Br.). The respondent contends he had no reason to avoid his hearing, and asks that his case be reopened.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen was essentially based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. As the Immigration Judge correctly noted, the respondent did not comply with any of the requirements for such a claim, as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Such a motion should be supported by 1) an affidavit setting forth “in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken,” as well as any representations made by counsel to the alien; 2) proof that the movant has informed former counsel of the allegations in writing, as well as any response received; and 3) a statement detailing “whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not.” Id. As the respondent’s motion did not include any of the noted evidence, the Immigration Judge did not err in finding that reopening was not warranted.
 
For the respondent’s benefit, we further note it is well-established that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the respondent of his responsibility to appear, and unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988); Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 1985), aff’d, Patel v. INS, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986). A respondent should not assume that a motion for a change of venue will be granted. Matter of Rivera, supra.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Linda L. Walker, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision dated March 13, 2008. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent argues for the first time in an attachment to his motion for reconsideration that his failure to meet the 90-day filing period for submitting a motion to reopen was due to “wrong advice from ¿hisº previous lawyer.” He further states that he consulted the lawyer on July 17, 2007, 5 days after the Immigration Judge’s July 12 2007, decision, and was advised to “wait until ¿heº received another communication from the Immigration Office, which should arrive in about 90 days.”
 
“A motion to reconsider is a request that the Board reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked. A motion to reconsider challenges the Board’s original decision and alleges that it is defective in some regard.” Matter of O-S-G, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57 (BIA 2006) (citations omitted). To the extent that the respondent is raising a claim of ineffective assistance by his former counsel, he has failed to comply with any of the requirements for asserting such a claim outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).¿FN1º See Lara v. Trominiski, 216 F.3d 383, 389 (5th Cir. 2000) (general application of the Lozada requirements does not constitute an abuse of discretion by the Board). The respondent failed to submit an affidavit outlining in full his contacts with his prior attorney, and failed to provide his former counsel with an opportunity to respond. It is unclear what correspondence the respondent would have been waiting for after the Immigration Judge issued a final decision in this case, nor has the respondent indicated whether he was aware of, or was explained, the filing requirements for submitting a motion to reopen. Moreover, we find that the respondent could and should have addressed the timeliness issue during his appeal. While the respondent states in his motion for reconsideration, through counsel, that he just realized that an October 23, 2007, letter addressed to the Immigration Judge, which outlined his timeliness argument, was sent to the wrong address, he could and should have argued this issue in his appeal brief to the Board. We therefore find that the respondent has failed to establish a basis for equitable tolling of the statutory filing period. See Coleman v. Johnson, 148 F,3d 398, 402 (5th Cir. 1999) (“A garden variety claim of excusable neglect does not support equitable tolling.”); Davis v. Johnson, 158 D3d 806, 811 (5th Cir. 1998) (Equitable tolling is permitted only “in rare and exceptional circumstances.”). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of EI Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s November 30, 2007, decision. In that decision the Immigration Judge, inter alia, denied his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), as a matter of discretion. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.
 
The respondent alleges ineffective assistance by former counsel as, although the family told the former counsel that a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder had been made and requested that the counsel obtain the respondent’s medical records, his former counsel failed to do so. It is asserted that respondent’s former counsel clearly did not understand the significance of these medical records as he told the family that these records would not be helpful. We note that in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), we laid out the requirements that a respondent must meet in order to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. First, the motion should be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent attesting to the relevant facts. Second, before the allegation is presented to the Board, the former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond. Any subsequent response from counsel, or report of counsel’s failure to respond, should be submitted with the motion. Finally, if it is asserted that prior counsel’s handling of the case involved a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, the motion should reflect “whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not.” Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997).We note that the United States Court of Appeal for the Fourth Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this matter arises, in Stewart v. INS, 181 F.3d 587, 596 (4th Cir. 1999), declined to consider an alien’s argument of ineffective assistance of counsel where the alien failed to provide an affidavit detailing his agreement with counsel, failed to inform counsel of the allegation against him or her and provide him or her with opportunity to respond, and failed to indicate whether the complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities.
 
*2 Here, the respondent, after delineating the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, indicated that affidavits have been submitted from the respondent’s brother and father attesting, on behalf of the respondent, to the relevant facts. In the brother’s affidavit, he indicated that a complaint had been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation and the respondent’s current counsel related that he had attempted to contact respondent’s former counsel to advise him of the charges against him. The respondent’s father related that he was involved in retaining the former counsel to represent the respondent and paid some of the fees, but never saw a written contract. While the respondent has attempted to comply with the Lozada requirements, to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at a deportation proceeding, an alien must show not only ineffective representation, but also prejudice to him which occurred as a result of that ineffectiveness. See Figeroa v. INS, 886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir. 1989).
 
In the instant case the respondent has presented medical evidence indicating that in August 2007 he underwent a psychiatric evaluation, resulting in several psychiatric diagnoses, and that he had been receiving treatment for a period of time. He argues that his then current attorney failed to present this evidence at his removal hearing. The respondent’s brother has provided a statement detailing a conversation with the prior attorney describing the information the brother provided to the attorney, and the attorney’s judgment that the medical evidence would not help the respondent. After noting that he was at the removal hearing but was not asked to testify, the respondent’s brother detailed the information relevant to the respondent’s mental health he would have provided. The Board notes that, in closing arguments before the Immigration Judge, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) pointed to the respondent’s contention that he had been diagnosed with a bipolar disorder which might explain his criminal history, but that there was no evidence in the record (Tr. at 136). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s claim of a bipolar disorder was not credible, noting the lack of corroboration, including the lack of evidence that he had ever being formally evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist (I.J. at 5). While the respondent’s attorney had indicated that he had attempted to talk to a physician at the facility where the respondent had been held (Tr. at 136), there is no indication that a written request for the respondent’s medical records was made.
 
We conclude that the respondent, by reason of his former counsel’s apparent failure to request and submit the respondent’s medical records into evidence, has demonstrated that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, we find that the respondent was prejudiced, particularly in light of fact that this lack of corroboration caused the Immigration Judge to call the respondent’s credibility into question.
 
*3 Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, and the removal proceedings will be remanded for further consideration of the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal, to include, if desired, the submission of additional evidence by the parties.
 
The following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN RE: FITZGERALD ALPHONSO SANCHEZ
File: AXX XX4 772 - Los Angeles, CA
April 24, 2008
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Justin W. Chaney, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Piepmeier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on January 24, 2008. The final administrative order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on March 26, 1992. The pending motion was filed well over a decade late. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent argues, alternatively, that the Board did not properly mail a copy of its 1992 decision to his prior counsel, or that his prior counsel failed to properly mail a copy of the decision to him. Inasmuch as the record indicates that the Board properly served its decision on the respondent’s attorney of record, we will address his alternative ineffective assistance of counsel argument. The respondent, through current counsel, claims that former counsel told him that “as long as he does not receive a bag and baggage letter then everything was ok”, and that he did not hear anything more until he was detained by DHS in 2007. He also indicates, in his brief, that his prior attorney was supposed to file an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In support of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent has submitted, inter alia, a copy of a letter that he wrote to his former counsel indicating that he would be filing a complaint with the state bar if this Board determines that the 1992 decision was properly served; he further submits a letter from his prior counsel indicating that his office has no information on the respondent because office policy mandates that closed cases are held for seven years after which time all information in the case is shredded.
 
There is an inadequate basis for tolling the motion to reopen period in this case. See Valeriano v. Gonzales, 474 F.3d 669, 673 (9th Cir. 2007); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003) (individual seeking to rely upon “equitable tolling” of a filing deadline must show that he has acted with due diligence). Despite his claims against former counsel, the respondent fails to demonstrate why he waited so long to contact new counsel and file the pending motion. As the DHS states in its response, the respondent has not provided any reasonable explanation as to why he did not inquire about the status of his case with either his attorney or the Board during the past 15 years. Moreover, even were the motions deadline tolled in this case, the motion would be denied for failure to show prejudice resulting from the alleged failures of prior counsel. Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F. 3d 1182, 1189 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&NDec. 553 (BIA2003); Matter of Lozada, 19I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In order to show the required prejudice, the respondent must show “plausible grounds for relief.” Serrano v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 1317,1319 (9th Cir. 2006). The respondent has failed to make this showing. The respondent had a full and fair hearing on his application for section 212(c) relief before the Immigration Judge, and the Board considered all the relevant factors before finding that the Immigration Judge had correctly concluded that a favorable exercise of discretion was unwarranted in the respondent’s case. The motion is, therefore, denied.

File: AXX XX1 399 - Eloy, AZ
April 18, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kuyomars Golparvar
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION; Cancellation of removal
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Thailand, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 9, 2008. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on March 7, 1995. On October 26, 2006, the respondent was convicted in two separate cases (F04901939-9 and F06903726-8) for possession of methamphetamine in violation of section 11377(a) of the California Health and Safety Code.
 
We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is removable as charged under section 237 (a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), as an individual convicted of offenses relating to a controlled substance. The respondent conceded that he was removable on this basis at the hearing (Tr. 23). The charge is supported by conviction records which show that the respondent pleaded guilty to illegal possession of methamphetamine, as set forth above.
 
We have thoroughly reviewed of the transcript of proceedings and the evidentiary record. We are satisfied that the respondent received a full and fair hearing in this matter.
 
We find no merit in the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We note initially that the respondent has failed to comply in any measure with the procedural requirements for such claims set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (compliance with Lozada, supra, is generally required to assert claim of ineffective assistance of counsel). We find no evidence in the transcript of proceedings that the respondent’s former attorney, Ms. Monika Sud-Devaraj, who was substituted for the respondent’s initial counsel and represented him at his master calendar and merits hearings, was negligent in her representation. We find no indication that the respondent had any difficulty communicating with Ms. Sud-Devaraj, and we note that the court provided a Thai interpreter at the respondent’s merits hearing. The Board does not have the authority to review the respondent’s custody status in these proceedings, as bond and removal proceedings are separate and apart. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(d). However, we note that it would not have been improper for Ms. Sud-Devaraj to withdraw a pending request for bond because the respondent’s drug conviction made him subject to mandatory detention. See section 236(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c). We do not find that any action or inaction of former counsel in this matter resulted in prejudice.¿FN1º See Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000) (alien must show that the allegedly ineffective representation may have affected the outcome of the case); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 We are satisfied that the Immigration Judge thoroughly considered the record and properly weighed the adverse factors evidencing the respondent’s undesirability as a permanent resident against the social and humane considerations presented on behalf of the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal (I.J. at 4-8). See Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998). We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny this relief in the exercise of discretion.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

No prejudice resulted from the failure of the respondent’s initial counsel to appear for a master calendar hearing (Brief at 6). The Immigration Judge simply reset the hearing for another date.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This matter was last before the Board on February 5, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the entry of a removal order. The Board had previously sustained the DHS’s appeal of the grant of section 212(c) relief. The respondent now moves to reopen to pursue adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition. The motion to reopen will be granted.
 
The respondent wants to pursue adjustment of status, and moves for reopening on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. A motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days after entry of the final administrative decision in the case. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent argues that this time period should be equitably tolled because he was unaware of his former counsel’s ineffectiveness until counsel realized in August 2007 that the respondent had been eligible for adjustment of status, and advised the respondent to consult with other counsel. The respondent did so, and new counsel filed this motion to reopen in September 2007, less than 90 days after the respondent learned of his former counsel’s error. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the respondent acted diligently and is entitled to equitable tolling of the time period for filing a motion to reopen. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 898 (9th Cir. 2003) (attorney misconduct may warrant equitable tolling until alien met with new counsel and discovered former counsel’s fraud).
 
Typically, to warrant reopening based on the ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must comply with the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10(1st Cir. 1988), and demonstrate that he was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance. The Ninth Circuit has held that the failure to comply with the Lozada requirements will not bar consideration of the motion where ineffective assistance of counsel is clear from the record. Granados-Oseguera v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 993, 998 (9th Cir. 2006). “Lozada is intended to ensure both that an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). The record of the proceedings themselves may be adequate to serve those functions. Id (holding that ineffectiveness was clear on the face of the record where counsel failed to file application for relief).
 
*2 Here, the record sufficiently reveals the ineffectiveness of the respondent’s former counsel in failing to seek adjustment of status. It is apparent from the record that the respondent is eligible for adjustment of status. His wife is a United States citi2en and has been throughout these proceedings. They were married long before the commencement of these proceedings. Although the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, that conviction does not render him inadmissible because of the petty offense exception. Section 212(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II) of the Act, 8US.C. § 1182(aX2)(A)(ii)(II). The respondent’s crime was charged as a misdemeanor punishable by not more than 1 year of imprisonment, and he was sentenced to only 60 days in jail. See Cal. Penal Code § 264(a) (Deering 1991); Exh. 2. We are not persuaded by the DHS’s argument that the respondent’s conviction bars him from a favorable exercise of discretion. The exercise of discretion requires a balancing of all favorable and adverse factors.
 
The respondent thus appears prima facie eligible for adjustment of status. There is no tactical reason why counsel would have declined to pursue such relief. The Board’s August 30, 2005, order which found the respondent ineligible for section 212(c) relief remanded the record to the Immigration Judge “for further proceedings” including a removal order “as warranted.” It thus left open the possibility of pursuit of adjustment of status at that time.
 
Under these circumstances, counsel’s ineffectiveness is apparent on the record. Thus, under controlling Ninth Circuit law, the Lozada requirements are satisfied. Prejudice is also apparent on the record, as the respondent is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status and was prevented from pursuing that relief. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra, at 527 n. 12. The respondent has submitted an application for adjustment of status and supporting documentation along with his motion to reopen. We conclude that the respondent met his burden of showing that reopening is warranted. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be granted.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

FILE: AXX XX6 057 - ATLANTA, GA
April 11, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mario Ninfo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Removability; cancellation of removal; suspension of deportation
 
*1 The respondent has appealed an August 29, 2006, Immigration Judge’s order finding her removable, and ineligible for relief from removal. In doing so, the Immigration Judge noted the respondent had not filed for any relief. The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the respondent admitted the truth of the factual allegations and charges of removability (Tr. at 16).¿FN1º On appeal she does not allege any error in this regard. Rather, she contends the Immigration Judge erred in finding her removable as an aggravated felon (Resp.’s Br. at 4-5). However, the Immigration Judge made no such finding. Rather, as noted, she admitted removability as charged under sections 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) and (II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), (II) (Exh. 1). We similarly find no merit to the respondent’s generalized allegation that she was afforded ineffective assistance of counsel by an unidentified individual in an unknown manner (Notice of Appeal). The respondent has in no manner complied with the requirements enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) for such a claim. To the extent she contends counsel who represented her in her criminal proceedings provided her with ineffective assistance, such a claim is in the nature of a collateral attack on her conviction (Resp.’s Br. at 5-6). However, neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board can entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to determine the guilt or innocence of the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996); Matter of Fortis, 14 I&N Dec. 576, 577 (BIA 1974).
 
While the respondent suggests she should be permitted to seek suspension of deportation, such relief is not available to her as she is in removal proceedings. Section 240A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b (Resp.’s Br. at 7-8). The respondent also avers she is eligible for cancellation of removal (Tr. at 7-8). However, she admittedly was convicted of manufacture/delivery of more than 2,000 but less than 5,000 grams of marijuana, and was sentenced to serve 60 days in jail and 24 months probation (Resp.’s Br. at 4; Exh. 1). Section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act defines an aggravated felony as “illicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substance Act (“CSA”)), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18, United States Code).” Illicit trafficking in a controlled substance is commonly defined as an unlawful trading or dealing in a controlled substance. See Matter of Davis, 20 I&N Dec. 536, 540-41 (BIA 1992). Further, section 924(c)(2) of Title 18 defines a drug trafficking crime as “any felony punishable under the CSA.” See Lopez v. Gonzales, 127 S.Ct. 625, 631 (2006). Pursuant to Lopez, supra, a state offense constitutes a “felony punishable under the ¿CSAº” only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law. Id. at 633.
 
*2 The respondent’s conviction may therefore qualify as an aggravated felony under section 101 (a)(43)(B) of the Act, as the transfer of such quantity of marijuana is punishable as a felony under the CSA. See 21 U.S.C. §§ 802(8), (11) (including in the CSA definition of distribution “the actual, constructive, or attempted transfer of a controlled substance”), 812(c) (listing marijuana as a controlled substance), 841 (a)(1), (b)(1)(D) (punishing distribution of marijuana as a felony under the CSA). See also Lopez v. Gonzales, supra at 633 (analyzing the term “drug trafficking crime” included in section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, and holding “that a state offense constitutes a ‘felony punishable under the ¿CSAº’ only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law”).
 
Consequently, the evidence of record “indicates” that a ground for mandatory denial of the respondent’s cancellation of removal application - specifically, a conviction for an aggravated felony - “may apply.” See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). The respondent therefore bears the burden of establishing that her conviction for delivery of marijuana does not qualify as an aggravated felony, Id. The respondent has not submitted any evidence to meet this burden, and thus has failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the mandatory ground of denial enumerated at section 240A(a)(3) of the Act does not bar her from obtaining cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act. Based on the foregoing, we find that the respondent has failed to establish statutory eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, and we therefore find no support for the respondent’s contention she is eligible for cancellation of removal, and, further, no basis for remand of the instant proceedings.¿FN2º We recognize that the respondent has cited a variety of humanitarian factors that she wishes to have considered in our adjudication of her claim. However, while compelling, these factors relate to relief in the form of cancellation of removal, a form of relief for which she is ineligible.
 
In closing, we find no support for the respondent’s various allegations of constitutional infirmity in her removal proceedings (Resp.’s Br. at 4-7). We are not unsympathetic to the situation faced by the respondent. However, it is well-settled that this Board cannot entertain constitutional challenges to the statutes we administer. See Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1035 (BIA 1 999). In sum, we find no error by the Immigration Judge in finding the respondent ineligible for relief.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.¿FN3º

FOR THE BOARD

Therefore, and in light of the fact that the respondent’s ineligibility for relief was established on the pleadings, we find no error by the immigration Judge in issuing a summary order. See Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999).

2

The issue of whether the DHS conclusively established that the respondent has been convicted of an aggravated felony is immaterial to our disposition of the instant appeal, as it is uncontested that the respondent is removable as charged, and the respondent bears the burden of proving that she has not been convicted of an aggravated felony for purposes of establishing eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act. As noted, that burden has not been met.

3

For the respondent’s benefit we note she appears to suggest on appeal that her conviction be vacated on the merits of the underlying criminal procedures, such as noncompliance with any associated requirement that a defendant be informed of the immigration consequences of the conviction, rather than simply for immigration purposes. See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). Unless and until this occurs, her conviction is considered final for purposes of our review. However, should her conviction be thusly vacated, she should file a motion to reopen with this Board and, if the same is untimely filed, seek sua sponte reopening of the proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert D. Kolken, Esquire
*1 APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has filed a motion to reopen and remand the record of his removal proceedings to the Immigration Judge, so that he may pursue an application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255. He is married to a United States citizen who has filed a visa petition on his behalf. See Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002) (stating that motion may be granted notwithstanding the pendency of the visa petition). The motion to reopen will be granted, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
Although this motion is untimely, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel previously and he has, substantially, complied with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir 1988). See Vang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133 (2d Cir. 2007). In this regard, we note that he had filed for a visa petition based on his current marriage previous to our final decision in this case. The brief previous to our final decision, however, only asked that we consider his appeal regarding a pending employment visa petition and one filed by his father. At that time, had the Board been properly notified, a remand would have been appropriate. See Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002).
 
While the Board is concerned that well over 3 years have passed since the visa petition was filed and the respondent has submitted no indiction of its current status, we will, nonetheless, reopen the proceedings. We note that the Department of Homeland Security has not indicated any opposition to the current motion. At the reopened proceedings, it will be incumbent upon the respondent to demonstrate the current status of the petition and the likelihood of its success. The Immigration Judge may then consider the totality of the circumstances in deciding how best to proceed. The following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings.

*1 The respondent has filed an appeal from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated September 28, 2006, in which the Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal and further found that his applications for relief from removal were abandoned. The respondent has also moved to remand the record for further proceedings on the basis that his former attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the respondent claims that his former attorney, Rita Mahdessian, failed to timely file the appropriate application for relief from removal, falsely advised the respondent that she had complied with the filing and other requirements set forth by the Immigration Judge, and failed to advise the respondent that she was suspended from the practice of law at the time she initially provided him with legal counsel. We have no indication in the record before us that the Department of Homeland Security opposes the respondent’s motion to remand. The motion is therefore deemed unopposed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The motion will be granted.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640.
 
The respondent has complied with the technical requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, and his former attorney has not disputed his allegations. Additionally, the record suggests that the respondent is eligible to be considered for the relief he seeks, a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (Tr. at 9). Accordingly, we find the respondent has established ineffective assistance of counsel. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that attorney’s failure to timely file a suspension of deportation application was negligence); see also Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893 (9th Cir. 2008) (alien need not demonstrate she would win on claim absent deficient performance of counsel).
 
*2 Accordingly, we will remand the record for further proceedings on the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eugene Khavinson, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; Reopening
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Armenia. This matter was last before us on November 30, 2007, when we dismissed her appeal of the Immigration Judge’s April 21, 2006, decision ordering her removal. We found no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s application for adjustment of status based on her failure to adduce clear and convincing evidence of the bona fides of her marriage to a United States citizen (I.J. at 2-3). See Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). We also found that the Immigration Judge did not err in refusing to accept such evidence on the day of the hearing or grant a continuance, as the respondent had over 3 months to submit documentation within 10 days of the hearing and failed to exercise due diligence (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. Presently before the Board is a motion to reconsider our decision and a separate motion to reopen based on based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The motions are denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must specify the asserted errors in the prior Board decision and be supported by relevant authority. Section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing procedural requirements for motions to reconsider). A motion to reconsider challenges the Board’s original decision as defective in some respect, based on the previous factual record. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402-03 (BIA 1991). The filing of a motion to reconsider is not a process through which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief submitted on appeal and seek reconsideration by generally alleging error in the Board’s prior decision. Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 58. The movant must specify the factual and legal issues raised on appeal that were erroneously decided or overlooked in our initial decision, or show how a change in the law materially affects the prior decision. Id.
 
Here, the respondent has not complied with these standards. To the extent that she has alleged general error in our prior decision, this is not a proper basis for a motion to reconsider. See id. The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge failed to comply with his duty to establish the record. See section 240(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(1); Yang v. McElroy, 277 F.3d 158, 162 (2d Cir. 2002). However, we are not persuaded that we erroneously overlooked this issue in our prior decision, at which time the respondent was represented by her former counsel Alexander Lumelsky, Esquire. While an Immigration Judge has an obligation to establish the record, it is the respondent’s burden to establish her eligibility for the relief of adjustment of status. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). We reaffirm our holding that the Immigration Judge acted reasonably and within his discretion in affording the respondent 3 months to marshal the evidence necessary to support her claim, and denying a continuance when she failed to do so. The absence of any evidence of the bona fides of the respondent’s marriage was not a result of the Immigration Judge’s failure to develop the record, but of the respondent’s failure to exercise due diligence in satisfying her burden of proof. Therefore, the motion to reconsider is denied.
 
*2 Concerning the motion to reopen, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), in which we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The claimant must also establish prejudice resulting from his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that the alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
In this case, the respondent has not complied with the first prong of Matter of Lozada. While her supporting documentation contains two personal unsworn statements, neither of these is an “affidavit.” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (8th ed. 2004). Furthermore, she has not set forth in detail the agreement entered into with Mr. Lumelsky concerning the actions to be taken and what representations he did or did not make in this regard. In fact, a letter from Mr. Lumelsky in the respondent’s documentation informs her that “¿aºs we discussed, you must provide me with evidence of your life together with your husband from the date of your marriage until the hearing,” and “if I do not receive any documentation from you and your husband by March 1, 2005, I will withdraw as your attorney.” The letter further instructs the respondent to file a motion with the Immigration Court with “your Philadelphia attorney” if she desired to have venue transferred to Philadelphia. These representations call into doubt the respondent’s assertion that Mr. Lumelsky told her that she could either bring the required evidence 10 days before the hearing or to the hearing itself. Moreover, the respondent has provided no evidence of prejudice, as required to prevail on the instant motion. The respondent has raised no argument concerning her eligibility for adjustment of status in her motions and the only evidence of record tending to establish the bona fides of her marriage was submitted by Mr. Lumelsky in connection with the appeal. As this evidence is outdated, it is insufficient to show a bona fide marriage and thus demonstrate prejudice. For these reasons, the motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel is denied.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motions are denied.

March 31, 2008
 
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Desmond P. FitzGerald, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)º - Conditional resident status terminated
 
  
APPLICATION: Waiver under section 212(c)(4); remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals from the January 8, 2008, decision of the Immigration Judge denying her motion to reconsider. The Immigration Judge initially ordered the respondent removed on July 27, 2007, After the respondent failed to submit proof to the court that she had filed a Form 1-751, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had abandoned any available relief and ordered the respondent removed to Lithuania.¿FN1º The respondent moved to reopen, arguing that her prior counsel had been ineffective in failing to timely file the Form 1-751. The Immigration Judge denied that motion on December 20, 2007, because the respondent failed to submit proof that she had filed the 1-751, had not met the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel set out in Mailer of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), and was not eligible to adjust her status based on her marriage to her current husband. The respondent then filed a motion to reconsider before the Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reconsider Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reconsider on January 8, 2008, finding that she had not identified any defects in the prior decision. It is from that decision that the respondent now appeals.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that she did not abandon her application for relief, that she has met the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, and that she is eligible to petition for a hardship waiver pursuant to section 216(c)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4). The DHS has not submitted a brief in this case.
 
A motion to reconsider requests that the original decision be reexamined in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2) (2007) a (“motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s prior decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority”).
 
Preliminarily, the record establishes that the respondent has met the requirements set out in Matter of Lozada, supra, for ineffective assistance of counsel claims (Attachments to Respondent’s January 7, 2008 Motion to Reconsider). In addition, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent could not adjust her status based on her current marriage to a United States citizen because she entered the United States on a fiance visa based on her engagement to her first husband. The Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits the adjustment of status from a fiance visa under section 101(a)(l 5)(K), except as a result of a marriage to the same the citizen who filed the fiance petition. Section 245(d) of the Act. The record does not contain evidence that the respondent entered the United States with a fiance visa, but if that is the case, then the Immigration Judge’s ruling regarding adjustment of status is correct.
 
*2 In her motions to reopen and to reconsider, however, the respondent does not seek adjustment of status through her current husband; instead, she seeks a hardship waiver to remove the conditional basis of her permanent resident status based on her marriage to her first United States citizen husband. See section 216(c)(4) of the Act. The Immigration Judge did not address this aspect of the respondent’s case in her December 20, 2007, decision. Accordingly, we find that a remand is appropriate for consideration of the respondent’s eligibility for any relief.
 
The record is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Luisito Lopez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Terry M. Louie
Senior Litigation Counsel
 
CHARGE:
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on January 22, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen in absentia proceedings. In doing so, the Board found the respondent had received appropriate notice of his hearing. On December 14, 2007, the respondent submitted a “motion to reconsider,” asking the Board to sua sponte reopen proceedings as he avers he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion is denied.
 
We initially note the respondent’s motion is incorrectly titled, as its true nature is one seeking reopening.¿FN1º A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based on the previous factual record, as opposed to a motion to reopen, which seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 403 (BIA 1991); see also section 240(c)(7)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) and Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Here, the respondent does not allege the Board committed error based on the record before us at the time of our prior decision. Rather, he contends prior counsel afforded him ineffective assistance by failing to include with his first motion to reopen the original envelope for his hearing notice, although he had given the same to her. With his motion he has provided evidence he did not previously submit, including affidavits from himself and a former landlady, and a March 5, 2007, letter from former counsel.
 
The respondent’s motion is time-barred as it was filed more than 90 days after the Board’s decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, as the Department of Homeland Security notes in its opposition, the respondent has not complied with any of the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). We appreciate that former counsel indicated in her letter that the respondent had “exhausted the appeals,” however without further inquiry it is unclear whether she referred to his available appeals within the administrative system, whether he had exhausted the level of appeals available pursuant to their representation agreement, or if she truly did not appreciate he could appeal to the federal circuit court. As the respondent did not inform former counsel of his allegations against her, she has had no opportunity to clarify what she meant in her letter. Former counsel’s mistaken referral to a “motion to reconsider” when discussing the requirements for a motion to reopen is also not per se evidence of ineffective assistance. As noted, current counsel has made a similar such mistake. Moreover, there is no indication that a motion to reconsider was supportable at that time as, to date, the respondent has not demonstrated the Board committed any error in our prior decision¿FN2º. Similarly, the respondent has not indicated he had informed Ms. Baquero he had any “additional information” which would have supported a motion to reopen. As such, although her reference to the nature of the motion was in error, he has not shown he had provided her with evidence supporting a second motion to reopen.¿FN3º Since the respondent has not informed Ms. Baquero of his allegations against her, he has not afforded her an opportunity to respond to his claim that he, in fact, provided her with the envelope bearing the hearing notice and she failed to file the same with his motion. Ms. Baquero’s letter makes no reference to this document. Without more, the respondent has not shown he was provided with ineffective assistance of counsel, and reopening is not warranted.¿FN4º
 
*2 In closing, we do not find that the facts presented represent exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of our sua sponte authority to reopen. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (Board retains limited discretionary power under the regulations to reopen or reconsider only in exceptional circumstances); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). In addition, we decline to exercise our discretionary authority to reopen as the record demonstrates the respondent was ordered excluded in 1995, and admitted he reentered the United States in 1996 without lawful authorization (Forms I-213, I-831). He also admitted departing and returning to this country several times thereafter, also without lawful authorization. Moreover, the record contains evidence indicating he was involved in the unlawful smuggling of two aliens into the United States (Forms I-213, I-831; Minn. Dept. of Public Safety, Field Report, 1/5/06). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

This error is ironic given that current counsel, who submitted the erroneously titled motion before us, cites as evidence of prior counsel’s incompetence her mistaken reference to a “motion to reconsider” when stating the requirements for a motion to reopen.

2

The respondent does not contend he never received notice. Rather, he avers the same was untimely delivered to his then-residence (Motion at 5-7).

3

We observe the respondent and his landlady’s affidavits are not “new” evidence as they could have been previously provided. He has not explained why he did not file the same with his first motion.

4

The respondent also has not provided details regarding why it took so long for him to file the instant motion (almost eleven months after the Board’s decision). In his affidavit he merely states he “retained” instant counsel, without identifying when he first contacted Mr. Lopez, and what efforts he undertook during the more than ten intervening months following the Board’s decision and prior to the submission of the motion at issue.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David L. Wilson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Darrin E. Hetfield
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on November 26, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent has timely filed a motion to reopen the proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has indicated its opposition to reopening. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent seeks reopening in order to allow her to present testimony from her first husband, Anthony Toan Ly, regarding the bona fides of their former marriage. The respondent claims that she received ineffective assistance from her former attorney, who she claims rebuffed her repeated suggestions that she should contact Mr. Ly to ask him to testify on her behalf. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent asserts that Mr. Ly’s testimony will validate her claim that she and Mr. Ly married for love, and not in order to circumvent the immigration laws, and that the termination of the marriage was through no fault of her own. The respondent has proffered affidavits from herself as well as Mr. Ly.
 
Pursuant to the Board’s holding in Matter of Lozada, supra, the respondent informed former counsel of the allegations made against him. In a letter written in response to the respondent’s allegations, former counsel states that he did in fact ask the respondent to provide Mr. Ly’s address and whereabouts to his office from the beginning of the proceeding. However, the respondent never provided the address but stated that Mr. Ly had gone to Canada with another woman.
 
We find that reopening is unwarranted. The respondent has not shown that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent’s contention that former counsel rejected her suggestions to procure Mr. Ly’s testimony is unworthy of belief in view of the many inconsistencies between the respondent’s affidavit and that of Mr. Ly; the inconsistencies between the affidavits and the testimony given by the respondent under oath at the January 31, 2006, hearing; and former counsel’s statement that he had asked the respondent to provide Mr. Ly’s address, but she did not do so.
 
The respondent states in her affidavit that she told her attorney on at least two occasions prior to the January 2006 hearing that she believed Mr. Ly would be willing to appear in court to testify on her behalf. However, this conflicts with the respondent’s testimony that she does not want to contact Mr. Ly because she knows that he lives with another woman in Canada, and she does not think that he would come to court and explain what happened to their relationship if she did contact him (Tr. at 59). Additionally, the respondent’s statement in her affidavit that Mr. Ly’s mother had told her she had Mr. Ly’s telephone number after the respondent called her following the first master calendar hearing conflicts with the respondent’s testimony that she does not know where to find Mr. Ly and was only told that he lived with “that woman” in Canada when she telephoned his friend (Tr. at 58-59).
 
*2 Mr. Ly’s affidavit also conflicts with the respondent’s testimony as well as her affidavit. Mr. Ly states that he had contact with the respondent from time to time, and she had told him that “she had an interview and later that she had court”. He further states that he wrote a letter to the respondent’s former counsel and would have gone to her hearing, but the respondent explained that former counsel did not want her there. These statements are inconsistent both with the respondent’s January 31, 2006, testimony that she had not talked to Mr. Ly since December 1999 and did not know where to find him (Tr. at 58) and with the allegations in her affidavit that she was given Mr. Ly’s telephone number by his mother, and subsequently telephoned him and told him of her situation, only after the Immigration Judge entered his order granting her voluntary departure.
 
The letter from former counsel in response to the allegations made against him as well as the respondent’s testimony suggest that the respondent herself made the decision not to procure the testimony of her former husband at proceedings below and then regretted that decision after the Immigration Judge rendered his decision. We do not find that the respondent’s former counsel provided ineffective assistance, nor do we find that the respondent’s proffer constitutes material new evidence which was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the hearing below. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Therefore, the respondent has not met the regulatory requirements for reopening.
 
Finally, it appears that Mr. Ly’s testimony would not have bolstered the respondent’s claims regarding the bona fides of her former marriage but would only have further undermined them. Mr. Ly’s statement that he and the respondent began arguing “¿iºn the spring season of 2000” is inconsistent with the respondent’s January 2006 testimony that she last talked with Mr. Ly in December 1999. Additionally, Mr. Ly’s statement that the respondent’s sister began telling her that he was messing around with the sister’s female employee, whom he had been talking to since early 2000, is inconsistent with the respondent’s testimony that her brother and sister had told her of the woman in June 1999 and that Mr. Ly had met her prior to the respondent’s February 1999 arrival in the United States (Tr. at 54-55).
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brenda C. Diaz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Catherine Halliday-Roberts
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Continuance
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent’s timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 2, 2008, finding the respondent removable, as charged, based on the respondent’s admissions and concessions of removability (Tr. at 14) as to his 2006 California receiving of stolen property conviction, which he found to be an aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(G)of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G); finding he had not demonstrated his eligibility for any for relief from removal (Tr. at 15), and ordering his removal to Mexico, will be dismissed.
 
The only issue raised on appeal is the respondent’s contention that his former attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to request a continuance from the Immigration Court while concomitantly pursuing a post-conviction motion to set aside and vacate the respondent’s 2006 California receiving of stolen property conviction, which underpins the charges of removability, and his eligibility for relief from removal.
 
We find no merit to the contentions raised by the respondent on appeal. To the extent the respondent alleges ineffective assistance by former counsel, we note that in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), we laid out the requirements that a respondent must meet in order to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Here, the respondent has failed to comply with any of the established requirements to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Moreover, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra. The record reflects the respondent’s former attorney, after considering the respondent’s entire criminal record which included two probation violations with additional time beyond the original 365 days of his sentence, indicated to the Immigration Judge that, in her professional judgement, it would not be fruitful to pursue any post-conviction relief in this case (Tr. at 15). The respondent has presented no arguments on appeal that would challenge that assessment. We recognize that the present case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has held that rigid adherence to the procedural requirements established in Lozada is not always necessary. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir 2000). However, where the respondent has failed to comply with any of the Lozada requirements and where the respondent has also failed to show any prejudice, we are compelled to deny his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Assaad, supra.
 
*2 Moreover, the decision to grant or deny a continuance is in the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown. See Matter of Luviano-Rodriguez, 21 I&N Dec. 235, 237 (BIA 1996); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). That decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing. See Matter of Luviano-Rodriguez, supra at 237; Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec.433 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.6. There is no indication in the record that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing. An Immigration Judge presented with a facially valid charge of removability need not hold removal proceedings in abeyance based on the mere possibility that a collateral criminal proceeding could have a future impact on the alien’s immigration status. See Contreras v. Schiltgen, 122 F.3d 30, 33-34 (9th Cir. 1997), affd on add’l grounds in Contreras v. Schiltgen, 151 F.3d 906 (9th Cir.1998) (Contreras II) (the court found that the “validity of ¿the alien’sº California conviction can only be tested in an action against the state, which has the greatest interest in preserving its judgment and the best ability to either correct or defend it … and … ¿uºntil ¿the alienº has successfully overturned his conviction in such a proceeding, the ¿Immigration Judgeº is entitled to rely on the conviction as a basis for custody and eventual deportation.”).
 
The respondent raises no arguments on appeal which were not addressed by the Immigration Judge or which would cause us to reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision. Based on the record before us, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is subject to removal from the United States, as charged, based on the respondent’s concessions of removability (Tr. at 14). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c) (2007). Moreover, the respondent has failed to establish his eligibility for any relief from removal. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: MARIA SACARIAS DE PINEDO

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio Salazar, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Olga El-Bogdadi
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated December 20, 2007, which dismissed her appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act as a lawful permanent resident, and denied a motion to remand based on allegations of ineffective assistance of former counsel. In so doing, we found that the respondent not only failed to meet any of the requirements for properly asserting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, but also did not show that she had been actually prejudiced by ineffective assistance. The motion to reopen is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security.
 
The respondent claims that reopening is warranted as she received ineffective assistance of former counsel before the Immigration Judge. A party who seeks to reopen proceedings to pursue relief previously considered bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated that an inquiry into whether counsel provided ineffective assistance must begin by determining whether competent counsel would have acted otherwise before examining whether an alien was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective actions of counsel. See Maravilla-Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9 th Cir. 2004). Counsel’s actions must have rendered the proceedings fundamentally unfair such that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting her case. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003). In addition, “substantial prejudice” must be established and such prejudice means that an alien must show that the alleged ineffectiveness affected the outcome of proceedings. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, supra; Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241,1246 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
In support of reopening, the respondent submits a sworn personal declaration and indicates that a copy of the motion and declaration were being sent to her former attorney to allow him an opportunity to respond. However, the respondent has not established that she notified the former counsel of the allegations made against him and gave him an opportunity to respond. Also, the respondent has not indicated whether she filed a bar complaint against former counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Compliance with the Lozada requirements is not optional where there is not an obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel on the record. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598-99 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent continues to assert that had her case been properly prepared and presented the Immigration Judge would have granted the relief she sought. However, the respondent, who asserts that her United States citizen children should have been called as witnesses, has not shown what testimony they would have presented or that it would have affected the outcome of the proceedings. Similarly, she has not shown how additional preparation would have altered the adverse credibility finding below. Consequently, we find that the respondent has not established that any alleged ineffective assistance she may have received caused substantial prejudice. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Leonel Torres, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Angela A. Crider
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before the Board on January 27, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen. We found that the respondent received proper notice of her hearing and she failed to establish exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear. On May 18, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen before the Board. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
In her motion, the respondent requests that the Board consider the additional facts and evidence supporting the respondent’s claim that she did not receive proper notice of the hearing. The respondent contends that there was improper notice because the address listed on the Notification Requirement for Change of Address lists the wrong address for the respondent, and the transcript of the Immigration Judge’s decision also indicates an incorrect address for the respondent.
 
The respondent is correct that the Notification Requirement for Change of Address (Form I-830) lists an incorrect apartment number for the respondent, and the transcript of the January 29, 2001, proceedings reflects a typographical error regarding the respondent’s apartment number.¿FN1º Tr. at 2. However, both of these errors are harmless and irrelevant, as the notice of hearing dated November 15, 2000, was sent to the respondent at the most recent address she provided. The record reflects that on November 1, 2000, the respondent filed a motion to change venue, indicating that she resided at 7500 Plum Creek Apt. #4237, Houston, TX 77012. On November 14, 2000, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s motion to change venue. The order was sent to the respondent at the Plum Creek address, but it was returned to the Houston Immigration Court as undeliverable. Furthermore, on November 15, 2000, the Houston Immigration Court sent a notice of hearing to the respondent at the following address: C/O Elvis Tsikis, 7500 Plum Creek Apt. #4237, Houston, TX 77012. The envelope was returned to the Immigration Court with the handwritten notation “MLNA.” The respondent failed to appear for the hearing on January 29, 2001, and was ordered removed in absentia. The in absentia order also was returned to the Houston Immigration Court with a label indicating “No Forward Order On File - Unable to Forward - Return to Sender.” The Immigration Judge indicated that the notation “MLNA” is customary to reflect “moved, left no address.” See I.J. Dec, dated October 17, 2003, at 2.
 
In her prior motion before the Immigration Court, the respondent claimed that in February 2001, she moved to a new address: 5825 Delaney Rd., #603, Hitchcock, Texas 77563. However, the record contains a Biographic Information Form (Form G-325), dated September 27, 2002, indicating that she began residing at that address in October 2000. Furthermore, the Immigration Judge’s order granting the change of venue motion, the hearing notice dated November 15, 2000, and the in absentia order dated January 29, 2001, were all returned to the Houston Immigration Court as undeliverable, and all of the returned envelopes indicated that the respondent had moved and left no forwarding address. This raises the question whether the respondent moved prior to November 2000, but failed to inform the Immigration Court immediately of her change of address, as required. The respondent received proper notice of her hearing, as it was mailed to the most recent address provided by the respondent and she failed to keep the Immigration Court apprised of her correct address.
 
*2 The respondent now claims for the first time that she failed to appear for her hearing due to ineffective assistance of counsel. She asserts that her prior counsel failed to notify her regarding the transfer of venue and the hearing on January 29, 2001. The respondent states that her prior counsel only provided her with a hearing notice dated September 20, 2000, for a hearing on March 30, 2001. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the alien has satisfied the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent has not complied with any of the requirements set forth in Lozada. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joyce A. Phipps, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jorge A. Ramos
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration and reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, from Ecuador, moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider and reopen¿FN1º our decision. On May 26, 1994, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent deported in absentia when she failed to appear at a hearing. On March 8, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied a motion to reopen. On April 14, 2006, we dismissed the appeal of the denied motion to reopen. On November 2, 2007, we denied a motion to reopen which raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel and requested equitable tolling for the time limits on motions to reopen. The instant motion will be denied.
 
In our April 14, 2006, decision, we specifically agreed with the Immigration Judge that the respondent had not established that she failed to appear at the hearing before the Immigration Judge due to lack of notice or other exceptional circumstances. In our November 2, 2007, decision, we concluded that the respondent’s argument that the time limits on motions to reopen should be equitably tolled must fail because, during the nearly 10 year period between the Immigration Judge decision and the filing of the first motion, the respondent had not acted with due diligence. See Boakai v. Gonzales, 447 F.3d 1, 3 n.3 (1st Cir. 2006); Jobe v. INS, 238 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2001); Cai Xing Chen v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 151, 154, n 3 (1st Cir. 2005).
 
The instant motion now claims that the respondent was told by 3 attorneys to wait instead of pursuing her case. However, the previous motion filed with the Board complained only about Attorney Manzo, who first represented the respondent while these proceedings were pending. There was no specific complaint alleged or substantiated with regard to the Attorney Napolitano, who filed the motion before the Immigration Judge and represented the respondent on appeal, or with regard to any other counsel.
 
There is no adequate explanation in the instant motion as to why allegations of ineffectiveness were not made against all of the prior attorneys, rather than just the first attorney, in the earlier motion. No evidence of compliance with the procedural or substantive requirements to establish ineffective assistance of counsel claims against any of these other attorneys has been provided. See Lawrence v. Gonzales, 446 F.3d 221, 226 (1st Cir. 2006); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 A motion to reconsider must include the following: (1) an allegation of material factual or legal errors in the prior decision that is supported by pertinent authority; (2) in the case of an affirmance without opinion (“AWO”), a showing that the alleged errors and legal arguments were previously raised on appeal and a statement explaining how the Board erred in affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision under the AWO regulations; and (3) if there has been a change in law, a reference to the relevant statute, regulation, or precedent and an explanation of how the outcome of the Board’s decision is materially affected by the change. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
Insofar as the motion requests reconsideration of our April 14, 2006, decision on appeal, the motion was not filed until November 30, 2007. The motion is untimely and does not establish an exception. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Insofar as the motion requests reconsideration of our November 2, 2007, decision, the argument in the motion merely disagrees with our conclusion, but does not establish errors of fact or law supported by pertinent authority, or cite to changed law, that would warrant granting the motion. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra. Insofar as the motion attempts to argue new facts, these are not substantiated by any objective evidence. Furthermore, the respondent does not explain why these facts were not introduced in the earlier motion to reopen denied by the Board. 8 C.F.R § 1003.2(c). Accordingly, the motion is denied. The request for a stay is also denied.

APPLICATION: Reconsideration and reopening
 
This matter was last before the Board on November 7, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s June 8, 2006, decision denying a continuance of proceedings. The respondent now moves to reconsider and reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must be filed within 30 days of the Board’s decision and assert that the Board made a factual or legal error at the time it rendered the previous decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b) (2003); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991), aff’d, 979 F.2d 212 (11th Cir. 1992) (table case). The respondent acknowledges that his motion is untimely but notes that his former attorney did not notify him of the Board’s decision in time to seek reconsideration. Even if timely, the respondent failed to allege any legal or factual error by the Board in our prior order to support reconsideration. Thus, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
The respondent also seeks to reopen proceedings to pursue an application for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(i)ofthe Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). With respect to the new evidence submitted in conjunction with the instant motion to reopen, we find that this evidence could have been presented at the hearing before the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) (providing that a motion to reopen shall be supported by new evidence that is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented previously). The respondent argues in his motion, however, that his prior counsel “failed to investigate and submit evidence either to the IJ or BIA that Respondent is grandfathered under U.S.C. § 245(i) of the LIFE Act.” If the respondent is alleging a claim of ineffective assistance by his former counsel, he has failed to comply with any of the requirements for asserting such a claim outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637(BIA 1988).¿FN1º See Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498, 501 (7th Cir. 2001) (recognizes Board’s authority to rule and analyze cases within the Lozada framework). Moreover, regardless of the respondent’s claim of derivative status as a grandfathered alien under section 245(i) of the Act, as we noted in our prior decision, the respondent failed to present evidence that his I-130 petition has been approved or that an immigrant visa is immediately available to him. Thus, the motion to reopen will be denied.

IN RE: GLORIA HERNANDEZ DE DIAZ

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher Duran, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jesus Clemente
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated July 18, 2007, the Board of Immigration Appeals denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen and reconsider. The respondent’s motion will be granted and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen and reconsider is both untimely and number barred. The respondent requests equitable tolling based on the ineffective assistance of former counsel (Patricia Vargas). The respondent shows substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to allege ineffective assistance of former counsel. The respondent presents a detailed affidavit and a copy of the attorney complaint form filed with the California State Bar. Although the respondent did not write a letter directly to Ms. Vargas, the certificate of service for the respondent’s motion states that a copy of the motion and attachments was sent to Ms. Vargas, thus giving her an opportunity to respond to the allegations against her.
 
The respondent shows sufficient prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (holding that the alien did not establish that his former counsel’s failure to file a timely appeal constituted sufficient prejudice to warrant consideration of his late appeal on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel). The respondent offers documents (which Ms. Vargas did not present in support of the two motions she filed for the respondent) which indicate the respondent’s husband filed for legalization, her daughter filed for benefits under the Family Unity Program (FUP), and her husband received two receipts for fees paid for two FUP applications. These documents do not prove that the respondent was granted FUP status. The respondent and her husband, however, submit their respective declarations. The respondent states that she applied for derivative FUP status through her husband in 1991. The respondent’s husband states that his FUP application for his wife was granted. In Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, 298 F.3d 888, 892 (9th Cir. 2002), the court stated that facts presented in affidavits supporting a motion to reopen must be accepted as true unless inherently unbelievable. Under the circumstances present here, it is not “inherently unbelievable” that the respondent was granted FUP status. Depending on if and when FUP status was granted, when combined with the respondent’s admission as a lawful permanent resident in May of 2000, she may meet the 7 year continuous residence (after having been admitted in any status) requirement in section 240A(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(2), and thus be eligible for cancellation of removal. See Garcia-Quintero v. Gonzales, 455 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that acceptance into FUP constitutes being “admitted in any status” for the purposes of section 240A(a)(2) of the Act).
 
*2 The respondent shows due diligence. See generally Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that the limitation period may be tolled until the alien meets with new counsel to discuss his file, thereby becoming aware of the harm resulting from the misconduct of his prior representatives). The second motion by Ms. Vargas was denied on July 18, 2007. The respondent retained present counsel on July 27, 2007, filled out the attorney complaint form on August 15, 2007, executed her declaration on August 20, 2007, and filed the present motion on August 27, 2007. Due diligence has been shown.
 
On remand both parties may submit further evidence regarding whether the respondent was granted FUP status, and if so, when she was granted such status. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.

IN RE: DEXTER LANCELOT RODNEY A.K.A. RODNEY DEXTER A.K.A. DEXTER RODNOY
FILE: AXX XX7 175 - YORK, PA
March 6, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sandra Greene, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Termination
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s November 6, 2007, decision finding him removable under section 237(a)(2XA)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. He also moves to remand, asserting that his trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance in conceding his removability (Tr. at 20-21). The Department of Homeland Security has not filed an appeal brief or a response to the motion to remand. The motion will be granted, and the case will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The respondent has complied with the evidentiary requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).¿FN1º SeeLu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 132 (3rd Cir. 2001) (approving the Lozada requirements). In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance, the Third Circuit has stated that an alien “must demonstrate prejudice, he ‘must show that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.”’ Ponce-Leiva v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 369, 377 (3rd Cir. 2002), citing Uspango v. Asheroft, 289 F.3d 226, 231 (3rd Cir. 2002).
 
We conclude that the respondent has established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We find that a competent attorney would have challenged the respondent’s removability based on the aggravated felony charge listed in the Notice to Appear. As the respondent outlines in his appeal brief, there are arguable issues as to whether the DHS met its burden of establishing that the respondent’s bank fraud conviction involved a loss to a victim or victims exceeding $10,000 to constitute an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(M) of the Act. Because the respondent “was prevented from reasonably presenting his case,” we find that he established the requisite prejudice to support a remand for a hearing on removability. See Ponce-Leiva v. Ashcroft, supra.
 
Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s November 6, 2007, decision will be vacated, the motion to remand will be granted, and the case remanded to Immigration Court for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s November 6, 2007, decision is hereby vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Adam S. Elman, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(l)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)º - Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
In a decision dated November 1, 2006, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent has appealed that decision. The appeal is dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed on September 8, 2005, more than 90 days after the respondent was ordered removed on July 2, 2001. See 8C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Moreover, the Immigration Judge did not find that exceptional circumstances were present, even if such circumstances could justify the untimeliness of the respondent’s motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent failed to demonstrate that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, because he did not satisfy any of the procedural requirements for attorney negligence as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1stCir. 1988), nor has he explained his failure to do so (I.J. at 4, 5). Failure to meet the Lozada requirements will usually be fatal to the claim. See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996) (discussion of policy considerations underlying Lozada requirements); aff’d Rivera v. INS, 122 F. 3d 1062 (4th Cir. 1997). The respondent refers to the Ninth Circuit case, Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000), and contends that strict adherence to the Lozada requirements is not required when the record of ineffective assistance of counsel is legitimate and substantial. At the outset, we note that this case arises in the jurisdiction of the First Circuit, and the respondent has not shown that the First Circuit has adopted the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit in Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra. The First Circuit has held that the Lozada requirements may be applied as long as the court does not arbitrarily demand adherence to them. Saakian v. INS, 252 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2001); I.J. at 4.¿FN1º Here, the failure to satisfy any of the Lozada requirements is fatal to this claim. Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 2004). Because the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed untimely, the appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Victoria Calle, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Corine Dominguez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision dated December 6, 2007. Therein, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his motion to reopen an order of removal entered in absentia on June 29, 1999. The record will be remanded.
 
A motion to reconsider is a “request that the Board reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked.” Matter of Ramos, 23 I&N Dec. 336, 338 (BIA 2002) (quoting Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 n.2 (BIA 1991)). A motion to reconsider challenges the Board’s original decision and alleges that it is defective in some regard. Matter of Cerna, supra, at 402. A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based on the previous factual record, as opposed to a motion to reopen, which seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. Id at 403; see also section 240(c)(7)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) and Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
The respondent argues in his motion that the Board incorrectly concluded that he was notified of the hearing. He states that his former counsel withdrew as his representative on May 19, 1999, and that he did not receive a notice of hearing either from his former counsel or from the court. The respondent further argues that there is no proof that the Immigration Court actually mailed the Notice of Hearing to him. In addition, the respondent argues in his motion that the Board incorrectly determined that he failed to satisfy the procedural requirements for showing ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). He contends that former counsel was notified of the complaint filed against him with the Texas Bar Association as a part of the bar complaint process.
 
We find in light of the allegation of non-receipt of the hearing notice that it is appropriate to remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge to more fully address whether the respondent was adequately notified of the hearing. See Maknojiya v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 588, 589 (5th Cir. 2005) (noting the lower burden required for rebutting the presumption of delivery for correspondence sent by regular mail was met where both alien and his counsel submitted affidavits indicating that they did not receive the notice that reset the hearing from an earlier hearing date than originally scheduled). In addition, the record reflects that the Immigration Judge did not address the issue of whether the respondent was victimized by the negligence of his former counsel, Mr. Rosenbloom. We find it appropriate for the Immigration Judge to render the initial findings of fact on the issue.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is granted, and these proceedings are remanded for further proceedings.

CHARGE:

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Cameroon, appeals an Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 21, 2006. On August 4, 2006, the respondent failed to appear for a hearing pursuant to a notice mailed to his address on June 22, 2006, and the Immigration Judge ordered him removed to Cameroon in absentia (I.J. at 2). On September 1, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to rescind the removal order and reopen proceedings with the Immigration Judge alleging that he failed to appear for the Immigration Court hearing due to a lack of notice. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). Following the Immigration Judge’s September 21, 2006, denial of the respondent’s motion, the respondent filed a timely appeal with the Board. The request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). The respondent’s appeal will be sustained and the removal proceedings will be reopened.
 
As an initial matter, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion upon concluding that the respondent failed to show — either through an affidavit or other evidence — that he did not receive notice of the August 4, 2006, hearing (I.J. at 2-3). Although the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent did not rebut the presumption of effective delivery, we find that the removal order should be rescinded. First, we note that the respondent initiated correspondence with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as a result of his prior submission of his asylum application, which was confirmed by the DHS arresting officer in his notation in the Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien. As a result, the respondent arguably had little motive to avoid the scheduled hearing (Respondent’s Br. at 1, 6). See generally Lopes v. Gonzales, 468 F.3d 81, 86 (2d Cir. 2006) (remanding, in part, because the Board did not consider all relevant evidence offered to rebut the presumption of delivery, including the fact that the petitioner — through the filing of an application for a labor certification — initiated a proceeding to obtain a benefit, which makes it less likely that he would ignore, or have such motive to, an immigration proceeding for which he had notice); see also Alrefae v. Chertoff, 471 F.3d 353, 359 (2d Cir. 2006). Also, the respondent did not delay in seeking a reopening of the proceedings as he, upon receiving the in absentia removal order, apparently retained Mr. Mark Kenmore as his counsel, who filed the motion on September 1, 2006.
 
*2 In addition, while not discussed in the Immigration Judge’s decision, the DHS in this matter did not oppose the respondent’s motion to rescind the removal order and reopen proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 2). Indeed, as evidenced through the DHS’s statement on appeal, it continues to assert its non-opposition to the respondent’s motion (Respondent’s Br. at 3, 6). Moreover, as indicated in the respondent’s brief, the respondent’s prior attorney, Mr. Kenmore, may have rendered ineffective assistance to the respondent prior to his withdrawal of the case (Respondent’s Br. at 3-4). Although the respondent has not satisfied the procedural requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, he suggests that such defective representation is apparent from the record as Mr. Kenmore — despite suffering from cognitive difficulties and memory problems and being under the care of a neurologist since June 2006 — continued to represent the respondent before the Immigration Judge and the Board. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Also, the respondent offers the fact that no supporting documentation was provided with the motion to the Immigration Judge as further evidence of such inadequate representation.¿FN1º
 
Therefore, we will sustain the respondent’s appeal, vacate the Immigration Judge’s decision, and rescind the in absentia order. As we find that the proceedings should be reopened, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings as may be appropriate under the circumstances. See Matter of Patel, 16 I&N Dec. 600 (BIA 1978). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is hereby remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Geoffrey A. Hoffman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Section 212(c) waiver
 
This case was last before us on May 28, 2003, when we remanded the record of proceedings to the Immigration Judge to consider the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), in light of INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). On February 13, 2007, the Immigration Judge pretermitted the respondent’s application for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act. The respondent now appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 13, 2007, decision. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand in order to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) filed an opposition to the respondent’s motion to remand. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and his motion to remand will be denied. Additionally, the respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7).
 
On appeal, the respondent does not contest that he was convicted by a jury for the offense of criminal possession of marijuana in the fourth degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree. Instead, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge was bound by the law of our May 28, 2003, remand to consider his application for section 212(c) relief. The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge erred by holding that he is ineligible for section 212(c) relief because he was convicted pursuant to a jury trial, rather than pursuant to a guilty plea. Additionally, the respondent raises due process arguments. In his motion to remand, the respondent contends that his proceedings should be remanded to the Immigration Judge so that he can apply for relief under section 212(h) of the Act.
 
Turning first to the respondent’s application for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent is ineligible for section 212(c) relief (I. J. at 2). Specifically, we find that the respondent’s conviction by jury trial does not fall within the ambit of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001) (holding that the repeal of section 212(c) of the Act by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (“IIRIRA”) could not be applied retroactively to aliens who pled guilty or nolo contendere to a crime prior to IIRIRA’s enactment). See Alexandre v. United States Attorney General 452 F.3d 1204, 1207 (11th Cir. 2006) (finding that a section 212(c) waiver was precluded because the alien had proceeded to trial and was convicted by jury). To the extent that the respondent relies on the decisions in other federal courts of appeal that have found that section 212(c) relief may be available to aliens who were convicted after a jury trial, we find that those decisions are not binding on the present matter as they did not arise in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (the “Eleventh Circuit’), the jurisdiction in which this case arises. See Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25, 31 (BIA 1989) (explaining that the Board historically follows a court’s precedent in cases arising in that circuit). Moreover, we reject the respondent’s contention on appeal that the Eleventh Circuit has only issued decisions containing non-binding dicta indicating that relief under former section 212(c) of the Act is unavailable to aliens who have been convicted pursuant to a jury trial. See Alexandre v. United States Attorney General, supra, at 1207. We also reject the respondent’s assertion on appeal that the law of the case doctrine forbad the Immigration Judge from pretermitting his application for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act. Although we remanded the record of proceedings to the Immigration Judge to consider the respondent’s application for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act in light of INS v. St. Cyr, supra, the respondent concedes on appeal that our remand was based on a conviction document that erroneously indicated that he had been convicted pursuant to a guilty plea. See respondent’s motion to remand at pg. 3, n.1. In this regard, we reject the respondent’s argument on appeal that it was incumbent upon the DHS to determine prior to our remand that the respondent had been convicted pursuant to a jury trial rather than pursuant to a guilty plea. Furthermore, to the extent that the respondent argues that the relevant law as applied to him is unconstitutional, we have no jurisdiction over the constitutionality of the statutes and regulations we administer. See Matter of C-, 20 I&N Dec. 529, 532 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Turning next to the respondent’s motion to remand, we find that remand of proceedings is not warranted. With his motion to remand, the respondent has submitted an application for relief under section 212(h) of the Act, as well as supporting documentation. We find that the respondent has not adequately demonstrated that the proffered evidence with his motion to remand was not previously available or could not have been presented during his hearing before the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1002.3(c)(1), (c)(4); see generally Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547 (BIA 1992) (providing that an alien seeking reopening based on a failure to request relief before the completion of deportation proceedings must meet the general motion requirements). Moreover, we note that, even if the Immigration Judge failed to advise the respondent of his right to apply for relief under section 212(h) of the Act during the initial proceedings, as argued by the respondent in his motion, the respondent was nonetheless aware of the possibility for such relief during the remanded proceedings and still failed to apply at that time (Tr. at 16-17). To the extent that the respondent claims that his failure to request relief under section 212(h) of the Act before the Immigration Judge was the result of ineffective assistance by his counsel, he has made no attempt to comply with the procedural requirements set forth under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered:

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Albert Chow, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s May 10, 2007, decision denying her¿FN1º motion to rescind the order of removal entered in her case on an in absentia basis. We have considered the respondent’s appellate arguments as set forth on her Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26), her statement attached thereto, and in her subsequently-filed brief. Inasmuch as we agree with the Immigration Judge’s resolution of this case, we adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, with the exception of the discussion found on pages 5 and 6 suggesting frivolous behavior on the part of the respondent’s current attorney. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994).
 
On appeal, the respondent’s current attorney asserts that the respondent’s supporting declaration sufficiently establishes that she did not receive notice of her March 5, 2007, hearing from her former attorney. See Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26); Respondent’s Brief on Appeal. We disagree. In that declaration, the respondent indicates only that upon her release from detention she provided her new address in New Jersey to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and to the Immigration Court. She makes no specific claims of having provided this address to her former attorney, Ronald Higgins,¿FN2º having kept in touch with attorney Higgins, or that attorney Higgins failed to apprise her that a hearing would be conducted in her case on March 5, 2007. See Exh. 8 (Motion, attached declaration).
 
There also is no indication that prior to the March 5th proceeding attorney Higgins was granted a withdrawal of his representation of the respondent, or that substitute counsel entered an appearance in his stead. Rather, the record reflects that attorney Higgins appeared at the hearing as scheduled, and that the Immigration Judge found he offered no reasonable cause accounting for the respondent’s absence. See Exh. 6 (March 5, 2007, I.J. dec); see also May 10, 2007, I.J. dec at 5.
 
Under the circumstances presented, the respondent was given proper notice of her March 5, 2007, hearing in accordance with the federal regulatory requirements. See I.J. at 5; 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (2007); see also Men Keng Chang v. Jiugni, 669 F.2d 275, 277(5th Cir. 1982); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985); Exh. 3 (Form EOIR-28, filed November 17, 2006, in Immigration Court by attorney Higgins) and Exh. 5 (hearing notice). In arguing otherwise, the respondent’s reliance on case law handed down by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is misplaced, inasmuch as the instant case arises in the Fifth, not the Ninth, Circuit.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent’s current attorney asserts that the respondent received ineffective assistance by her former attorney. However, none of the requirements for advancing such a claim, as discussed in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), have been satisfied. Citing Ninth Circuit case law, the respondent contends that compliance with the Lozada requirements are not necessary in this case. See Brief, pp. 4-5. However, as has already been noted Ninth Circuit case law is not controlling here. In any event, the Fifth Circuit has specifically held that to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien in removal proceedings must fulfillthe Lozada requirements and must demonstrate that counsel’s actions were prejudicial to his case. See Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006); Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir. 2000). No such showings have been made here.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

In his filings, current counsel inconsistently refers to the respondent in both the male and female gender. Compare Exh. 8 (Motion to Reopen (Motion) filed with the San Antonio Immigration Court April 23, 2007) with Respondent’s Brief on Appeal (Brief). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was female. See May 10, 2007, I.J. dec; see also Record of Deportable Alien (Form I-213). Accordingly, we rely on the Immigration Judge’s finding in this regard.

FILE: AXX XX8 082 - LOS ANGELES, CA
February 11, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven E. Comer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Piepmeier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on November 14, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order entered on January 17, 2006.
 
On December 26, 2007, the respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, filed a motion to reopen and rescind the January 17, 2006, in absentia removal order. The respondent’s motion is based, in part, on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by his two prior attorneys, Mr. David Paz Soldan and Mr. James F. Kajtoch.
 
We will reopen these proceedings on our own motion because we failed to consider the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims against his prior attorneys, Mr. Paz Soldan and Mr. Kajtoch, which he raised on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The respondent’s appeal brief, filed on September 25, 2006, detailed the allegations of his prior attorneys’ wrongdoing. When the respondent presented these claims on appeal, he proffered documentation that established his compliance with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 4-9, Exhibit 4. Yet, we did not consider these claims. See Board’s November 14, 2006, decision at 5.
 
The ineffective assistance of counsel claims raised by the respondent on appeal are the same as those he presents in the instant motion. He claims that on January 17, 2006, he arrived at 8:15 a.m. for his scheduled 8:30 A.M. removal hearing. When he did not find his attorney, Mr. Paz Soldan, he called the law office and was instructed to wait outside the courtroom until his attorney arrived. Mr. Paz Soldan did not arrive until 9:30 A.M. By the time they entered the courtroom together it was empty. When Mr. Paz Soldan failed to file a promised motion to reopen, the respondent retained Mr. Kajtoch.
 
According to the respondent’s August 31, 2006, statement, which was submitted on appeal, when Mr. Kajtoch assisted him in filing a motion to reopen he insisted that the respondent state that he understood that the hearing was scheduled for 9:30 A.M. and that he arrived at the courtroom at 9:15 A.M. The respondent claims that he did not want to tell a lie, but Mr. Kajtoch insisted that it was necessary to obtain reopening. Mr. Kajtoch also advised the respondent not to file a Lozada claim against Mr. Paz Soldan. The respondent also asserted that Mr. Kajtoch erred by failing to support the respondent’s motions to reopen with any applications for relief from removal. See Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 5-9, Attachment 4 at 2-3. Notably, there is no evidence to establish that Mr. Paz Soldan or Mr. Kajtoch ever responded to the respondent’s allegations.
 
*2 Had we adjudicated the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims which he raised on appeal, we would have remanded this case for further proceedings. The respondent followed the directives of both his prior attorneys, Mr. Paz Soldan and Mr. Kajtoch. Had the respondent not relied on his attorneys’ bad advice, he would have appeared for his hearing or obtained reopening. See Monjaraz-Munoz, 327 F.3d 892 (9th Cir. 2003)(if an alien fails to appear because of his actual and reasonable reliance on counsel’s erroneous advice, it can constitute an exceptional circumstance beyond the control of the alien). Based on the foregoing, we find it appropriate to reopen these proceedings on our own motion. Because we find it appropriate to reopen these proceedings, we will not address the remaining issues raised by the respondent in this instant motion.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sigang Li, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Certification
 
*1 On September 19, 2007, the respondent filed this appeal from an Immigration Judge’s July 2, 2007, decision. It is undisputed that the appeal, which was due on or before August 1, 2007, is untimely. With the Notice of Appeal, the respondent has submitted a motion in which he asserts that his former attorney’s mishandling of his case resulted in the untimeliness of the appeal. We will construe the respondent’s motion as a motion for certification to the Board. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (c). The motion will be denied and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
In his motion, the respondent merely asserts that “(h)is counsel reserved the appeal …(h)owever, such appeal was never filed.” He has not, however, provided evidence that he entered into an agreement with his former attorney to filed an appeal. See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (specifying the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the context of motions filed before the Board). Although he has submitted a copy of a complaint against his former attorney to the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the respondent has not submitted proof that the complaint has been properly filed, and he has not submitted a statement of the alleged misrepresentations. The evidence submitted with the motion simply fails to show that ineffective assistance of counsel caused the untimeliness of the appeal. Accordingly, the motion for certification will be denied, and the untimely appeal will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, and 1240.15. The Immigration Judge’s decision is now final, and the record will be returned to the Immigration Court.¿FN1º See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.39 and 1240.14.
 
The following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion for certification to the Board is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The untimely appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

The respondent’s appeal has been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely must be filed with the Board. However, a motion challenging any other finding or seeking reopening of the proceedings must be filed with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). Strict time and number limits apply to motions to reconsider and motions to reopen before the Immigration Judge and this Board. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2) and 1003.23(b)(1).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ronald G. Finch, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John R. Holya
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º -In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s March 22, 2007, decision denying her “Motion to Reconsider.” The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The procedural history of this case is as follows. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on June 29, 2004, because she failed to appear for a hearing. On March 31, 2006, she filed a motion to reopen alleging that she did not receive notice of the hearing, which was granted by the Immigration Judge on April 17, 2006. The respondent was given until January 24, 2007, to file an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). When the respondent failed to timely file her application for cancellation of removal, the Immigration Judge found that her application had been abandoned and granted her voluntary departure in a decision dated February 7, 2007. On February 26, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, which the Immigration Judge denied on March 6, 2007. The respondent then filed a “Motion to Reconsider,” which the Immigration Judge denied on March 22, 2007. The respondent now appeals from the Immigration Judge’s denial of her “Motion to Reconsider.” On appeal, the respondent seeks reopening of proceedings because she was the victim of ineffective assistance. Specifically, the respondent contends that she failed to timely file her application for cancellation of removal because her current counsel failed to inform her in writing of her filing deadline.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s “Motion to Reconsider.” To the extent that the respondent’s “Motion to Reconsider”challenged the merits of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen, we find that she failed to establish any material error of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Specifically, we find that the Immigration Judge properly determined that the respondent failed to file a copy of her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act with her motion to reopen, as required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Because we find that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen for the above mentioned reason, we need not address the Immigration Judge’s additional finding that the respondent’s motion to reopen was number-barred. To the extent that the respondent sought to submit a copy of her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act with her “Motion to Reconsider,” we construe her motion as a motion to reopen rather than as a motion to reconsider. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (providing that a motion to reopen is granted upon a proffer of new, material evidence); cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1) (providing that a motion to reconsider challenges determinations of law and fact). Since this was the respondent’s second motion to reopen filed after her in absentia removal order had been reopened, we find that it was number-barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
*2 Moreover, to the extent that the respondent seeks to submit new evidence on appeal in the form of a self-reporting letter to the Arizona State Bar from her current counsel alleging that he engaged in ineffective assistance, we are precluded from engaging in fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(iv) (providing that, subject to certain exceptions not applicable to the present case, the Board will not engage in fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals and that a party asserting that the Board cannot properly resolve an appeal without further fact-finding must file a motion to remand). Furthermore, we find that remand of proceedings based on this new evidence is not warranted. The letter does not concede that he and his assistants failed orally to provide the respondent with notice of the application deadline but merely contends that he should have done so in writing. Moreover, the respondent has not met the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered:
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $ 1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

January 31, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lidia Sanchez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Rescission
 
*1 ORDER: PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia in a December 4, 2006, Immigration Judge’s decision. She filed a motion to reopen proceedings on January 3, 2007, alleging that former counsel provided her with ineffective assistance as he misrepresented his handling of the case, and failed to inform her of her hearing date and time. In a February 14, 2007, decision an Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding the respondent had not complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent’s appeal of this decision is dismissed.
 
The Board has held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). Matter of Lozada requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639; see also Betouche v. Ashcroft, 357F.3d 147, 149 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing the above-noted requirements).
 
The Immigration Judge correctly found the respondent failed to comply with the requirements enumerated in Matter of Lozada, supra, as she did not show that she had notified former counsel of her claim, and filed a complaint against him with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. We find no merit to the respondent’s vague and generalized allegations that the Immigration Judge’s decision was “arbitrary and capricious,” an “abuse of discretion,” and “against the law” (Notice of Appeal).
 
*2 The respondent has not expounded on these ambiguous and unsupported assertions, and we find no support for the same.
 
On appeal the respondent submitted a letter which she reportedly filed with the bar authorities complaining about former counsel’s actions. However, we normally do not consider new evidence submitted on appeal as the record we review on appeal is the record before the Immigration Judge. Matter of H-A-, 20 I&N Dec. 529 (BIA 1992); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988); Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984) (the Board is an appellate body whose function is to review, not to create, a record.). Moreover, we do not find that a remand in this regard is warranted. There is no evidence that this letter was, in fact, filed with the authorities as alleged. Further, there is no evidence that the respondent’s former counsel has been informed of the allegations against him and afforded an opportunity to respond.¿FN1º See Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 9, 10-12 (1st Cir. 2004) (finding that counsel targeted by an ineffective assistance claim must “be provided an opportunity to respond before filing the motion to reopen”(emphasis added)). Therefore, as the respondent to date has yet to comply with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a remand in this regard is not appropriate. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2; see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992).
 
In sum, as the respondent has not established that she failed to appear at her hearing due to her former representative’s ineffective assistance, the Immigration Judge did not err in denying her motion to reopen. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

The circuit where this case arises has declined to find that the mere lodging of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with the bar authorities functionally satisfies the notice requirement. Betouche v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d at 151 (holding that the filing “simply established that ¿ the petitionerº had notified the Board of Bar Overseers of his complaint, not that either he or the Board had notified ¿prior counselº.”). Moreover, as noted, there is no objective evidence that such a claim has, in fact, been filed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James C. Ten Broeck, Jr., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ellen J. Krupp
Assistant Chief Counsel, ICE
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)º - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
  
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s July 17, 2006, decision dismissing the respondent’s motion to terminate proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native of Lithuania who asserts that she is a citizen of the Ukraine, entered the United States as a visitor in April 2000 as a visitor, and adjusted her status to that of immigrant in November 2003, based upon the approval of a Petition for Alien Relative, filed by the respondent’s husband. After interviewing the respondent’s husband about the bona fides of the relationship, the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) initiated removal proceedings against the respondent, charging her with having engaged in marriage fraud.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), because she procured her adjustment of status by marriage fraud under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act. (I.J. at 3-4, 16-17). Section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act states: “Any alien who, by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact, seeks to procure (or has sought to procure or has procured) a visa, other documentation, or entry into the United States or other benefit provided under this Act is excludable.”
 
The central question in determining the good faith of a marriage is whether the bride and groom intended to establish a life together at the time they were married. See, e.g., Matter of Soriano, 19 I&N Dec. 764, 765 (BIA 1988); Matter of Laureano, 19 I&N Dec. 1, 2-3 (BIA 1983). Evidence of such intent may include, but is not limited to, proof that the spouse has been listed on insurance policies, proof of joint property leases, income tax forms, bank accounts, a period of courtship, testimony of mutual experiences and a shared life, and the like. It also may include documentation relating to the degree to which the financial assets and liabilities of the parties were combined; documentation concerning the length of time during which the parties cohabited after the marriage and after the alien obtained permanent residence; and any other evidence supporting the bona fides of the marriage. See Matter of Laureano, supra; Matter of Phillis, 15 I&N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1216.4(a)(5) and 1216.5 (e)(2).
 
*2 In the present case, the respondent’s husband (a United States citizen petitioner) signed a statement in August 2004 in which he indicated that his marriage with the respondent was not consummated, and that he just wanted to help her become an American citizen (Exh. 2). He also described how the respondent’s daughter and son-in-law paid him, and helped arrange the marriage (Exh. 2). The petitioner now testifies that he signed under duress, and that his statement should not be considered (Tr. at 53, 73-74). We agree with the Immigration Judge that more weight should be given to the testimony of the special agents who interviewed the petitioner than to the testimony of the petitioner (I.J. at 10, 15), and that the petitioner’s statement should be considered.
 
The respondent has argued that in a number of instances, the testimony of the special agents was irrelevant, speculative, lacked foundation, and called for conclusions of law and/or opinions, and that because it was admitted into evidence, it rendered the proceedings unfair and was in violation of the due process clause of the Constitution (R brief at 6-9). We point out that in administrative removal proceedings, the Federal Rules of Evidence are not controlling. See Matter of Grijalva, 19 I&N Dec. 713 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). Rather, under the applicable federal regulations, the Immigration Judge may receive into evidence any oral or written statement which is material and relevant to any issue in the case previously made by the alien or any other person during any investigation or examination. See 8 C.F.R. § 1236.1 (2005); see generally 8 C.F.R. § 1242.14. The testimony of the special agents was certainly probative as to the circumstances surrounding the petitioner’s signing his statement. Likewise, the witness testimony permitted by the Immigration Judge was subject to cross examination by the respondent pursuant to section 240(b)(4)(B), and we thus find the reliance on such testimony by the Immigration Judge to be fundamentally fair. Furthermore, the Immigration Judge did not state that he was assigning more weight to the testimony of the special agents because of the disputed testimony that the respondent referred to.
 
Regarding the disputed testimony, the respondent argues that her first counsel of record should have cross-examined the special agents, and that her failure to do so constituted ineffective assistance of counsel (R brief at 8-9). The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge unreasonably held that the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) could not be deviated from (Tr. at 231-34). We note that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be supported by: 1) an affidavit by the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; 2) a showing that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and 3) a showing that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, or if not, why not. See id. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not complied with the first requirement of Lozada, i.e., submitting an affidavit detailing the agreement that she had with her first attorney (Tr. at 231-34). Although several circuits have held that aliens only need to show substantial compliance with Lozada, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (the “Seventh Circuit”), under whose jurisdiction the current case arises, is not one of those circuits. See Patel v. Gonzales, 496 F. 3d 829, 831 (7th Cir. 2007) (Court notes that while several Circuits have held that aliens only need to show substantial compliance with the requirements of Lozada, the Seventh Circuit has not expressly decided whether the Board abuses its discretion by requiring strict compliance with Lozada).
 
*3 Furthermore, even if is conceded that the requirements of Lozada were substantially complied with, the actions of counsel that are in question, i.e., allowing the aforementioned testimony of special agents to be admitted into evidence, allowing said agents to testify from memory without reference to their I-213 report, and not using said report as a cross-examination device, do not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel. Even if it is assumed that counsel should have performed all or some of the aforementioned actions, these actions (or inactions) strike us as tactical decisions, and it is not considered ineffective assistance for counsel to make tactical decisions that are not successful and operate to the client’s detriment. See Away v. Ashcroft, 328 F.3d 336, 343 (7th Cir. 2003) (hindsight applied to unwise tactical decision, to withdrawal of application for asylum, does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge violated her due process rights by denying her “Motion for Issuance of Subpoenas for Officers’ Materials & to Recall Officers as Witnesses” and a renewed “Motion for Issuance of Subpoenas for Officers’ Materials & to Recall Officers as Witnesses” (R brief at 9-10). In particular, she argues that the Immigration Judge should not have denied these motions summarily, and that the Immigration Judge should have reviewed the officer’s materials “in camera.” We point out that the Immigration Judge did not deny the aforementioned motions summarily (Tr. at 234-39). Rather, he denied them because the respondent did not contact the special agents to see if they would attend the hearing pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1287.4(a)(2)(ii)(B) (Tr. at 235). Furthermore, the respondent’s first attorney testified that after filing a FOIA request, she had been given a compact disc from the Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement which contained a reprint of the respondent’s file, albeit with much redaction and no notes from investigators (Tr. at 237-38). If the respondent wished to see if there was more information than was presented to her first attorney, she had a duty to try to obtain that information pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1287.4(a)(2)(ii)(B) before asking the Immigration Judge to issue a subpoena.
 
The respondent next argues that the Government did not meet its burden by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent committed marriage fraud under § 212(a)(6)(C)(I) (R at 10-13). However, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the Government did meet said burden (I.J. at 4). The Immigration Judge specifically found that the testimony of the special agents who interviewed the petitioner should be fully credited over the equivocal testimony of the petitioner and his roommate (I.J. at 10). The Immigration Judge gave reasons for his conclusion, and found that contrary to the testimony of the petitioner and his roommate, the special agents testified clearly and convincingly (I.J. at 15). These factual determinations are not “clearly erroneous.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(i)(2005) (requiring this Board to review factual determinations of an Immigration Judge for clear error); Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, North Carolina, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985) (emphasizing the great deference accorded to findings regarding the credibility of witnesses under the “clearly erroneous” standard of review).
 
*4 The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should not have given more weight to the agents than to the petitioner regarding whether the petitioner signed his statement on August 6, 2004, under duress by the special agents (R brief at 10-11). We find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to accord greater weight to the special agent’s testimony than to the petitioner and his roommate (I.J. at 10, 15). There was no indication that the special agents’ testimony was in any way unreliable regarding whether the petitioner signed his statement under duress. Although the petitioner testified that the special agents told him that they would take him to jail if he didn’t talk and that he felt forced to give testimony (Tr. at 53, 73-74), one of the special agents testified that the interview was not uncomfortable, and that he wanted to impress upon the petitioner that he wasn’t being hostile (Tr. at 114-15). Furthermore, both special agents did not testify that they told the petitioner he would go to jail if he did not talk, but testified that they informed him of the consequences of marriage fraud and perjury(Tr. at 134, 164). We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the petitioner has not shown that he did not understand what he was signing in August 2004 (I.J. at 14-15). Although a physician expresses concern about the petitioner’s ability to internalize stress in a letter dated April 2006, (Exh. 3-2), the letter does not call into question the petitioner’s ability to understand what he was signing in August 2004 (I.J. at 14). The petitioner submitted an affidavit dated April 2006 (Exh. 3-1), in which he did not deny that his signature and initials appeared on the August 2004 statement, but that he was under great emotional and physical stress, and did not know what he was signing. However, we point out that one of the questions asked on the respondent’s statement (Exh. 2) was whether he understood he was giving a sworn statement and whether he swore that his statements were the truth.
 
The respondent also argues that the special agents testified strictly from memory without referring to their I-213, and that they did not enter the I-213 into evidence (R brief at 12-13). While this is true, it does not strike us as meaningful. Although the respondent argues that the government usually enters the I-213s into evidence (R brief at 12), the respondent has not provided any proof that this is true. The respondent has attempted to describe the agents’ testimony as riddled with so many inconsistencies (R brief at 11-13) that it cannot be believed regarding the crucial question as to whether her husband signed his statement under duress. However, the inconsistencies that the respondent points to (the time that the agents arrived at the apartment, the school that the petitioner’s roommate attended, and whether or not the petitioner and his roommate jointly bought the apartment that they shared together), even if true, are not material. They certainly do not render the agents’ testimony less credible regarding the petitioner’s statement (Exh. 2), and in particular, whether or not there was any duress in his signing it.
 
*5 As to the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge ignored as a matter of law that parties need not necessarily live together to be considered legitimately married (R brief at 13), this is not true. While the Immigration Judge pointed out that the petitioner and the respondent did not live together (I.J. at 19), this was not the main reason for the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent had engaged in marriage fraud. Furthermore, 8 C.F.R. § 1216.5(e)(2) specifically lists “documentation concerning the length of time during which the parties cohabited after the marriage and after the alien obtained permanent residence” as an element to consider when considering whether an alien entered into a qualifying marriage in good faith.
 
In conclusion, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision dismissing the respondent’s motion to terminate proceedings, and finding the respondent removable for procuring her admission to the United States through adjustment of status by marriage fraud under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice; Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Asylum, withholding of removal, Convention Against Torture; reopening
 
This case is presently before us on the respondent’s timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s November 2, 2006, order denying his motion to reopen an in absentia order of removal that was entered on August 2, 2006. Along with his appeal brief, the respondent moved to reopen this matter based upon changed country conditions and also based on a then-pending visa petition, filed by his United States citizen wife after their July 2003 marriage. The visa petition has since been approved, and a visa is immediately available to the respondent. See August 13, 2007, Supplement to Motion to Reopen.¿FN1º However, because the motion to reopen to pursue adjustment of status was not filed within 90 days of the entry of the original in absentia order of removal, it is untimely and will be denied.
 
In his brief in support of his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen the in absentia order of removal, the respondent argues that reopening is appropriate because ineffective assistance of prior counsel caused him to miss his scheduled hearing on August 2, 2006. Although, as the Immigration Judge indicated, the respondent was present when a hearing notice was provided to his prior counsel, he does not speak English and attests that he was never given a copy of the notice. See Immigration Judge’s November 2, 2006, Order; Respondent’s January 11, 2007, Brief at Exh. 3. Indeed, there appears to be some question about how (or if) the respondent was notified of the August 2, 2006, hearing, in that the Department of Homeland Security (“the DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) indicated below that an evidentiary hearing should be held to determine if the former attorney had, as he claimed, “called the respondent” to notify him of the August 2, 2006, hearing. See DHS’s September 18, 2006, Answer to Motion to Reopen. The respondent’s wife provided an affidavit in support of the motion to reopen below that states that the couple was unaware of the date of the August 2, 2006, hearing and that she repeatedly called the attorney’s office to find out the hearing date but was never told about it. See Respondent’s September 14, 2006, Motion to Reopen. She supports this affidavit with telephone records that purportedly indicate telephone calls to former counsel. Id. Additionally, the respondent’s wife indicated in the same affidavit that the couple did not receive notice of a prior rescheduled hearing from former counsel, and instead only learned of the new hearing date by calling the Immigration Court. Id.
 
*2 Because the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for setting forth ineffective assistance of counsel claims, has set forth facts that, if found by the Immigration Judge, would tend to indicate ineffective assistance of counsel, and has shown prejudice from that ineffective assistance in the form of his apparent eligibility for adjustment of status, we will sustain the respondent’s appeal. Further fact- finding is necessary to determine if the respondent has set forth an actionable claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. Because we will sustain the appeal and remand this record, we need not address the respondent’s arguments regarding changed country conditions in Lebanon.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen to pursue adjustment of status is denied.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained and the Immigration Judge’s November 2, 2006, order denying the respondent’s motion to reopen is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order.
 
Board Member Patricia A. Cole concurs with the majority’s decision to deny respondent’s motion to reopen to pursue adjustment of status. However, the evidence of record does not support a conclusion that the respondent did not receive proper notice to appear at his removal hearing. I would not grant the respondent’s motion to reopen the in absentia order of removal and dissent from this portion of the majority’s decision.

The motion to reopen, which has since been supplemented and updated, is supported by evidence of the bona fides of the marriage, including the fact that as of the last filing in this matter, the couple was expecting the birth of their first child.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Saher Joseph Macarius, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s November 8, 2006, decision denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings. The motion was denied as untimely. On appeal, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance from his former counsel, and that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Lebanon who entered the United States on April 17, 2002, as a nonimmigrant visitor for business with authorization to remain in this country for a temporary period not to exceed June 16, 2002. He remained in the United States beyond this date without authorization, and was served with a Notice to Appear on January 9, 2003. The respondent appeared pro se at a hearing before an Immigration Judge on November 12, 2003, and explained that he married a United States citizen on June 2, 2003, and that a Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) was filed on his behalf. The Immigration Judge advised the respondent to submit evidence in support of his claim. The respondent subsequently retained counsel, who appeared on his behalf at a March 24, 2004, hearing. At that time, the respondent requested a continuance to await the approval of the Form I-130, and, in the alternative, sought voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge denied the request for a continuance because the respondent had failed to present evidence that a Form I-130 had been filed on his behalf, and denied voluntary departure in the exercise of discretion. The respondent filed a motion to reconsider on May 6, 2004, which was denied as untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
In an August 22, 2006, motion to reopen, the respondent argued that his removal proceedings should be reopened because his former attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. In particular, he alleged that his prior counsel failed to file documents requested by the Immigration Judge, discouraged him from appealing the Immigration Judge’s decision, failed to timely file his motion to reconsider, and did not advise him of his right to file a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely. A motion to reopen before an Immigration Judge must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order of removal. See 8 C.F.R, § 1003.23(b). See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). In the instant case, the respondent’s motion would have been due on or before June 24, 2004. As noted above, the respondent did not file his motion to reopen until August 22, 2006.
 
*2 For an alien raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the untimeliness of the motion may possibly be excused under the doctrine of equitable tolling if the alien establishes that he exercised due diligence. See Cai Xing Chen v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 151, 154 n. 3 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting the issue remains unresolved). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not exercised due diligence in this case. The respondent was aware of the evidence the Immigration Judge requested from him in November 2003, and that his former attorney failed to submit this evidence in support of his claim. He knew that the Immigration Judge denied his request for a continuance on March 24, 2004, and that his prior counsel did not appeal this decision. In addition, the respondent knew that the Immigration Judge denied his untimely motion to reconsider on May 6, 2004. Consequently, the conduct of his prior attorney has been known by him since mid-2004. Yet the respondent did not file the motion until nearly 2 1/2 years after the Immigration Judge’s decision. We find that these facts do not support a finding that the respondent has acted with due diligence.
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that he did not know that his former counsel was ineffective until he obtained the services of his present attorney. This argument fails. While the respondent may not have characterized his former counsel’s actions as “ineffective” as that term is used by legal practitioners in immigration proceedings, he was well aware of his counsel’s failure to submit evidence to the Immigration Court, appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 24, 2004, decision, or file a timely motion to reconsider. Thus, he was aware of the deficiencies in his former attorney’s conduct but did not timely pursue any action regarding his conduct. Moreover, the impetus for the filing of the motion to reopen appears to be less related to any actions or conduct by the respondent’s former counsel and more related to the fact that the Form I-130 filed on his behalf was approved in September 2005. Because we find that the respondent did not act with due diligence, we agree with the Immigration Judge that his motion is not subject to equitable tolling and was properly denied as untimely. Thus, we need not address the issues of whether the respondent complied with the 1requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), or whether his counsel was ineffective and he was prejudiced thereby.
 
During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand the record for consideration of his application for adjustment of status. A motion to remand filed with the Board must, among other things, state the new facts to be considered at the reopened hearing and must be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary materials demonstrating prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). In support of his motion, the respondent submitted a duplicate copy of a Notice of Approval of Relative Immigrant Visa Petition from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services indicating that the Form I-130 filed on his behalf by his wife was approved on September 23, 2005. While the respondent also provided a copy of his application for adjustment of status (Form I-485), his marriage certificate, and evidence of the bona fides of his marriage, he has failed to explain why this evidence was “not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Thus, we cannot conclude that these proceedings should be remanded on the basis of “circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the bearing.” Id. Further, we note that granting the respondent’s motion would undermine the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his request for a continuance pending the adjudication of the Form I-130 filed on his behalf, and would reward him for his delay in filing evidence previously requested by the Immigration Judge. In order to avoid this unjust result, we deny the respondent’s motion in the exercise of discretion. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed and his motion is denied.

IN RE: JOSE SERGIO PEDRAZA-GONZALEZ
FILE: AXX XX8 139 - PHOENIX, AZ
January 25, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John M. Pope, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Linda I. Spencer-Walters
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 In a decision dated December 13, 2006, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal to Mexico, should he fail to avail himself of voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge noted that any claims for relief were deemed abandoned, since no applications had been filed by the due date of August 8, 2005. The respondent has, through counsel, filed an appeal and a motion to remand. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal but has not addressed the motion. Since the appeal will be sustained, the motion to remand is moot.
 
The basis for the appeal and motion, in its essence, is that the respondent was prejudiced by ineffective assistance, not of counsel, but of a paralegal employed by counsel. It is maintained that the paralegal, having been assigned to do so, failed to file the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal in a timely manner.
 
A review of the record reveals that current counsel has represented the respondent as least since May 2004. Counsel, or his partner, was present at every hearing held in the respondent’s case. At the hearing held on April 6, 2005, counsel’s partner, Mr. Stender, appeared with the respondent and was informed by the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 25) that the respondent’s application for cancellation was due no later than August 8, 2005. The respondent indicated his understanding of his duty to cooperate with counsel in the preparation of his application. The application was not timely filed.
 
In an affidavit, counsel has stated that the paralegal who was responsible for filing the application was subsequently terminated after making “many mistakes,” including failing to meet deadlines.
 
The counsel of record, not an employee with no direct representational relationship with the respondent, was ultimately responsible for the submission of any and all applications in a timely manner. Under the circumstances, the Immigration Judge’s action in this matter was not unreasonable. Rules of procedure for Immigration Courts exist, in part, to ensure the timely submission of evidence and applications in proceedings. Neither the alien nor the administrative process is well-served by the piecemeal or untimely submission of pertinent documents in a particular case, especially applications for relief.
 
Ineffective assistance cases are generally governed by the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Azanor v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2004); Lata v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 204 F.3d 1241 (9th Cir. 2000). Insufficient compliance with those guidelines has been demonstrated in this case. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this case arises, has stated that the Lozada requirements “are not sacrosanct,” and that a case for ineffective assistance of counsel can be made, even without strict Lozada compliance, where the record shows a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” See, e.g., Granados-Oseguera v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 993 (9th Cir. 2006); Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582 (9th Cir. 2006); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 In our view, this case presents such a situation. The respondent was prevented a reasonable opportunity to present his case, since he was not even able to have his application for cancellation of removal considered, due to counsel’s failure to ensure that it was timely filed. Accordingly, we deem it appropriate to sustain the appeal and remand the case for the Immigration Judge to adjudicate the respondent’s cancellation application and render a decision, either granting or denying that relief.
 
In remanding this case, we intimate no opinion as to the respondent’s eligibility or worthiness for the discretionary relief he seeks.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and the Immigration Judge’s decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and for the entry of a new decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lauren H. Mason, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mike Ochoa
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the February 16, 2007, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s request for reopening of the August 30, 2006, in absentia order. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).¿FN1º
 
The respondent, a citizen and native of China, was arrested near McAllen, Texas, on June 11, 2006. Exh. 1 at 3. She admitted to being present in the United States without having been admitted or paroled after inspection. Exh. 2 at 2. The next day, she was given several documents, including a Notice to Appear at a hearing before an Immigration Judge in Harlingen, Texas, on August 30, 2006. Id.; Exh. 1 at 1. Through a Mandarin interpreter, an immigration officer also advised the respondent that she should find a good lawyer to handle her case. Exh. B at 2. The immigration officer also gave the respondent a list of free or low-cost legal service providers in the area of Harlingen-Brownsville, Texas. Id. Instead of contacting these providers, the respondent traveled to Los Angeles (where she apparently had a few friends and acquaintances). Id On or about June 23, 2006, she went to the offices of a two-attorney law firm in Los Angeles. Exh. E. While there, she spoke to an “American looking man” through a “Korean speaking lady” who served as an interpreter (the respondent’s best language is Korean). Id. The interpreter apparently first told the respondent that the documents she had indicated that she should go to court in Texas. Id. The respondent apparently asked if someone from the firm could go with her to court (although she has never indicated what the reply to this question was). Id.; Exh. B at 2. The respondent was then apparently told that she should not go to the Texas immigration court and that if she did, she would be arrested and sent back to China. Id. On appeal, the respondent contends that “¿aºlthough it is not clear that either attorney actually gave ¿meº the wrong advice, their employee did and they should be held responsible.” Respondent’s Brief at 7.
 
Where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is made, certain criteria must be met. Specifically, the claim must be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make, counsel must be informed of the allegations against him or her and provided an opportunity to respond, and the respondent must indicate whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2006) (citing Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-498 (5th Cir. 2000) (upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada)). It is questionable as to whether an ineffective assistance of counsel claim can be made based on representations made by nonattorney interpreters of a law firm. Regardless, the Lozada requirements have not been met in this case: the respondent has failed to identify the nonattorney employee in question, she has not shown that the “American looking man” (or any attorney affiliated with this law firm) actually agreed to represent her, and she has failed to establish that an agreement was entered into with respect to actions to be taken on her behalf.
 
*2 In short, the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent’s decision to rely upon the alleged instructions to not attend the immigration hearing in Texas on August 30, 2006, is not an “exceptional circumstance” within the meaning of section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. I.J. at 2. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on August 27, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision that, among other things, denied his motion to terminate the removal proceedings based on his claim of derivative citizenship and ordered him removed to his native Colombia. In that decision, we concluded that the respondent failed to derive United States citizenship from his mother under former section 321(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1432, upon her naturalization on May 16, 1996, because the respondent had failed to demonstrate that his mother had actual uncontested custody of him at the time of her naturalization. On November 26, 2007, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen his removal proceedings. The motion will be denied.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent initially argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his claim of derivative citizenship and deprived him of due process during his removal proceedings by hampering his ability to present his claim of derivative citizenship. However, in that regard, his motion is more in the nature of a motion to reconsider than a motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1) (providing that a motion to reconsider is a challenge to errors of fact or law in the Board’s decision); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 2001) (stating that motions to reopen and motions to reconsider are separate and distinct motions with different requirements). The motion is untimely because it was not filed within 30 days of our August 27, 2007, order, and the respondent has offered no explanation for his untimely filing to justify the equitable tolling of that deadline. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); cf. Ghahremani v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 993, 999-1000 (9th Cir. 2007) (noting that an alien seeking equitable tolling of the period for filing a motion to reopen must show that he exercised due diligence in vindicating his rights). Moreover, upon review of the respondent’s arguments and all relevant portions of the record, we conclude that the respondent has failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances that would warrant sua sponte reconsideration of our August 27, 2007, order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
The respondent also argues that reopening of his proceedings is warranted based on new evidence that was previously unavailable to him that demonstrates his eligibility for derivative citizenship. While such evidence, if present, would warrant reopening, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (c)(2), the respondent has presented no such evidence here. In that regard, most of the evidence accompanying the respondent’s motion to reopen was either already presented to the Immigration Court (Motion to Reopen, Exhs. G-K, M; see also Record of Proceedings Exh. 3, Tab D; Exh. 5, Tabs 1-7, Exh. 11, Tabs 1-7) or substantially identical in form and substance to evidence that was submitted before the Immigration Court (Motion to Reopen, Exhs. B, D; Record of Proceedings, Exh. 9). Moreover, the respondent has not shown that the “new” affidavits prepared by himself, his mother, and his godfather after our August 27, 2007, decision could not have been discovered or presented at his May 17, 2007, hearing before the Immigration Judge (Motion to Reopen, Exhs. A, C, F). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent also has not shown that the evidence regarding his arrival and departure dates from Colombia between 1993 and 2000 could not have been discovered or presented at his May 17, 2007, removal proceedings (Motion to Reopen, Exh. E). See id.
 
*2 Finally, we reject the respondent’s contention that reopening is warranted based on ineffective assistance of counsel. As the respondent himself acknowledges, he has failed to comply with any of the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (1988), for claims alleging ineffective assistance of counsel (Motion to Reopen, Affidavit of the Respondent). See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (BIA 2000) (recognizing that the Lozada requirements are generally reasonable, and that under ordinary circumstances the Board does not abuse its discretion when it denies a motion to remand or reopen based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel where the petitioner fails to meet the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra). Moreover, we do not find plain evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel in the record that would excuse the respondent’s noncompliance with Matter of Lozada, supra. Cf. id. at 526 (compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, not required where the record was undisputed that the alien’s lawyer failed, without any reason, to file an application for suspension of deportation in spite of having told the alien that he did file it); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir.) (compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, not required where it was plain from the administrative record that counsel was being represented by an attorney whom she had never met and who had no understanding of her case), amended by 213 F.3d 1221 (9th Cir. 2000). An alien who raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must demonstrate that counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence, and must establish that he was prejudiced by counsel’s performance. See Grigoryan v. Keisler, 507 F.3d 1206, 1210 (9th Cir. 2007). The respondent has failed to make that showing. Specifically, given the lack of any evidence that the respondent’s mother was awarded legal custody of him from the Colombian government following her divorce from the respondent’s father, the respondent cannot show that he sustained prejudice from his former counsel’s alleged failure to inquire whether his mother was awarded foreign legal custody of him and to advise him that a foreign court’s grant of legal custody may have changed the outcome of these proceedings. We also find no support in the record for the respondent’s general allegations that counsel failed to “keep herself abreast of relevant and significant applications and proper understanding of ¿iºmmigration ¿s ºtatutes, (Motion to Reopen at 22), that counsel “was very untruthful, unprofessional and had a serious problem with procrastinating (Motion at 23),” or that counsel hid her record of prior Florida Bar suspensions from the respondent and the Immigration Court (Motion to 23).¿FN1º
 
*3 For the foregoing reasons, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that reopening of these proceedings is warranted. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

We note that the record shows that the respondent’s counsel did, in fact, admit to her prior suspensions at the respondent’s immigration proceedings and that the Immigration Judge rejected the Department of Homeland Security’s assertion that she had improperly failed to indicate that she was “subject” to an order of suspension by an administrative agency in her Form EOIR-28 (Notice of Entry of Appearance or Representative Before the Immigration Court) in light of those previous suspensions (Tr. at 32-34).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William H. Oltarsh, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decisions dated January 3, 2007, and January 9, 2007, denying the respondent’s motions to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States, following the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing on December 6, 2006. The appeals will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the respondent was scheduled to appear for a hearing on December 6, 2006, in Atlanta, Georgia. On December 4, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to change venue. The respondent failed to appear for the hearing on December 6, 2006, and was ordered removed in absentia, The respondent subsequently filed a motion to reopen, in which his attorney of record, William H. Oltarsh, Esquire, stated that his own spouse was suffering from terminal cancer, and that he failed to advise the respondent that he had to appear for his hearing on December 6, 2006. With the motion to reopen, the respondent submitted a sworn statement requesting that venue be changed to New York, New York. However, the respondent failed to provide any explanation for his failure to appear at the hearing on December 6, 2006. The Immigration Judge found that the attorney’s filings admit actual notice of the hearing, and failure to notify the respondent is not a basis for reopening absent a Lozada affidavit. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). On appeal, Mr. Oltarsh has submitted a sworn statement in which he indicates that he believes he informed the respondent that he was required to appear for a master calendar hearing in Atlanta, Georgia, but Mr. Oltarsh cannot remember the exact details due to his wife’s terminal illness.
 
The Board has held that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the respondent of his responsibility to appear, and unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988); Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 1985), aff’d, Patel v. INS, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986). Furthermore, we have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). The respondent has not asserted that he failed to appear due to ineffective assistance of counsel, nor has he submitted an affidavit in support of such a claim. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent had proper notice of his hearing, and an attorney’s failure to notify a client is not a basis for reopening absent compliance with Lozada. As the respondent failed to submit an affidavit in support of his motion to reopen pursuant to Lozada, the Immigration Judge correctly determined that reopening is not warranted in this matter.
 
*2 The respondent also appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 9, 2007, denying the respondent’s second motion to reopen filed on January 4, 2007. The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the exceptional circumstances must relate to the respondent, such that the illness of counsel’s spouse does not constitute an exceptional circumstance. Furthermore, the respondent’s second motion to reopen is number-barred pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Accordingly, the respondent’s appeals are dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Isuf Kola, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brendan Curran
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 10, 2007. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2007). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2007).
 
The respondent was convicted of Retail Theft on July 24, 2006. He was sentenced to probation. Because he violated probation, he was resentenced to two years in jail. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable for having an aggravated felony relating to theft.
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that removability was not proved. The Immigration and Nationality Act provides that “Any alien … in and admitted to the United States shall, upon the order of the Attorney General, be removed if the alien is within one or more of the following classes of deportable aliens …. (iii) Aggravated Felony.--Any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.” See 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (1996). The term “aggravated felony” includes a theft offense (including receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment ¿isº at least one year.” See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G) (1997).
 
Within the record is an information charging the respondent with Retail Theft and a certified statement of conviction and disposition. That document indicates that the respondent pled guilty to the charge and was sentenced to probation on July 24, 2006. It also indicates that the respondent was found guilty of violating probation and sentenced to two years on April 24, 2007. We find clear and convincing evidence of removability. See Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276, 286 (1966); 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3) (1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(a) (2007). Cf. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.15, 1240.10 (2007).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent also disputes that he received a two-year jail sentence for the theft offense. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment following revocation of probation is a modification of the original sentence. See U.S. v. Hidalgo-Marcias, 300 F.3d 281, 284-85 (2nd Cir. 2002) (conviction for attempted burglary became an aggravated felony after probation was revoked and sentenced to an additional one-year sentence); U.S. v. Jimenez, 258 F.3d 1120, 1125-26 (9th Cir. 2001) (conviction for infliction of corporal injury on a spouse became an aggravated felony after probation was revoked and sentenced to two years).
 
Also on appeal, the respondent claims he has received ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the respondent has failed to fulfil the prerequisites for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498, 501 (7th Cir. 2001).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mario DeMarco, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Craig A. Harlow
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s July 26, 2007, decision concluding that the respondent, a native and citizen of Italy, is removable and ineligible for cancellation of removal as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. Sections 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 240A(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1229b(a)(3)(2000).
 
During his removal hearing, the respondent admitted through counsel that he was removable as charged. (Tr. 2). Having conceded that he is removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, it necessarily follows that he cannot demonstrate the absence of an aggravated felony conviction in connection with his cancellation of removal application. Applicable regulations, which have the force and effect of law as to the Immigration Judges and this Board, provide in pertinent part that “the immigration judge may determine that removability as charged has been established by the admissions of the respondent.” 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c) (2007). Accordingly, the distinct and formal concession of removability, made by the respondent’s attorney acting in his professional capacity and in the respondent’s presence during the removal hearing, is binding on the respondent as a judicial admission, and he will not now be heard to challenge the factual findings or legal conclusions of the Immigration Judge that arose from that concession. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986); cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(B) (authorizing summary dismissal of appeals when “¿tºhe only reason for the appeal specified by the party concerned involves a finding of fact or a conclusion of law that was conceded by that party at a prior proceeding”). Furthermore, the binding effect of an attorney’s concession of removability applies with equal force in a proceeding predicated on criminal convictions. Matter of Pichardo, 21 I&N Dec. 330, 333 n.2 (BIA 1996). Finally, the respondent has not argued or proven that his prior attorney’s concession of removability constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N.Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 In conclusion, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision ordering the respondent removed from the United States on the basis of his attorney’s concession of removability. Because the respondent is removable and ineligible for cancellation of removal on the basis of his concession, we do not address his appellate arguments regarding the validity of the aggravated felony charge or the Immigration Judge decision pretermitting his cancellation of removal application.
 
The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rachel S. Ullman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dimple R. Shah
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On May 21, 2004, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under sections 240A(b)(l)(B) and (2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.§§ 1229b(b)(l)(B) and (2)(A)(iii), based on a determination that the respondent was not a person of good moral character during the requisite periods. On July 20, 2005, the Board summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal for failure to file a brief.¿FN1º
 
The respondent did not comply with the final order of removal. Rather, she continued to work without authorization as a nanny. The respondent filed the instant motion to reopen on July 5, 2007, after the Department of Homeland Security sought to enforce the order of removal. The motion is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent contends that the time limit for filing her motion should be equitably tolled because she received ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent also contends that the Board should reopen proceedings sua sponte, or under section 240 (c)(7)(C)(iv) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229 (c)(7)(C)(iv). In support of her motion, the respondent has submitted a large number of documents, as well as two supplemental motions with evidence. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes reopening.
 
The respondent has substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (lst Cir. 1988). See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741, 745-46 (4th Cir. 2006). The respondent contends that former counsel provided ineffective assistance at the hearing, on appeal, and failed to provide her notice of the Board’s decision. In support of her claims, the respondent’s current employer asserts that the respondent’s file did not include letters from former counsel regarding the pending appeal or the Board’s decision. The respondent also contends that she made payments after the Board dismissed the appeal, which supports her assertion that she did not have notice of the Board’s decision.
 
a review of the record does not indicate that the respondent’s former counsel provided ineffective assistance at either the hearing or on appeal. The fact that the respondent did not obtain relief, the denial of which was based on her own misrepresentations, does not mean that her former counsel was ineffective. Further, we agree with the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that the respondent’s former counsel did not provide ineffective assistance during her appeal because her former counsel contacted her during the pendency of her appeal, but she did not respond or pay her fees in accordance with his letter dated April 6, 2005. Moreover, after the Board issued its decision, the respondent’s former counsel mailed a copy of the decision to the respondent at her last known address. See Motion to Reopen, Exh. C, Letter dated July 24, 2005. The respondent’s assertions regarding lack of notice are given minimal weight, given that the Immigration Judge previously found that she misrepresented facts to obtain an immigration benefit, that she concealed information, and was not forthcoming (I.J. Dec. dated 5/21/04 at 3-4). The fact that the respondent did not provide copies of her former attorney’s letters to her current employer does not establish lack of notice. Similarly, making several payments of $100 to former counsel after the Board’s decision was issued does not necessarily establish that the respondent did not have notice of our decision. Further, the respondent failed to demonstrate that she exercised due diligence in seeking reopening. See Chao v. Virginia Department of Transportation, 291 F.3d 276, 283 (4th Cir. 2002)(equitable tolling is not available when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf). The Immigration Judge issued his decision in 2004, we summarily dismissed the appeal in 2005, and the respondent was provided with notice of our decision soon thereafter, but did not hire new counsel until after the DHS contacted her in 2007. Even if the respondent did not have notice of our decision, her assertions of due diligence are not plausible given the passage of time from the Immigration Judge’s decision to the filing of the instant motion, the Immigration Judge’s prior findings of misrepresentation, former counsel’s assertions that he attempted to contact the respondent during the pendency of the appeal, but the respondent did not respond to his telephone calls, and the follow-up letter from the respondent’s former counsel mailed during the pendency of the appeal. The respondent’s motion to reopen under section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv) is also denied because it is based on the same allegations and facts previously presented to, and rejected by, the Immigration Judge. We do not view section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv) as an opportunity for an illegal alien to relitigate the same issues previously presented and rejected. Further, the respondent’s current motion under section 240(C)(7)(C)(iv) is untimely, and a review of the record, including the motion to reopen, and supplements, do not provide sufficient evidence of extraordinary circumstances or extreme hardship to her children so as to justify an exception to the time-bar. We decline, moreover, to reopen sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999) (fundamental change in law may warrant sua sponte reopening notwithstanding otherwise applicable time and number limitations on motions); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997)(Board retains limited discretionary power under the regulations to reopen or reconsider only in exceptional circumstances).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
June Zhou, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James D. Paoli
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on December 29, 2005, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s March 30, 2005, denial of a motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order issued on February 25, 2005.
 
On November 30, 2007, the respondent, a native and citizen of China, filed a motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order. Under section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances. The respondent acknowledges that his motion is untimely, but seeks equitable tolling of the 180-day deadline because his motion is premised on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his former attorney, Mr. Xu.
 
The respondent’s motion will be denied for two reasons. First, it is untimely filed. The respondent seeks equitable tolling of the 180-day motions deadline based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has held that the deadline for motions to reopen deportation proceedings may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iavorski v. United States INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000). Aliens relying on equitable tolling must establish that (1) their constitutional right to due process was violated by counsel’s conduct; and (2) they exercised due diligence during the period sought to be tolled. Id.
 
We find that equitable tolling is not warranted in this case where the respondent has failed to exercise due diligence in pursing his case. The respondent’s prior motion to reopen, which was also premised on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, was denied two years ago because the respondent failed to comply with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Nor is this motion supported by evidence that he has complied with Lozada. He has simply failed to show that he exercised due diligence during the period sought to be tolled. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2nd Cir. 2006) (finding that aliens had demonstrated that their counsel was ineffective in informing them that they did not need to appear at a hearing, but they had not met their burden of showing why they had not been diligent over a two-year period).
 
*2 The respondent’s motion to reopen these removal proceedings will also be denied as number barred. Federal regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(D) provide an exception to the one-motion rule when a motion seeking to rescind an in absentia order is filed. However, that exception is limited to motions that are filed in deportation and exclusion proceedings. There is no equivalent exception in removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3) (providing an exception only to the time, but not to the numerical, restrictions on motions in removal proceedings); 1003.23(b)(4)(h), (iii)(D). Thus, unless another exception is shown to apply, the respondent’s second motion is number barred.
 
Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion is denied as time and number barred.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
  
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Linda Osberg-Braun, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. By decision mailed August 7, 2007, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia, and thereafter on October 1, 2007, denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent has filed a timely Notice of Appeal from the latter decision. The matter will be remanded.
 
The respondent contends that he filed a change of address with the Department of Homeland Security prior to the initiation of these proceedings, and that the DHS thus erred in not sending the Notice to Appear to his new, correct address, an error repeated by the Immigration Court when it sent the notice for the August 7, 2007, hearing date. Alternatively, the respondent contends that his order of removal in absentia should be rescinded because his former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to correct the address error, and in failing to enter an appearance with the Immigration Court, which would have resulted in counsel receiving the hearing notice.
 
We find the respondent’s first argument unavailing. He admits to having received the Notice to Appear (NTA), which was sent to his former address and forwarded to him by the Postal Service. At that point, he was on notice that the address on the NTA was defective, and he was under obligation, as clearly stated in the NTA, to notify the Immigration Court of his current address. His failure to do so, which resulted in the sending of the Notice of Hearing for August 7, 2007, cannot be excused under the law of the applicable Circuit nor of this Board. Dominguez v. United States Att’y Gen’l, 284 F.3d 1258 (11th Cir. 2002); Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001). The respondent’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are first presented on appeal, and their resolution will require findings of fact that are best resolved in the first instance by the Immigration Judge. The respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), with respect to Mr. Soto, his former counsel. While there is evidence that the respondent hired Mr. Soto to represent him in “deportation” proceedings, and while the respondent contends on appeal that he informed Mr. Soto of the initiation of these removal proceedings, there is no response as yet from Mr. Soto. The Immigration Judge on remand shall re-consider the respondent’s motion to reopen the in absentia order of removal in light of the new claims presented regarding alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed with respect to the issues presented in the respondent’s initial motion to reopen, and the proceedings are remanded for further consideration of that motion in light of the new allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Amen Omo Obas, Esquire¿FN1º
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Gerrie Zhang
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated August 17, 2005. On August 17, 2005, the Board affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s request for a continuance based on a pending application for labor certification, denied a motion to remand for adjustment of status based on the approval of the labor certification of the respondent’s wife on April 11, 2005, and reinstated a grant of voluntary departure. On October 28, 2005, we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our decision on the merits. A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. The respondent’s motion to reopen, filed on August 2, 2007, seeks reopening for consideration of adjustment of status and/or cancellation of removal and is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The motion is denied as untimely filed.
 
The respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). We find that under the facts alleged ineffective assistance of counsel has not been shown. In the complaint filed with the Texas Bar, the respondent asserts, inter alia, that his former attorney did not timely file an appeal of his case with this Board. However, the record reveals that the appeal was, in fact, timely filed. In the motion to reopen, the respondent contends that his former attorney should have filed a timely motion to reopen for consideration of cancellation of removal and/or adjustment of status. The only potential qualifying relative for cancellation of removal mentioned in the current motion is the respondent’s wife, who became a lawful permanent resident on March 9, 2006, more than 90 days after our August 17, 2005, decision. Consequently, the respondent could not have shown that he had prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal or adjustment of status so as to timely file a motion to reopen. Contrary to the respondent’s contentions, the Board itself and Immigration Judges are without authority to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel against the DHS so as to preclude it from undertaking a lawful course of action that it is empowered to pursue by statute and regulation. See Matter of Hernandez-Puente, 20 I&N Dec. 335, 338 (BIA 1991). Moreover, we also decline to reopen sua sponte. Simply acquiring additional equities after a final order of removal does not establish an exceptional situation that would support circumventing the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship. The f£.ct that the respondent’s wife is now a lawful permanent resident and he is the beneficiary of a pending visa petition for derivative adjustment does not provide a basis for sua sponte reopening.See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied as untimely, and the request for a stay of removal is denied.

On November 30, 2007, the respondent submitted a supplement to his motion to reopen which we have considered on appeal. Although the respondent used the term “pro se” in this supplement, he did not indicate that he was no longer represented by Amen Omo Obas, Esquire, who submitted a Form EOIR-27 on September 27, 2007. Amen Omo Obas, Esquire, has not submitted a motion to withdraw as counsel. Consequently, we consider Amen Omo Obas as the attorney of record.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph C. Sekula, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on October 3, 2006, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. In a prior decision dated December 22, 2004, we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal because he failed to file a brief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E) (2007). In denying his subsequent motion to reopen, we found that the respondent failed to establish that he was the subject of ineffective assistance of counsel such that his untimely request for reopening should be granted. The respondent did not comply with the procedural requirements for such a claim set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98, 106 (3d Cir. 2005), Furthermore, we found that the respondent had failed to establish that his former attorney’s actions caused him prejudice because the relief for which he sought reopening - a visa petition with which to obtain adjustment of status - was not available to him for three reasons: (1) the respondent is inadmissible for having failed to reveal that his mother, who had filed a visa petition on the respondent’s behalf, had passed away before the visa was issued; (2) the respondent failed to apply for a waiver of the ground of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i); and (3) the respondent failed to establish prima facie eligibility for relief by providing a sponsor if granted reinstatement of his visa petition. We also noted that both a waiver of inadmissibility and adjustment of status under section 212(i) and 245 of the Act, 8 U.s.c. §§ 1182(i), 1255, are discretionary and, therefore, in light of his fraud, not relief he would merit.
 
On June 1, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit granted the government’s unopposed motion to remand. That motion correctly noted that a lawful permanent resident is not viewed as seeking admission with. 6 exceptions.¿FN1º See section 101(a)(13)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 (a)(13)(C). The government’s motion asserts that the Notice to Appear lacks specificity in that it does not indicate which exception applies to the respondent. Although the respondent admits that he did not specifically raise this issue in his motion to reopen (Respondent’s Motion before the Third Circuit at 6-7), he argued that he was clearly prejudiced by his former attorney’s failure to argue that the factual allegations in the Notice to Appear do not support a finding of removability under section 212 of the Act.
 
*2 At the outset, we note that the respondent has apparently been removed from the United States (Respondent’s Br. Before the Third Circuit). We generally decline to render an opinion in such cases because our regulations specify that departure during the pendency of an appeal constitutes withdrawal of said appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.4; but see Chong v. District Direction, INS, 264 F.3d 378 (3d Cir. 2001) (holding that sufficient collateral consequences flowed from the Board’s order of removal that the case remained worthy of review despite the alien’s deportation). However, since the Circuit Court has mandated an answer to the questions raised in the government’s motion, we understand that mandate to govern this remand.
 
We find that the Notice to Appear alleges adequate facts with which to find the respondent removable as charged.¿FN2º In essence, the Notice alleges that the respondent never lawfully obtained permanent resident status because he obtained his status through fraud: he failed to reveal that his mother, who had filed a visa petition on his behalf, was deceased. Once fraud of this character is established, the respondent would not qualify as a lawful permanent resident relieved of the “admission” construct upon return from a trip abroad. See Matter of Koloamatangi, 23 I&N Dec. 548 (BIA 2003) (finding an alien who acquired permanent resident status through fraud or misrepresentation has never been “lawfully admitted for permanent residence” and was, therefore, ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)).
 
As before, we also decline to remand based on allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. In Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000), we stated that where an alien has filed an untimely motion to reopen alleging that the DHS failed to prove the alien’s removability, the burden of proof no longer lies with the DHS to establish removability, but shifts to the alien to demonstrate that an exceptional situation exists that warrants reopening by the Board on its own motion. It is not sufficient for the respondent to argue, as he did in his brief to the Third Circuit, that he could have provided explanations or defenses for the alleged fraud which might exculpate him. As we stated in Matter of Beckford, supra, “¿nºotwithstanding any possible problems with the Immigration Judge’s handling of the hearing or with the actions (or inaction) of previous counsel, the respondent, at a minimum, needed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood that the result in his case would be changed if reopening is granted.” ld. at 1219.
 
The respondent has not adequately shown that he was unaware that his mother was deceased at the time his visa was granted and that he had no role in obtaining the visa by fraud. And, even assuming that the respondent’s sister completed the paperwork for the adjustment of status application or that the visa application was not signed by the respondent, he was still not entitled to the visa or to the resident alien status it provided. Therefore, he was not entitled to this immigration benefit.
 
*3 Furthermore, the fact that he may have been qualified to seek other remedies is now irrelevant in that he was never entitled to the entry document he received. The possible relief for which he might have applied, including a waiver of inadmissibility, is discretionary and we have no way of knowing the outcome if the respondent had disclosed the truth and timely applied for such relief without pursuing his fraud. At this stage, the respondent’s attempts to remedy his fraud, or to excuse the improper receipt of permanent resident status, do not constitute exceptional circumstances which would warrant reopening on the basis of an untimely motion.¿FN3º
 
ORDER: The Board’s October 3, 2006, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen is affirmed.

We note that it is clear that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) became aware of the alleged fraud in the respondent’s and his siblings’ visa petition applications in 1999 and the agency intended not to grant their applications for lawful permanent residency. However, other evidence of record establishes that the respondent did adjust his status during that same year (Exh. 2). There is no evidence to establish that this status was ever rescinded.

2

We note the respondent’s argument before the Third Circuit that the DHS officer who issued the Notice to Appear failed to describe his title. According to the respondent, this, along with the fact that the Notice was served on the respondent a month after he attempted to enter, entitle the respondent to termination. However, the fact that the officer’s title was abbreviated as “II” or left off certain lines in the Notice to Appear is not a defect which warrants termination. As we stated in our previous order, at footnote 1, the regulations do not specify the format with which a title must be listed. See 8 C.F.R. § 239.1; see also Diaz-Soto v. INS, 797 F.2d 262 (5th Cir. 1986) (finding that the charging document need not require the actual signature of the Immigration and Naturalization Service official authorized to issue such documents). We decline to find, as suggested by the respondent, that the lack of title means the respondent would have been admitted as a lawful permanent resident because the DHS cannot meet its burden under the regulations.

In light of our decision, we decline to address the respondent’s arguments that our previous decision took on a formulaic view of the respondent’s ineffective assistance claims or that it ignored or confused the other issues raised (Respondent’s Br. Before the Third Circuit at 36-47). See Zheng v. Gonzales, supra, at 106 (noting that strict, formulaic view of motions alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, or those in which the alien fails to meet the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, are disfavored).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nhu H. Muon, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on March 22, 2006, because he failed to appear for a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on December 4, 2006, but the Immigration Judge denied it on January 30, 2007. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that he was the victim of negligent advice provided to him by an individual purporting to be an attorney and such prevented him from attending his hearing. He argues that he established that his failure to appear was caused by an exceptional circumstance. The respondent indicates in his declaration that he received the Notice to Appear reflecting that his hearing would be held on May 2, 2006. He further indicates that he subsequently received the heating notice, and it indicated that his hearing would be held on March 22, 2006. According to the respondent, the non-attorney instructed him that the hearing date on the Notice to Appear controlled. He argues that he should not be penalized for relying on the incorrect advice given by an individual who he believed was an attorney. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision and his reliance on Singh-Bhathal v. INS, 170 F.3d 943 (9th Cir. 1999) (alien’s acceptance of advice of immigration consultant not to appear at deportation hearing does not constitute exceptional circumstance that would excuse his absence from hearing).
 
A claim alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy certain procedural requirements. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Among them is the requirement that the individual accused of negligence be informed of the allegation raised before the Immigration Court or the Board and allowed an opportunity to respond. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2003) (noting that the purpose of the notice requirement is to allow the prior counsel an opportunity to contest the allegations of ineffective assistance so that the adjudicator can more accurately assess the claim). Herein, the respondent filed a complaint against the non-attorney, but he has not provided the individual with an opportunity to reply to the allegation raised in these instant proceedings. Consequently, the Board and the Immigration Judge cannot assess the respondent’s accounts against the accounts of the non-attorney. We will not find that the respondent was the victim of attorney negligence under these circumstances. It follows that the respondent has not shown that exceptional circumstances prevented his appearance for his hearing. We therefore need not address whether the motion to reopen was timely filed.
 
*2 The respondent further argues on appeal that he was not adequately notified of the hearing because neither the charging document nor the hearing notice were written in Spanish. However, the respondent admits that he received both documents, and understood his obligation to appear for a hearing. He also states in his declaration that his failure to attend his hearing was caused by a non-attorney advising not to appear in Immigration Court on the date reflected on the Notice of Hearing. Clearly, the respondent’s failure to appear was not caused by the hearing notice not being written in Spanish. We therefore cannot find that the respondent had no notice of his hearing. There is also no requirement that notices be translated into the respondent’s native language. See generally Lopes v. Gonzales, 468 F.3d 81 (2nd Cir. 2006). This aspect of the appeal is dismissed.
 
Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed, and the appeal is dismissed.

December 20, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio Salazar, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the December 4, 2006, decision of the Immigration Judge. The respondent’s removability under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”) is not at issue on appeal. 8 U.S.C.§ 1182(a)6)(E)(i). The respondent does contends that she was entitled to the relief of cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act as a lawful permanent resident and that the Immigration Judge failed to properly balance the adverse factors of record against those favorable to her. The respondent also alleges that there were due process violations that tainted these proceedings. We find her claims to be without support in the record or legal merit. The denial of relief will be affirmed and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
We find that the Immigration Judge was thorough in his consideration of the record. We agree that the respondent’s equities include her long residence here; family ties and the presence of three United States citizen children;¿FN1º hardship; and her past employment history. However, these equities are outweighed by the unfavorable factors of record which include a criminal record for smuggling and prostitution, an earlier, undisclosed incident of smuggling as well as an adverse credibility finding which is amply supported by the record and undermines any claim she can show rehabilitation (I.J. at 17-19). We agree therefore in the denial of relief. To the extent she contends that the Immigration Judge employed a heightened standard of proof, this claim is without merit. Brief on Appeal at 32-33. Her application for relief was filed on June 13, 2006, or after May 11, 2005, so, her credibility as it related to meeting her burden of proof was properly judged under the REAL ID. Act of 2005.
 
The respondent separately challenges the result in her case on due process grounds. First, she asserts that the Immigration Judge was biased. Brief on Appeal at 21. She fails to point out when he was biased in these proceedings and nowhere does the record bear out her claim. Accordingly, we dismiss it. Secondly, she contends that the government failed to produce Exhibit 8, Form G-166 (Report of Investigation) and Exhibit 9, Form I-213 (Record of Deportable/ Inadmissible Alien), in a timely fashion and that its late submission prejudiced her ability to prepare her case and correctly recollect her prior statements at the time of her arrest for smuggling. The record indicates that these documents were offered by the government as rebuttal evidence, however, to impeach the respondent’s testimony. The Immigration Judge properly overruled the respondent’s objection to the introduction of these documents below (Tr. at 75). Moreover, while claiming prejudice, the respondent’s position on appeal is that notwithstanding the problems she faced preparing her case, the record and her equities “compel” a grant of this appeal. Brief on Appeal at 24. We therefore find she cannot establish prejudice since the late introduction of these documents did not preclude her from presenting her case, even if the government was required to present these documents at an earlier stage in the proceedings. We observe that the respondent is not contesting any of the information contained in exhibits 8 and 9; she simply wishes that had she remembered what she told the officer at the time, she would have testified consistent with those statements at her hearing. Brief on Appeal at 12, 18. Because she is not contesting the truth of the information contained in these exhibits, we find no support for her assertions now that the documents should have been authenticated or certified, too.
 
*2 Lastly, the respondent indirectly claims that she was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of her prior counsel. See Brief on Appeal at 18, fn. 2 and 24. She believes her in-court testimony in particular would have been better prepared, the Immigration Judge would not have concluded she lacked credibility, and her equities generally would have been better presented. Yet, none of the requirements for properly asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), have been met. Additionally, the respondent has not shown, as with her other due process claims, that she was actually prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
The appeal is dismissed.

Some contention is made on appeal that the respondent’s parents and siblings should have been considered in this application for relief. However, the respondent, who has the burden of proof in this application, chose not to present supporting evidence from her family members because she did not want them to know she was in removal proceedings (I.J. at 10). See also Tr. at 42-43.

IN RE: ISOLDA CASTILLO-MONTENEGRO A.K.A. ISOLDA CASTILLO A.K.A. FABRIOLA MARTINEZ
FILE: AXX XX3 309 - LOS ANGELES, CA
December 17, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Keili M. Reynolds, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; remand
 
In a decision dated February 13, 2006, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The respondent has appealed. During the pendency of her appeal the respondent filed a motion to reopen, which we will treat as a motion to remand. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion granted.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nicaragua, was convicted on January 5, 1995, in the Municipal Court of Los Angeles, Van Nuys Judicial District, State of California, for the offense of petty theft in violation of section 490.1 of the California Penal Code. (Exhs. 2, 4). The respondent was also convicted on April 20, 1999, in the Municipal Court of Los Angeles, Van Nuys Judicial District, State of California, for the offense of theft of property in violation of 484(a) of the California Penal Code. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent, who was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1994, could not demonstrate 7 years continuous residence necessary for cancellation of removal because her theft conviction in 1999 triggered the “stop time” rule and ended the respondent’s period of continuous physical presence. See section 240A(d)(l) of the Act.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that she is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A of the Act under the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, decisions in Lepe-Guitron v. INS, 16 F.3d 1021 (9th Cir. 1994), and Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2005). Specifically, the respondent argues that because her father became a lawful permanent resident in 1989 that she should be able to impute his 7 years of lawful permanent residence status (Respondent’s Brief at 3).
 
In Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2005), the Ninth Circuit decided to extend its decision in Lepe-Guitron v. INS, supra, finding that “for purposes of satisfying the seven-years of continuous residence ‘after having been admitted in any status’ required for cancellation of removal…., a parent’s admission for permanent residence status is imputed to the parent’s unemancipated minor children residing with the parent.” Id. at 1029. In that case, the alien had entered the United States with his parents in 1985 and his mother attained lawful permanent residence in 1990, when he was 7 years old. Id. at 1016. The alien in that case obtained his lawful residency on December 4, 1997, when he was 14 years old. Id. Subsequently, on October 16, 2002, the alien was convicted of a burglary offense and was placed into removal proceedings. Id. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the alien in Cuevas- Gaspar had established the 7 years continuous residence for purposes of section 240A of the Act because he could “tack on” the approximately 7 years of his mother’s permanent residency prior to his own, namely 1990 through December 4, 1997. Thus, despite the fact that the alien ceased accumulating continuous residence sometime in 2002 at which time he had only acquired approximately 4 years in his own right, he had accumulated 7 years continuous residence when “tacking on” that of his mother when he was an “unemancipated minor.” Id.
 
*2 Cuevas-Gaspar and Lepe-Guitron allows for the imputation of the parents’ permanent residency to the child based upon the child’s status as an “unemancipated minor,” (emphasis added). Here, the respondent was admitted to the United States in 1994 as a lawful permanent resident on May 23, 1994, when she was approximately 17 1/2 years old. At most, the respondent would be able to impute less than 6 months of her father’s lawful permanent residency before she turned 18 and no longer qualified as an “unemancipated minor child residing with the parent.” Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, supra. We do not view the rationale in these cases to allow the respondent to accumulate her period of permanent residency for a time in which she was not residing with a lawful permanent parent as an “unemancipated minor.”As a result, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent is ineligible for cancellation of removal.
 
We next turn to the respondent’s motion to remand seeking an opportunity to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act. The respondent contends that because of the ineffective assistance of her prior counsel she did not apply for this form of relief, although she was eligible for such a waiver. At the outset, we find that the respondent has complied with the technical requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In addition, “substantial prejudice” must be shown; such prejudice means that the alleged ineffectiveness affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000). Based upon the record before us, it appears that the respondent may be eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, and that competent counsel should have applied for such a waiver. Accordingly, we will grant the motion and remand for consideration of the respondent’s eligibility for a waiver under section 212(h) of the Act.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is granted and the record remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
CERTIFICATION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Charles H. Kuck, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Arthur S. Raznick
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On November 21,2005, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States in absentia because she failed to appear for her hearing. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on December 12, 2005, but that request was denied on January 27, 2006. The respondent filed a timely appeal from this decision. On August 8, 2006, the Board remanded the record to the Immigration Court to address with specificity the respondent’s argument that her good faith confusion regarding the time of her hearing combined with the alleged negligence of her former counsel constitutes an “exceptional circumstance” to excuse her failure to appear. After considering this argument, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen on September 25, 2006, and certified the record back to the Board. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he or she did not receive proper notice of the time and place of the hearing, or because he or she was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of his or her own. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act. In this case, the only issue is whether the respondent failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances.
 
In her motion to reopen, the respondent explained that she did not appear for her hearing because she mistakenly believed that it was scheduled for November 21, 2005, at 4:30 p.m., rather than at 8:30 a.m. She reported discussing her case with her former attorney the month before the hearing, and advised him that she was relocating to Georgia but would return for the 4:30 p.m. hearing. Although the respondent mentioned the incorrect time for the hearing, her prior counsel did not correct her misunderstanding. The respondent received a telephone call from her former attorney when she arrived at the airport in Phoenix, Arizona at approximately 10:00 a.m. on the day of the hearing, and he asked why she failed to appear. After explaining that an order of removal had been issued in absentia, the respondent’s prior counsel instructed her to drive directly to the courthouse because he planned to advise the Immigration Judge that there was a misunderstanding about the time of the hearing and that she was on her way. According to the respondent, he called her approximately a half an hour later to instruct her to drive to his office. When the respondent’s husband asked whether they could go to the courthouse to explain that they were late for the hearing due to “an honest mistake,” her former attorney explained that all of the hearings for the rest of the day had been canceled and the court was closed because a court employee was having a baby. The respondent maintains that her prior counsel exercised poor judgment when he advised her to drive to his office rather than the courthouse because she could have arrived less than 2 hours late and explained her tardiness. Further, she argues that her former attorney was negligent in failing to file her application for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c).
 
*2 The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent failed to establish exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear at the hearing on November 21, 2005, based on her confusion regarding the scheduled time. See Valencia-Fragoso v. INS, 321 F.3d 1204 (9th Cir. 2003) (alien’s alleged misunderstanding of time of hearing did not constitute exceptional circumstances justifying reopening). Although the respondent submitted evidence showing that she complied with the requirements enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), she failed to establish that she suffered any prejudice due to her former counsel’s actions. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9thCir. 2004); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241,1246 (9th Cir. 2000). Compliance with the procedural aspects of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel alone is not sufficient to warrant reopening. To prove a Fifth Amendment due process violation, the respondent must show both error from the ineffective assistance of counsel, and that she suffered prejudice as a result of that error. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent was notified of the date and time of her hearing, and she was responsible for ensuring her attendance. The fact that her prior counsel failed to correct her when she misstated the time of her hearing does not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel because the respondent has not shown that she was incapable of recording the proper time and making the necessary arrangements to appear at her hearing, or that her former attorney was obligated to verify that she recalled the information correctly. While the respondent suggests that her prior counsel erred in directing her to come to his office instead of the courthouse, she acknowledged that these instructions were given approximately 30 minutes after he advised her to drive directly to the courthouse and that he subsequently explained that the court was closed before she could arrive. Although the respondent argues that her prior attorney committed error when he failed to seek a section 212(c) waiver of inadmissibility, the Immigration Judge explained that the respondent’s former counsel was prepared to present arguments in support of this form of relief at the November 21, 2005, hearing. Consequently, we conclude that the respondent has not shown prejudice flowing from the alleged errors. We find that based upon the evidence of record, the respondent has not met the burden of demonstrating exceptional circumstances under the statute. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher J. Slender, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Donald W. Pearcy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration and Reopening
 
This case was last before the Board on November 15, 2002, when we returned the record to the Immigration Court without further action because the respondent withdrew his appeal from the Immigration Judge’s May 21, 2002, decision finding the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), and ordering him removed from the United States as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. The respondent now appeals from the Immigration Judge’s January 16, 2007, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider and reopen proceedings based upon ineffective assistance of counsel and an intervening change in the law. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
As an initial matter, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion to reconsider and reopen was untimely.¿FN1º 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23.
 
In 2001, the respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, and a lawful permanent resident, was convicted of unlawfully taking and driving a vehicle in violation of section 10851(a) of the California Vehicle Code and was sentenced to a 365 day term of imprisonment. Even assuming for the sake of discussion that the respondent’s motion had been timely filed, we conclude the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider because in 2002 she correctly relied upon Matter of V-Z-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 1338 (BIA 2000) (holding that the offense defined by section 10851(a) of the California Vehicle Code qualifies categorically as a “theft offense” under section 101 (a)(43)(G) of the Act). In other words, the respondent’s untimely motion before the Immigration Judge presented no legal argument, change of law, or overlooked argument or aspect of the case that would establish that, based on the law as it existed in 2002, the Immigration Judge erred in her prior conclusion. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57 (BIA 2006).
 
The respondent contends that he is eligible for equitable tolling because his previous counsel withdrew his appeal from the Immigration Judge’s May 21, 2002, decision and the respondent alleges he did not learn of the former counsel’s actions and ineffective representation until 2006. Respondent’s Brief at 2. We conclude that the respondent did not act with due diligence because he failed to demonstrate a steadfast pursuit of his case throughout proceedings before the agency. Cf. Ghahremani v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 993 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding due diligence where alien was steadfast in pursuit of relief, including continual investigation and hiring two other attorneys, in unbroken efforts to retain competent counsel and file motion to reopen). Rather, the respondent delayed contacting current counsel to inquire about the status of his case until 2005, nearly 3 years after his previous counsel filed his appeal. In addition, the respondent has failed to adequately explain why he failed to investigate and pursue relief from removal during this time period.
 
*2 In the alternative, even if the respondent established due diligence, we cannot say that the previous counsel’s act of withdrawing the respondent’s appeal constituted ineffective assistance, given the state of the law at the time the appeal was withdrawn in 2002. See Matter of V-Z-S-, supra. We also note that the respondent has not complied with all of the procedural requirements for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and the record does not show a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 5587-88 (9th Cir. 2006), and the cases cited therein.
 
The rationale in the Penuliar case cited by the respondent has been repudiated by the United States Supreme Court in Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez. See Penuliar v. Ashcroft, 395 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir. 2005), petition for reh’g denied, 435 F.3d 961 (9th Cir. 2006); Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 127 S. Ct. 815 (2007). Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit’s decision in United States v. Vidal, 504 F.3d 1072 (9th Cir. 2007) does not provide the respondent with plausible grounds for relief, since the respondent was not convicted under section 10851 (a) as an accessory after the fact. Rather, the respondent plead guilty to driving a motor vehicle and knowing it was stolen, which reflects that the respondent was convicted as a principal. Exhibit 2. The respondent, therefore, stands convicted of an aggravated felony, and his argument on appeal is foreclosed by Duenas-Alvarez, supra. Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER; The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: ARTUR0 LOPEZ GUITIERREZ

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mario Acosta, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
 
CHARGE:
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 13, 2007, denying the respondent!s motion to reopen. An Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent deported in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on November 14, 1996. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge found that there was no good cause to toll the 180-day deadline for the entirety of the 10 year period that elapsed since the respondent received the Immigration Court’s in absentia order of deportation. He also determined that even if timely, the respondent failed to establish exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. Specifically, the Immigration Judge found that pursuant to the holding of the Ninth Circuit in Singh-Bhathal v. INS, 170 F.3d 943 (9th Cir, 1999), the respondcnt’s voluntary choice to follow the advice of an immigration consultant instead of the notice of bearing issued by the Immigration Court is not an exceptional circumstance. The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s request for sua sponte reopening.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that he has established exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear for the hearing on November 14, 1996, due to ineffective assistance of counsel. He also asserts that he was prejudiced by the actions of the immigration consultant that assisted him, and that he exercised due diligence in seeking to reopen his deportation proceedings.
 
We find that the respondent has established ineffective assistance of counsel, as he relied on the advice of an immigration consultant who falsely represented herself to be a lawyer, that it was not necessary for him to appear for his hearing. See Monjaraz-Munoz, 327 F.3d 892 (9th Cir. 2003) (if an alien fails to appear because of his actual and reasonable reliance on counsel’s erroneous advice, it can constitute a circumstance beyond the alien’s control); see also Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999)(the statute of limitations to reopen an order of deportation is equitably tolled where the alien’s late petition is the result of deceptive actions by a representative); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
However, we find that the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent’s motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel was filed untimely, even if equitable tolling is taken into consideration. See I.J. Dec. dated April 12, 2007. In Fajardo v. INS, 300 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2002), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the limitation period on motions to reopen based on exceptional circumstances must be tolled until the alien was aware of the harm resulting from his two former attorney’s misconduct. While equitable tolling is available for untimely motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in pursing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See e.g. RodriguezLariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir.); Socop-Gonzalez, 272 F.3d 1176; Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). As noted by the Immigration Judge, according to the respondent’s own declaration, he received the in absentia deportation order in November 1996, and by January 1997, the respondent was fully aware that Ms. Dorantes had defrauded him because he learned that she was being investigated by authorities, and that criminal charges had been brought against her. See Respondcnt’s Declaration, dated March 1, 2007. The respondent claims that since March 1997, he has consulted with three different attorneys, all of whom informed him that he did not have a case and he would not be able to reopen his proceedings. However, the respondent states that prior to meeting with his current counsel in August 2006, he last met with an attorney in late 2003. In his declaration, the respondent avers that if he had known there was something he could do, such as filing a motion, he would have done it in a beartbeat because he wanted to have a meaningful day in court.
 
*2 The respondent has failed to establish that he acted with due diligence required for equitable tolling. The respondent concedes that in November 1996, he received the in absentia order of deportation from the Los Angeles Immigration Court. The respondent was informed that the Immigration Judge’s decision was final unless a motion to reopen is filed with the Immigration Court in accordance with Section 242B(c)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252B(c)(3), and the respondent was provided with the address of the Los Angeles Immigration Court. Yet the respondent never inquired with the Immigration Court after receiving the in absentia order of deportation in November 1996, to pursue reopening through filing a motion to reopen with the court. Moreover, the respondent did not seek out any counsel regarding his in absentia order of deportation from late 2003 until August 2006, at which time he met with current counsel. Even if we accept that prior counsel was ineffective and failed to advise the respondent that he was required to attand the hearing on November 14, 1996, the respondcnt’s assertions of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be overcome by the lack of respondcnt’s due diligence in pursuing his case. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vladislav Sirota, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º -Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact (AXX XXX XXX & AXX XXX XXX)
 
Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document (all respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondents, natives and citizens of Georgia, have timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s September 24, 2007, decision. The respondents contend that the Immigration Judge erred in denying their untimely motion to reopen. The respondents request that we stay their removal from the United States. The stay request will be denied and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
We adopt the procedural history set forth in the Immigration Judge’s September 24, 2007, decision. As set forth in the Immigration Judge’s order, in addition to the respondents’ most recent motion to reopen, the respondents previously filed two other motions to reopen. Inasmuch as the respondents are limited, with certain exceptions, to filing one motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondents’ motion is number-barred and should be denied on that basis. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
The respondents also contend that the proceedings should be reopened because of their prior counsel’s ineffective assistance. The respondents contend that they have complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998). In Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639, we held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the claim reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. However, as set forth in the Immigration Judge’s order, the respondents failed to submit an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with their prior counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondents in this regard. Inasmuch as the respondents failed to include an affidavit as required, we agree with the Immigration Judge that they failed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 Lastly, the respondents argue that proceedings should be reopened so that the lead respondent may apply for asylum due to his lengthy absence from Georgia and involuntary renunciation of his Georgian citizenship. However, the regulations concerning motions to reopen before an Immigration Judge only waive the time and numerical limitations for motions to reopen based on “changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality” not personal circumstances as described in the respondents’ motion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Based on the foregoing, we find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondents’ motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondents’ request for a stay of removal is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael Wishnie, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Susan Egan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)º - Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
The respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s August 23, 2007, decision denying her motion to reconsider the Immigration Judge’s June 27, 2007, denial of her motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order entered against her on June 5, 1997, will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nicaragua, was originally placed into these proceedings with the issuance of an Order to Show Cause on July 24, 1990 (Exh. 1). According to the record, a Notice of Appearance was filed on the respondent’s behalf by an accredited representative on June 25, 1992. On July 28, 1993, the respondent, through her accredited representative, conceded deportability as charged and accepted voluntary departure for a year or until July 27, 1994. Subsequently, after failing to depart, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge seeking suspension of deportation under NACARA. On October 15, 1996, over the objection of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service), the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
The record reflects that a Notice of Appearance was filed on behalf of the respondent by an attorney on September 6, 1996. On October 22, 1996, the respondent’s counsel was sent a Notice of Hearing by certified mailing notifying the respondent of a hearing scheduled on her application for suspension of deportation on February 13, 1997. After the respondent failed to appear at this scheduled heating, her case was postponed until June 5, 1997. On April 3, 1997, the respondent’s counsel was sent by certified mail a Notice of Hearing for June 5, 1997, and a signed return receipt was received by the Immigration Court. However, the respondent again failed to appear and an in absentia order, of removal was entered against her on that date. Subsequently, 10 years later, the respondent, through new counsel, filed the instant motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order on June 20, 2007, arguing that she did not receive proper notice of her prior June 5, 1997, hearing and also arguing changed country conditions in Nicaragua affecting her claim. According to the respondent, no notice of hearing was sent to her address.
 
On June 27, 2007, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind her in absentia order of removal (I.J. at 1-2). The Immigration Judge noted the respondent’s appearance at her July 28, 1993, hearing and the grant of voluntary departure (I.J. at 1-2). In regard to the respondent’s scheduled June 5, 1997, hearing in relation to the grant of her motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge noted the inclusion in the record of the Notice of Hearing for the June 5, 1997, heating sent to respondent’s counsel and returned with a signed return receipt (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge also noted the respondent’s admission as to having departed the United States on February 15, 1997, after the filing of her motion to reopen but prior to the hearing (I.J. at 2). The respondent remained outside of the United States until 2001 (I.J. at 2). As a result, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent’s motion was untimely and that she did not have jurisdiction over the respondent’s motion under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (2007), which bars the filing of a motion to reopen on behalf of a person subject to proceedings subsequent to departure from the United States (I.J. at 3-4). The Immigration Judge also noted that she would have denied the motion in discretion given the respondent’s previous immigration history (I.J. at 3-4).
 
*2 On July 23, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge contending for the first time that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel alleging that her attorney failed to notify her of the scheduled hearings and the possibility of an in absentia order. See Respondent’s Motion at 2. The respondent further alleged that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that her motion was untimely filed because of the ineffective assistance of counsel and that she was without jurisdiction because, the respondent argued, she did not depart the United States while she was subject to a final order of removal inasmuch as the motion to reopen had already been granted. Id. at 3 (emphasis added). The respondent alleged that she was facially eligible, for suspension of deportation. The DHS opposed the respondent’s motion arguing that the Immigration Judge had no jurisdiction under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), and that the respondent failed to show due diligence in regard to her ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The DHS conceded that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that she did not have jurisdiction as found in her decision because the motion to reopen had already been granted.
 
On August 23, 2007, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider noting the DHS’s concession but finding that she had no jurisdiction under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) because the respondent departed the United States prior to the hearing on her motion which bad already been granted. The Immigration Judge also found that, while the respondent substantially complied with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), she did not show due diligence in pursuing her claim. On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in applying 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) to her case because she was not under a final order of removal at the time she departed. In opposition, the DHS contends that her motion is untimely and also alleges that the respondent has another outstanding order of removal entered against her in absentia and was required to surrender for deportation on February 14, 2002, but did not. According to the DHS, the respondent is in separate proceedings under a different alien number because she reentered the United States in 2001 under a false name.
 
Initially, we find that the Immigration Judge misapplied 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) to the respondent’s case to find that she did not have jurisdiction. The record reflects that the respondent was inside the United States when her attorney filed the motion to reopen on her behalf on September 26, 1996; she did not depart until February 11, 1997, just 2 days prior to her scheduled February 13, 1997, initial hearing date. Thus, the filing bar in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) is not applicable to the respondent’s case.
 
*3 However, we agree that the respondent has failed to establish her burden for reopening and rescission and further find that she has failed to sustain her burden of proof in establishing her ineffective assistance of counsel claim. As previously discussed, the respondent did not file her motion until 10 years after the in absentia order was entered against her. In this regard, she now claims that her motion should be granted because her former attorney, who represented her during her motion, failed to notify her of the hearing date and, on this basis, asserts that she has been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. As we understand the respondent’s contentions, she argues both a lack of notice and that any applicable filing deadline for her motion should be excused because she has been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent predicates her lack of notice argument upon her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and, thus, these arguments in this case are inextricably intertwined.
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, has determined that the deadline for motions to reopen deportation proceedings may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000). In order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in this way, an alien must demonstrate not only that her constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that she has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case. Id. Here, we find that the long delay in filing the motion to reopen is not reasonably explained by the circumstances of this case. The evidence of record indicates that the respondent hired counsel to file her motion to reopen. Contra, respondent’s July 19, 2007 declaration in support of motion to reconsider, (¶ 13), claiming she was never told her case had been reopened, only that her attorney did not thereafter notify her of the bearing date. In this regard, the respondent has failed to provide any reasonable basis as to why, during a 10-year span, she did not contact her counsel to find out when a hearing had been scheduled or why she waited 10 years to learn of the outcome of those proceedings. In this regard, the respondent’s claim that she was not notified of the hearing date is not reasonable inasmuch as she was aware that her motion was granted and failed to take any action for 10 years.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jon Eric Garde, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Leslie E. Smith Turner
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on August 22, 2006, when we affirmed an Immigration Judge’s April 8, 2005, decision denying the respondent’s motion to continue the proceedings pending the adjudication of a visa petition filed on her behalf. The Immigration Judge denied the motion as a matter of discretion based, in part, on her finding that the respondent attempted to conceal the fact that she had participated in fraud to procure a visa to enter the United States. See I.J. at 12-13. See also Onyeme v. U.S. I.N.S., 146 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir. 1998) (whether to grant a motion to continue deportation proceedings is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. On July 2, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit declared that the Immigration Judge’s refusal to grant the continuance was not an abuse of discretion, and denied the respondent’s petition for review of our decision. Flores v. Gonzales, 231 Fed.Appx. 283 (4th Cir. 2007) (unpublished). The respondent’s now moves to reopen our August 22, 2006, decision based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c). See also Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Although the Board has no record of receiving the motion prior to October 9, 2007, the respondent’s attorney asserts that the motion was timely filed on August 20, 2006, and he has submitted documentation in support thereof. We will deem the motion to have been timely filed. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent attempted to conceal pertinent facts was based on an adverse credibility determination. The respondent now reiterates her appellate arguments that she was confused during the removal hearings, and that she did not knowingly participate in fraud in procuring a visa. The Board rejected these arguments when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision, and we will not revisit them at this time. See INS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450 U.S. 139, 141 (1981) (discussing motions to reopen). The respondent further attempts to blame her former attorney for allegedly failing to prepare her adequately to testify at the removal hearings. It is not alleged by the respondent, and there is no basis to determine, however, that her former attorney advised her to conceal facts from the Immigration Judge. We emphasize that the respondent was placed under oath and that she swore to tell the truth during the removal hearings. See Tr. at 12. The respondent’s current explanations to account for the attempted concealment of facts fail to overcome her obligation to testify truthfully during the removal hearings. We reject the respondent’s efforts to shift the blame for her own actions to her former attorney. Indeed, we find no prejudicial error on the part of the respondent’s former attorney. See Figeroa v. INS, 886 F.2d 76 (4th Cir. 1989) (To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at a deportation proceeding, an alien must show not only ineffective representation, but also prejudice to him which occurred as a result of that ineffectiveness). The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied. The request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Victoria Calle, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mark J. Wurtz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on June 29, 1999, because he failed to appear for his hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on August 15, 2007, but the Immigration Judge denied it on September 13, 2007. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues On appeal that he was not adequately notified of the hearing. The record reflects that the Notice of Hearing was mailed to the respondent’s former counsel, Bernard Rosenbloom. A copy was also mailed to the respondent at his last known address, 527 Madison Avenue, No. 2, Elizabeth, NJ 07201. The respondent denies having received the hearing notice from either the Immigration Court or his counsel. A Notice of Hearing sent to an alien’s attorney of record is proper notice. See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) and Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (1985). We further consider that the hearing notice was sent to an address provided on the Form I-830 and stated on counsel’s motion to withdraw filed on May 18, 1999. There is also no indication that the post office returned the notice as undeliverable. The respondent has further not denied the correctness of the address and has not alleged that he was not residing at that location when the notice was mailed. He also does not allege any problems with mail delivery at his home. In addition, the respondent was aware that he was in removal proceedings and apparently made no attempt to verify his immigration status until 2003. His reliance on the instruction of another alien that it often takes years to obtain a hearing date is not a valid excuse for failing to do so.
 
We have considered the totality of the evidence presented, and we cannot find based on the respondent’s denial of receipt that he has rebuted the presumption of delivery of the hearing notice. Maknojiya v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 588, 589 (5th Cir.2005) (noting the lower burden required for rebutting the presumption of delivery for correspondence sent by regular mail was met where both alien and his counsel submitted affidavits indicating that they did not receive the notice that reset the hearing from an earlier hearing date than originally scheduled). The notice provided in these proceedings was therefore adequate because it was received by former counsel and mailed to the respondent at his correct address. This aspect of the Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
The respondent further argues that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and therefore exceptional circumstances prevented his appearance for his hearing. He indicates in his affidavit that former counsel Bernard Rosenbloom did not notify him of his hearing, and told him that venue in these proceedings would be changed to New Jersey. He further indicates that Mr. Rosenbloom instructed him to wait for his next hearing date, and presumably did not inform the respondent that he had withdrawn as his representative. The respondent further indicates that he did not know until September 2003 that he was ordered removed from the United States in absentia. He also indicates that a second attorney negligently delayed his submission of his motion to reopen.
 
*2 A request for rescission of an order of removal based on “exceptional circumstances” must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). Even if we equitably tolled the 180-day period for seeking reopening, we cannot find that the respondent satisfied the procedural requirements for establishing attorney negligence. See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383 (5th Cir. 2001); Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The record reflects that a complaint has been filed against Mr. Rosenbloom with a Texas disciplinary authority. However, there was no showing that Mr. Rosenbloom was notified of the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel raised herein and allowed an opportunity to respond. We cannot find based solely on the respondent’s accounts that he was the victim of attorney negligence without a showing that his attorney was given an opportunity to provide his rendition of the facts. The respondent has therefore failed to establish that he was the victim of attorney negligence, and we cannot find that exceptional circumstances prevented his appearance for the hearing. We therefore need not address whether the respondent’s second attorney negligently delayed the submission of the motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
