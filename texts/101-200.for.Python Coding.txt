IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Wael M. Ahmad, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lynn Hollander
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s January 30, 2017, decision denying her motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on March 26, 2013, after she did not appear for a scheduled hearing. She filed her motion to reopen on January 23, 2017. The Department of Homeland Security has submitted a brief in opposition to the respondent’s appeal, which will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded only if the alien files a motion to reopen: (1) within 180 days after the date of the removal order in which he establishes that the failure to appear was because of “exceptional circumstances,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(e)(1); or (2) at any time where the alien establishes that she did not have proper notice of the hearing at which the removal order was entered. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen because the record does not support the respondent’s argument that she did not receive proper notice of her hearing. The hearing notice was served on the respondent’s attorney of record, who was present at the March 26, 2013, hearing. Service on the respondent’s attorney of record constitutes proper service of a hearing notice. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c)(2), 1292.5(a); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985). The respondent asserts in her motion to reopen that her attorney failed to apprise her of the hearing at which she was ordered removed. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2, 4. However, the respondent’s attorney stated at the March 26, 2013, hearing that he had attempted to contact the respondent and had been unable to contact her (IJ at 1). Further, to the extent that the respondent asserts that she did not receive notice of the hearing because of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has not complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing such a claim. See Lin Xing Jiang v. Holder, 639 F.3d 751, 753 (7th Cir. 2011) (approving of the Matter of Lozada requirements). While the respondent states on appeal that she intends to demonstrate compliance with some of the Lozada requirements,1 no additional evidence has been submitted. We conclude that the respondent has not established that proceedings should be reopened due to improper notice.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We note that submitting a bar complaint, as the respondent suggests she intends to do, is not sufficient by itself to satisfy the Lozada requirement that the accused attorney be given a timely opportunity to respond. Marinov v. Holder, 687 F.3d 365, 369 (7th Cir. 2012).

IN RE: SORIE BARRIE
File: AXXX XX1 469 - Atlanta, GA
September 26, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tiana P. Garner, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Sierra Leone, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated May 4, 2017, denying his request for a continuance and ordering his removal from the United States. The Department of Homeland Security has not filed an appellate brief or statement. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent does not contest on appeal the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that he is subject to removal from the United States under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (2017), as an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(G) and (R) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(G) and (R) (IJ at 2; Exh. 1). The respondent also does not challenge the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that he is not eligible at this time for any form of relief available in these proceedings. (IJ at 2). Those issues are not before us.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s speculative pursuit of post-conviction relief in the state jurisdiction where he was convicted of removable criminal offenses did not amount to good cause warranting a further continuance of proceedings (IJ at 2). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. On the date of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent did not assert that he had even begun the process of applying for post-conviction relief (Tr. at 6-8). In the respondent’s appellate brief, while he does state that his convictions are “in the process of being re-opened,” he does not specifically claim to have filed any specific motion for post-conviction relief with any court. See Respondent’s Br. at 2. In any event, even if the respondent had filed a proper motion in state court seeking relief from the conviction, the respondent’s conviction would remain final for immigration purposes. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). While we acknowledge that the respondent may intend to seek, or continue to seek collateral relief, his arguments on appeal do not persuade this Board that his quest for collateral relief is more than speculative.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent makes a claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel in immigration proceedings. We note that the respondent has not shown that he was substantially prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his request for a continuance in order to further challenge his criminal convictions. See Cole v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 712 F.3d 517, 534-35 (11th Cir. 2013); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356 (BIA 1983). Since the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent has not presented any evidence that his convictions were vacated or that he has filed for post-conviction relief.1 For that reason, and because the collateral challenge remains speculative, the respondent’s assertion that former counsel failed to adequately present a case for a continuance is not a basis for a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. As this Board noted in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d sub nom. Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), a showing of some level of prejudice is a requirement for a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Id. at 638. Finally, the respondent has not articulated on appeal any form of relief for which he is eligible, and therefore his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be based on an assertion that former counsel improperly failed to apply for relief.2
 
If the respondent believes that he should be permitted to remain in the United States while he further challenges his criminal convictions, he is not precluded from pursuing immigration benefits, such as a stay of removal, directly from the DHS. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.6. However, as we decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to order his removal from the United States, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Statements of counsel made on appeal are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505-06 (BIA 1980). Furthermore, the copy of the plea colloquy in the respondent’s criminal case that has been submitted in conjunction with this appeal is not, without more, evidence of an ongoing collateral challenge to the convictions.

2

The respondent’s appellate argument that this appeal should be sustained based on the ineffective assistance of counsel in the respondent’s criminal proceedings is unavailing. The proper forum for that claim is with the state court having jurisdiction over the respondent’s claim.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dalia R. Kejbou, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jason Ritter
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Iraq, appeals the Immigration Judge’s November 21, 2016, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the Immigration Judge’s factual findings for clear error, including findings as to the credibility of testimony. We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
The respondent was admitted to the United States on June 18, 1970, as a lawful permanent resident (IJ at 1; Exh. 1). On February 5, 1991, the respondent was convicted of conspiracy for the “Unlawful manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver . . .” cocaine in the amount of 650 grams or more, in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws. § 333.7401(2)(a)(1), and was sentenced to life in prison without parole (IJ at 1-2). See February 5, 1991, Judgment.1 The respondent was released from custody after serving 19 years in prison (IJ at 2). The respondent was placed in removal proceedings and charged with being removable based on his conviction for an aggravated felony and a controlled substance violation. See sections 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act; see also Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. 184 (2013). On May 1, 2009, the respondent signed a Stipulated Request for Removal Order and Waiver of Hearing in which he said that he had no fear of returning to Iraq (IJ at 2). See Stipulated Removal Request at 2; see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.25(b). The Department of Homeland Security concurred in the respondent’s request for a stipulated removal order.
 
In the Biographic Information form that the respondent completed, however, he indicated that he was afraid “of being harmed and persecuted if returned to Iraq” (IJ at 2). See May 6, 2009, Biographic Information at 2. Because of the inconsistency in the respondent’s statements about his fear of returning to Iraq, the Immigration Judge denied the joint request for a stipulated order of removal and scheduled a master calendar hearing (IJ at 2). See Immigration Judge’s May 14, 2009, Order.
 
At the respondent’s May 18, 2009, hearing, the Immigration Judge informed the respondent that, because of his conviction, he was only eligible to apply for relief under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 3; Tr. at 2-3). The respondent said that he understood (IJ at 3; Tr. at 3, 4). The respondent declined the Immigration Judge’s offer to reschedule the hearing so that the respondent could speak to his family and potentially obtain counsel (IJ at 3; Tr. at 4). The respondent indicated that he had been in jail for 19 years because of his criminal conviction and that he continued to be detained on an “““immigration hold” (Tr. at 2). The respondent stated that, although he had a fear of returning to Iraq, he did not want to seek relief from removal because he did not want to be detained any longer (Tr. at 1-2, 3-4). The respondent said that he did not “want to get deported, but like I told you, I just want to get out of jail. And if that’s what it takes, to deport me, then that’s your decision, sir.” (IJ at 3; Tr. at 4). The respondent indicated that he understood that he was waiving his right to apply for relief and that he would be ordered removed (Tr. at 4-5). After questioning the respondent about whether he understood his rights, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s request for the entry of a removal order and the respondent waived his right to appeal (IJ at 3; Tr. at 4-5).
 
*2 Seven years later, on October 7, 2016, the respondent filed a Motion to Reopen his removal proceedings. In the motion, the respondent argued that his stipulated removal request was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. The respondent asked that his proceedings be reopened so that he could apply for withholding of removal and relief under section 212(c) of the Act. On November 21, 2016, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent now appeals that decision.
 
“A motion to reopen [or remand] proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). In addition, to obtain reopening, the respondent must make a prima facie showing that he is statutorily eligible for the relief sought and that he warrants relief in the exercise of discretion. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 106 (1988). Prima facie eligibility is shown where the evidence reveals a reasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied and that there is a reasonable likelihood that relief will be granted in the exercise of discretion. See Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 419 (BIA 1996).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that his “consent to the joint stipulated request was not knowing, voluntary, considered and intelligent.” See Respondent’s Brief at 1. Contrary to the respondent’s argument, however, the Immigration Judge did not accept the parties’ stipulated removal order. See Immigration Judge’s May 14, 2009, Order. Because the respondent indicated in the Biographic Information that he feared persecution in Iraq, the Immigration Judge held a master calendar hearing and informed the respondent of his rights including to have a hearing and to seek counsel (IJ at 2; Tr. at 1, 2). The Immigration Judge informed the respondent that, because of his conviction, he was only eligible to apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 3; Tr. at 2-3). As noted above, the respondent indicated that he had been in jail for 19 years because of his criminal conviction and that he continued to be detained on an “immigration hold” (Tr. at 2). The respondent stated that he did not want to seek relief from removal because he did not want to be detained any longer. The respondent said that he did not “want to get deported, but like I told you, I just want to get out of jail. And if that’s what it takes, to deport me, then that’s your decision, sir.” (IJ at 3; Tr. at 4). The respondent also said that he understood that he was waiving his right to apply for relief and that he would be ordered removed. After questioning the respondent about whether he understood his rights, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s request for the entry of a removal order (Tr. at 5). Therefore, contrary to the respondent’s argument on appeal, the Immigration Judge did not order the respondent removed pursuant to the stipulated removal order.2
 
*3 In any event, even if the respondent’s waiver was not knowing and voluntary, the respondent sought reopening in order to apply for withholding of removal and relief under section 212(c) of the Act. Motion to Reopen at 3, 5. Nonetheless, he did not present sufficient evidence to show that he was prima facie eligible for such relief. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. at 323; see also Mapouya v. Gonzales, 487 F.3d 396, 415-16 (6th Cir. 2007) (due process claim cannot succeed without a showing that the alleged error materially affected the outcome of his case). As the Immigration Judge found, because the respondent’s conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver 650 grams or more of cocaine constitutes a particularly serious crime, the respondent is statutorily ineligible for withholding of removal (IJ at 12). See section 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Y-L-, 23 I&N Dec. 270, 274 (A.G. 2002) (convictions for drug trafficking crimes are presumptively convictions for particularly serious crimes under the Act unless the respondent demonstrates “the most extenuating circumstances that are both extraordinary and compelling”); Matter of N-A-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 336, 343 (BIA 2007).3
 
Further, the respondent does not meaningfully challenge on appeal the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent is ineligible for section 212(c) relief because the respondent served 19 years in prison for his aggravated felony conviction (IJ at 11). Matter of Abdelghany, 26 I&N Dec. 254, 272 (BIA 2014) (alien is ineligible for relief under section 212(c) if, inter alia, he has served an aggregate term of imprisonment of at least 5 years as a result of one or more aggravated felony convictions entered between November 29, 1990, and April 24, 1996); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(f)(4)(i); Respondent’s Brief at 1-2.
 
In addition, the respondent has not made a prima facie showing that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured in Iraq by or with the acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity (IJ at 12-13; Tr. at 3). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c) and 1208.18(a). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not present sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the government of Iraq would acquiesce in the respondent’s torture and the respondent has identified no clear error in that finding (IJ at 12).
 
In sum, given the evidence presented, we uphold the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. at 323 (to obtain reopening, the respondent must make a prima facie showing that he is statutorily eligible for the relief sought and that he warrants relief in the exercise of discretion).
 
*4 Further, while this appeal was pending, the respondent filed a second Motion to Reopen and for Stay of Removal. Under section 207(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, with limited exceptions, the respondent may file one motion to reopen and it must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). The respondent’s second motion was filed more than 8 years after he was ordered removed, however. Nonetheless, the time and numerical limitations do not apply if the respondent seeks to apply for asylum based on changed country conditions arising in his country of nationality and submits material evidence that was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4); see also Matter of C-W-L-, 24 I&N Dec. 346, 349 (BIA 2007).
 
In this case, to demonstrate changed country conditions in Iraq, the respondent relies on news articles indicating that former Secretary of State John Kerry stated in 2014 that actions by ISIS in Iraq constitute genocide against certain minority groups including Christians. See Second Motion to Reopen at 6. Based on these statements, the respondent argues that conditions in Iraq have changed for Christians and, therefore, that he warrants an exception to the time and numerical limitations on the filing of a motion to reopen.
 
Despite this argument, however, the respondent also relied on these news articles when he filed his first Motion to Reopen on October 7, 2016. See First Motion to Reopen at 5. In that motion, the respondent stated that, on March 17, 2016, the “United States government declared that ISIS’s current actions against Christians in Iraq rise to the level of genocide. John Kerry, Sec’y of State.” First Motion to Reopen at 5. The respondent’s second motion to reopen also argues that, based on Secretary Kerry’s statement, the respondent’s removal proceedings should be reopened.
 
Similarly, although the respondent argues that a federal district court judge recently granted a preliminary injunction against the removal of Iraqi nationals from the United States, the respondent’s argument that he fears persecution in Iraq because he is a Christian is substantively the same argument that he made in his first Motion to Reopen. See Second Motion to Reopen at 7, Exh. F.
 
Given the evidence presented, the respondent has not presented material evidence that was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. See Bi Feng Liu v. Holder, 560 F.3d 485, 491 (6th Cir. 2009). For these reasons, we conclude that the respondent has not shown that he qualifies for an exception to the time and numerical limits on the filing of a motion to reopen in order to apply for asylum or withholding of removal.
 
*5 To the extent that the respondent argues that his proceedings should be reopened because his prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance, the respondent did not comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). To succeed on a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent should submit an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts including the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken on appeal. Also, the former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed respond. Finally, the motion should reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639. The respondent must also show that he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857, 863-64 (6th Cir. 2006).
 
In this case, the respondent has not submitted an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts including the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken on appeal, and has not indicated whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not. The respondent also has not shown that he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, because the respondent did not comply with the requirements for filing a motion to reopen to allege ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
Finally, to the extent that the respondent requests a stay of removal pending his appeal, because we dismiss the respondent’s appeal, the request for a stay of removal is moot. To the extent that the respondent argues that his removal should be stayed so that he can apply for relief from removal, the respondent’s request will be construed as a request for reopening and is denied as explained above. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

At the time of the respondent’s conviction, the statute under which the respondent was convicted provided: “Sec. 7401. (1) Except as authorized by this article, a person shall not manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled substance . . . . (2) A person who violates this section as to: (a) A controlled substance classified in schedule 1 or 2 which is either a narcotic drug or described in section 7214(a)(iv) and: (i) Which is in an amount of 650 grams or more of any mixture containing that controlled substance is guilty of a felony and shall be imprisoned for life.” Mich. Comp. Laws § 333.7401.

The respondent argues that he would have “done anything to get out of custody after serving more than 19 years in prison.” See Respondent’s Brief at 1. This does not demonstrate, however, that the respondent’s acceptance of a removal order was not knowing and voluntary. See Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742 (1970). In fact, the respondent concedes that the Immigration Judge advised the respondent of his rights and that “it appears from the record that Respondent may have understood the Immigration Judge[’s] questions.” See Respondent’s Brief at 1.

The respondent has not challenged the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent is removable as charged or that his conviction constitutes a particularly serious crime (Tr. at 3-4). See Respondent’s Brief at 1-2.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Celestine Tatung, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cori White
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 At a hearing held on February 14, 2017, the respondent did not apply for any form of relief and the Immigration Judge ordered her removal to El Salvador. The respondent timely filed a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, asserting that her prior counsel should have pursued an application for asylum and a petition for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status on her behalf. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on April 7, 2017; the respondent’s appeal from that decision will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen, for the reasons set forth in his decision. Even assuming that the respondent complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), she did not establish that her former counsel’s representation was ineffective. The respondent has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for the relief she contends her former counsel should have sought. The respondent asserts that she entered as an unaccompanied minor and her former counsel should have filed a petition for Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status (Form I-360) on her behalf. However, the record reflects that the respondent entered the United States at age 19; thus, she did not qualify as an unaccompanied minor, and has not demonstrated that she could have obtained SIJ status.
 
Furthermore, the respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. She does not indicate in her motion or on her asylum application1 that she has suffered persecution or fears future persecution on account of an enumerated ground contained in the Act. See Matter of S-P-, 21 I&N Dec. 486 (BIA 1996); sections 208(b)(1)(B)(i) and 241(b)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(1)(B)(i), 1231(b)(3)(A). A generalized fear of gang violence does not support a claim for asylum. See Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 235 (BIA 2014) (“asylum and refugee laws do not protect people from general conditions of strife, such as crime and other societal afflictions”); see also Quinteros-Mendoza v. Holder, 556 F.3d 159, 164 (4th Cir. 2009). In light of the foregoing, we find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance on the part of her former attorney. Thus, she did not demonstrate that reopening is warranted.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jaspreet Singh, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jo Ann McLane
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 31, 2017, denying his motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on December 8, 2011. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), filed a motion for summary affirmance and argued in opposition to the appeal. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed (i) within 180 days after the date of the removal order if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (ii) at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 722-23 (BIA 1999).
 
In this case, the respondent was properly served a Notice to Appear in person on February 7, 2011, while he was in DHS custody at the Willacy Detention Center. While the respondent was detained, an attorney filed a Notice of Entry of Attorney or Representative, Form EOIR-28, on February 11, 2011. The Form EOIR-28 provided the address for the respondent’s attorney of record. On March 8, 2011, the Immigration Court sent a notice of hearing to the address provided by the respondent’s attorney of record (EOIR-28, dated February 11, 2011). The notice of hearing informed the respondent that a hearing was scheduled for December 8, 2011. The notice of hearing was not returned to the Immigration Court as undeliverable.
 
The respondent failed to appear and he was ordered removed in absentia December 8, 2011. If an alien fails to provide an address pursuant to section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act, then “no notice shall be required.” Section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Act. See Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d 354, 359-60 (5th Cir. 2009) (court found that alien did not receive notice of his hearing because he failed to comply with his obligation to provide the Immigration Court with current address information).
 
*2 We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the respondent is properly charged with receipt of the February 11, 2011, notice of the hearing, which scheduled a hearing for December 8, 2011 (IJ at 2). In his motion to reopen, the respondent argues that he filed an Alien Change of Address form, EOIR-33, dated March 8, 2011, and did not receive notice of his hearing held on December 8, 2011 (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2-5). Assuming that the change of address form was filed on March 8, 2011, we note that the change of address was filed after the February 11, 2011, notice of hearing was sent to the attorney of record. Service of the notice of hearing to the attorney of record constitutes adequate notice of the hearing scheduled for December 8, 2011. C.F.R. §§ 1003.13 (defining “Service”), 1295.5(a) (stating that whenever a person is required to be given notice, such notice shall be required to be served upon the attorney or representative or the person if himself if not represented). Moreover, we conclude that the respondent’s motion did not succeed in rebutting the presumption of delivery of the hearing notice in his case. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674 (BIA 2008). Therefore, the respondent received proper notice of the scheduled hearing.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen filed on May 1, 2017, included an application for asylum (Motion Reopen at 10-20). With certain exceptions, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on December 8, 2011. Thus, the motion to reopen was untimely by several years. However, the time limits for motions to reopen do not apply if the basis of the motion is to apply or reapply for asylum and for withholding of removal based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
In this case, the exception did not apply to the respondent’s motion, for it did not establish changed country conditions in India arising after the issuance of the Immigration Judge’s decision on December 8, 2011 (IJ at 2). Gotora v. Holder, 567 Fed.Appx. 219 (5th Cir. 2014) (“In determining whether evidence accompanying a motion to reopen demonstrates a material change in country conditions, the BIA ‘compare[s] the evidence of country conditions submitted with the motion to those that existed at the time of the merits hearing below.”DD’). The respondent’s motion to reopen included an application for asylum and for withholding of removal but did not present any evidence or arguments to establish that “changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality,” occurring after his hearing in December 2011 show that material changed circumstances or country conditions in India (IJ at 2). Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247, 252 (BIA 2007), aff’d., Shao v. Mukasey, 546 F.3d 138, 171 (2d Cir. 2008). Therefore, the respondent’s motion for reopening for the purpose of applying for asylum and for withholding of removal was properly denied.
 
*3 The respondent claims that his prior counsel did not inform him of the hearing in 2011. However, the respondent has not demonstrated a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the instant motion. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the Board). The respondent has not complied with any of Lozada’s procedural requirements. See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 498 (5th Cir. 2000) (finding that “the general application of the Lozada rules is not an abuse of discretion.”); Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gautam J. Jagannath, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ricardo Cuellar
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATIONS: Reopening; change of venue
 
*1 This case was last before us on October 20, 2000, when we entered a final administrative order dismissing the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his prior motion to reopen. On April 26, 2017, the respondent submitted the instant motion to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion. The motion exceeds both the time and number limitations for motions to reopen, and it will be denied. The respondent’s request for a change of venue will also be denied.
 
An alien may file only one motion to reopen and, with certain exceptions, it shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); section 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i). In certain circumstances, an alien may toll the time limit applicable to his motion to reopen by demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In addition to complying with the procedural requirements for such a claim, the alien must show prejudice as a result of the ineffective assistance and that he exercised due diligence during the period he seeks to toll. See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-498 (5th Cir. 2000); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of El Salvador. On February 4, 1999, he failed to appear for his removal hearing and he was ordered to be removed in proceedings conducted in absentia. On March 30, 1999, he sought to have his proceedings reopened based on a claim that he did not receive proper notice of his hearing. He now seeks reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent relates that he asked the advice of his mother’s attorney, who advised him not to attend his hearing because it was likely that he would be deported. See Motion, ¶ 6; Exhibit 3, ¶¶ 11, 15, 38. He states that the attorney advised him that despite a deportation order, he would be protected by his Temporary Protected Status (TPS). See Motion, ¶ 7; Exhibit 3, ¶ 18. The respondent claims that he did not become aware until 2006 that he had been ordered in 1999 to be removed, and did not understand how serious it was until 2016. See Motion, ¶ 8; Exhibit 3, ¶ 20. The respondent declares that he was unaware that a motion on his behalf had been filed in 1999, and that he found out in 2016, that the attorney who had previously advised him had filed a motion, a declaration, and an appeal on his behalf, but did not timely submit an appeal brief which resulted in the dismissal of the appeal. See Motion, ¶¶ 9-10, 12; Exhibit 3, ¶¶ 21-24. The respondent states that in 2001, he employed that attorney to help him in applying for TPS status on his own, and in 2003, employed him to help him apply for lawful permanent resident status. See Motion, ¶ 11; Exhibit 3, ¶¶ 25-30. He claims that his proceedings should be reopened based on the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Motion, ¶ 16; § III.
 
*2 The respondent also seeks reopening based on claims that his prior application for asylum was withdrawn without his apparent consent, that he is eligible for adjustment of status based on an approved visa petition filed on his behalf by his lawful permanent resident mother, that he is eligible for asylum based on past persecution that he suffered in El Salvador and a fear of persecution there as a member of two particular social groups, as a member of his mother’s family and as a person with tattoos, and that he is eligible for a nonimmigrant U visa petition as a victim of a crime in the United States. See Motion, § IV. However, these claims are not mentioned in the respondent’s affidavit, and statements of counsel are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980).
 
The respondent offers his affidavit, his prior motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge’s order denying his motion, the appeal briefing schedule, an extension request grant, our prior order dismissing his appeal, an approval notice for his application for employment authorization, an approval notice for a visa petition submitted on his behalf by his lawful permanent resident mother, a notice of administrative termination of an asylum application in his name but with a different alien registration number, his new application for asylum, an incident report from the Oakland Police Department, a letter to the attorney regarding his allegations of ineffective assistance, his complaint against him filed with the Executive Office of Immigration Review, and his current counsel’s declaration.
 
The respondent admits that he was aware of his hearing scheduled for February 4, 1999, and that he decided not to appear because he was advised by an attorney that he may be deported if he were to appear. We find that the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear.
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s claim at this time that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel because an attorney filed a motion to reopen, a declaration, and an appeal on his behalf in 1999 without his knowledge, and that he did not authorize that attorney to represent him or take such actions. The record reflects that on March 31, 1999, the respondent through counsel submitted a motion to reopen accompanied by a Form EOIR-26, Notice of Appearance as Attorney or Representative, signed by the respondent for representation before the Immigration Judge. The record further reflects that on July 9, 1999, the respondent through counsel submitted an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen accompanied by a Form EOIR-27, Notice of Appearance as Attorney or Representative, signed by the respondent for representation before this Board. We are not convinced that the respondent had not authorized the attorney to act on his behalf or to take those actions.
 
*3 We will deny the respondent’s motion because he has not established that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel and that he exercised due diligence in raising his claim against his former counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 637; Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. at 561; also Rodriguez-Manzano, 666 F.3d 948, 953 (5th Cir. 2012); Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2006) (upholding the Lozada requirements). The respondent states that he became aware in 2006 that he had been ordered to be removed based on his failure to appear for his hearing. We find that his claim that he did not understand the seriousness of the situation until 2016 is inadequate to explain his failure to seek reopening or to investigate the actions taken in his case, particularly in light of his history of employing the same attorney between 2001 and 2003. We conclude that equitable tolling of the time limit for a motion to reopen is not warranted in this case.
 
The burden of proof on a motion to reopen is on the alien to establish eligibility for the requested relief. See Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, 435 F.3d 547, 549 (5th Cir. 2006); Zhang v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 339, 344-45 (5th Cir. 2005). The evidence that the respondent offers is not sufficient to support his claim that he is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status, asylum, and a nonimmigrant U visa petition to warrant reopening his removal proceedings. His motion is not supported by applications for such relief other than an application for asylum. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (a motion to reopen must be accompanied by an appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation). Moreover, the respondent’s motion has not been timely filed, and a claim of eligibility for adjustment of status is generally not a circumstance warranting the grant of an untimely motion to reopen. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 105 (BIA 2009).
 
The respondent’s motion does not satisfy any of the exceptions to the time limit imposed on motions to reopen removal proceedings, and does not demonstrate an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). We conclude that the respondent has not satisfied his heavy burden of proving that his removal proceedings should be reopened. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). Accordingly, as the motion exceeds both the time and number limits for motions to reopen, it will be denied. The respondent’s request for a change of venue will also be denied.
 
*4 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen and request for a change of venue are denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rene Siqueiros, Esquire
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated February 3, 2017, denying the respondent’s request for a further continuance and granting him voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Initially, we note that the respondent has not submitted a brief in support of his appeal, despite indicating that he would submit a brief and despite requesting and being granted an extension for submission of a brief. Thus, we will consider only the limited statements presented in the respondent’s Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s request for a continuance. The decision to grant a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown, and that decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing. Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6.
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge continued these proceedings four times between April 2002 and February 2017, to provide the respondent opportunities to seek legal representation and for case preparation. At the February 3, 2017, hearing, the respondent appeared with prior counsel; however, he did not identify any relief from removal that he wished to pursue. Rather, the respondent’s prior counsel made a motion to withdraw from the respondent’s case, and further moved to substitute a different attorney to represent the respondent. The Immigration Judge denied those motions.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel by his prior attorney, and that such ineffective assistance prevented him from pursuing relief available to him. However, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) so as to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Nor has the respondent articulated on appeal any relief for which he may be eligible. Although the respondent asserted that he “may” be eligible for asylum because he was a police officer in Mexico, he has not submitted an application for asylum on appeal, or otherwise set forth a persecution claim. Accordingly, he has not established that any deficient assistance by prior counsel caused him any prejudice. See Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241 (9th Cir. 2000) (requiring a showing of prejudice to establish a violation of due process). Nor has he established that continued proceedings were warranted. The following orders will therefore be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alexander C. Vrbanoff, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Geoffrey P. Gilpin
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on April 18, 2012, at which time we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s March 17, 2011, denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen his in absentia proceedings. The respondent has now filed, on July 31, 2017, an untimely motion to reopen proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that we should reopen proceedings based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel that he received from the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Court and this Board. Specifically, the respondent argues that his attorney failed to properly request information from him about his mental state, and that as a result, he did not have an opportunity to present the true reasons for his absence from his February 16, 2011, hearing during his previous motion. In support of his current claim, the respondent has submitted, inter alia, medical records and a March 26, 2017, psychological assessment, as well as an affidavit, letters of support, and evidence indicating that he filed a complaint with the Illinois bar in compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Notwithstanding the respondent’s complaint with the Supreme Court of Illinois, Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission, he has failed to carry his burden of demonstrating that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel. The Illinois Disciplinary Commission concluded that they would be “““unable to establish by the requisite standard of evidence that (prior counsel) neglected your legal matter or that he otherwise engaged in professional misconduct.” Moreover, we note that the respondent’s letter to prior counsel, dated May 1, 2017, claims that in preparation for his initial 2011 motion to reopen, “the only questions you asked me were about why I had failed to appear at the hearing.” Under the circumstances, we do not find that the respondent has carried his burden of demonstrating that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel. Id.
 
Moreover, as the DHS argues in its response brief, the respondent has not brought this motion with due diligence. See El-Gazawy v. Holder, 690 F.3d 852, 859-60 (7th Cir. 2012). The respondent does not assert that he was unaware of the denial of his 2011 motion to reopen proceedings, and he has not demonstrated that he could not reasonably have filed this motion within the last 5 years. Id; see also Patel v. Gonzalez, 442 F.3d 1011 (7th Cir. 2006).
 
*2 Accordingly, we find no merit to the respondent’s motion, and no reason to except the respondent’s motion from the timeliness requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion will be, accordingly, denied as untimely.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William Chu, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Roslyn Gonzalez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand; reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent, a native of the United Arab Emirates and a citizen of India, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 20, 2016, ordering the respondent removed from the United States.1 The respondent has also filed a motion to remand.2 The Department of Homeland (DHS) opposes the appeal and the motion. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was placed in removal proceedings pursuant to a Notice to Appear (NTA) filed with the Immigration Court on April 21, 2014 (Exh. 1). At a hearing on May 14, 2015, the respondent, through counsel, admitted the first three allegations in the NTA but denied that he entered into a marriage with a United States citizen for the sole purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit (Tr. at 2). At that time, the respondent also denied the charge of removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A) (Tr. at 2-3). On May 27, 2016, the DHS filed a Form I-261, Additional Charges of Removability, charging the respondent under section 237(a)(3)(D) of the Act (Exh. 3).
 
At a hearing on June 20, 2016, the respondent admitted the previously denied allegation, admitted the allegations contained in the Form I-261, and conceded both charges of removability (Tr. at 8-11). The respondent’s counsel requested a continuance to prepare an application for cancellation of removal for certain nonpermanent residents under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1) (Tr. at 13-14). The DHS opposed the respondent’s request, arguing that the respondent is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal by virtue of having departed the United States for an aggregate period of more than 180 days (Tr. at 17-18). The DHS separately argued that the respondent was precluded from establishing that he has been a person of good moral character by virtue of his admissions and concessions (Tr. at 18). The respondent’s counsel indicated that the respondent was not seeking any other form of relief (Tr. at 24-25). The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States pursuant to the charges.
 
*2 As an initial matter, we recognize that the DHS, in its appeal brief, requested reconsideration of the Board’s February 2, 2017, decision exercising jurisdiction over the respondent’s appeal (DHS Br. at 3-4). However, this request is contained within the DHS’s appeal brief and is not a properly filed motion to reconsider. In any event, we would deny the motion as untimely as it was not filed within 30 days of our February 2, 2017, decision and the DHS has not adequately explained the delay in filing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2).
 
The respondent alleges ineffective assistance of former counsel and seeks a remand pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). He argues, inter alia, that his former counsel’s decision to concede the charges of removability constituted ineffective assistance. To support a claim for ineffective assistance, an alien must (1) provide an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts, including a statement of the terms of the attorney-client agreement; (2) inform prior counsel of the allegations and allow prior counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) file or explain why a grievance has not been filed with the disciplinary authorities against the offending attorney. Id. In addition to these requirements, an alien alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must also show that he or she was prejudiced by the actions or inactions of counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 640; Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada. The evidence offered in support of his motion includes an affidavit from the respondent, a copy of a letter sent to former counsel informing him of the allegations, and a copy of the grievance form that was filed with the State Bar of Texas.
 
Upon consideration of the evidence, we conclude that the respondent has established that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s ineffective assistance. In general, an alien will be bound by formal admissions and concessions made by counsel acting in his professional capacity. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (holding that the concession of deportability was a reasonable tactical decision by counsel). However, a concession by counsel may constitute ineffective assistance where there is no plausible explanation for how the strategy resulted in a possible tactical advantage. See Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 166 (5th Cir. 2006) (finding ineffective assistance where counsel conceded a false claim of citizenship charge, thereby cutting off all available avenues of relief, without any apparent benefit to the alien). We cannot agree with the DHS’s argument that respondent’s former counsel made a tactical decision to concede the charges to prevent the DHS from presenting witness testimony that would have negatively impacted the outcome of any discretionary form of relief, particularly where the respondent’s former counsel only requested one form of relief, which was unavailable to the respondent for other reasons (DHS Br. at 19).
 
*3 In light of the foregoing, we will grant the respondent’s motion to remand for a hearing on the charges of removability and any other proceedings the Immigration Judge deems appropriate.3 Because the record will be remanded, we do not address the respondent’s remaining arguments. In remanding, we express no opinion on the ultimate outcome of these proceedings. See Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996). The following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings and the issuance of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sanjay Chaubey, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Pakistan, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated March 13, 2017, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a response to the respondent’s appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
A motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days after entry of the final administrative decision sought to be reopened. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act. The respondent’s motion to reopen the proceedings more than 10 years after entry of the final order is untimely. The respondent has not shown that any exception to this filing deadline applies.1 See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4).
 
The respondent asserts ineffective assistance of prior counsel. However, the respondent did not comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). The order of removal indicates that the respondent did not file any application for relief. He has not made any specific allegations asserting that his failure to file an application for relief was due to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Sua sponte reopening is reserved for truly exceptional cases. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). “The power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship.” Id. at 984. The respondent has not shown circumstances that qualify as exceptional, and we therefore decline to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen this matter. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (holding that sua sponte authority should be invoked sparingly, “not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). Becoming potentially eligible for relief from removal after the entry of a final order is not, in and of itself, an exceptional circumstance that would justify sua sponte reopening of these proceedings.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We note that there is no indication in the Immigration Judge’s October 12, 2006, decision that it was issued after a hearing held in absentia. Moreover, even if it was, any related motion would be untimely unless there was a lack of proper notice. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). This was not alleged in the motion before the Immigration Judge, or otherwise established.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kyce Siddiqi, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Pakistan, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on February 19, 2016, after not appearing at a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on February 15, 2017, and appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 16, 2017, denying the motion. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that an “exceptional circumstance,” to wit, ineffective assistance of counsel prevented his appearance at the hearing. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) (stating that a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel must be filed within 180 days of the order of removal); Chen v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 267, 268 (2d Cir. 2006) (setting forth the requirements for equitable tolling); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel). According to the respondent, he received a Notice of Hearing, dated February 13, 2015, from the Immigration Court, which instructed him to appear on November 29, 2019. He states that he took the notice to his former counsel, and counsel did not instruct the respondent to notify the Immigration Court of any changes in his address. The respondent contends that counsel’s failure to notify him of his obligation to inform the Immigration Court of changes to his address resulted in the respondent not receiving notice for his February 19, 2016, hearing.
 
However, the February 13, 2015, Notice of Hearing informed the respondent of his obligation to update the Immigration Court with his most current address. In addition, according to former counsel’s February 14, 2017, letter to current counsel, he provided the respondent with a copy of the Notice to Appear on September 24, 2014, which advises the respondent of his obligation to report his current address to the Immigration Court. In light of the foregoing, the respondent has not established that the ineffective assistance of former counsel was the cause of his nonappearance at his hearing. It follows that we decline to equitably toll the 180-day period to file a motion to reopen based on “exceptional circumstances,” find the motion to be untimely filed, and we need not address whether the respondent satisfied the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raymond Lahoud, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeffrey T. Bubier
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent was granted voluntary departure on October 4, 2016. On December 28, 2016, this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that we did not have jurisdiction. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on January 3, 2017. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on January 11, 2017. The respondent filed an appeal of that decision with this Board on February 8, 2017. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent also filed a motion to terminate proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion denied.1
 
We have considered the arguments raised on appeal and find them unpersuasive. The respondent primarily argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge exhibited bias and prejudice throughout his proceedings. We reviewed the transcript and the Immigration Judge’s January 11, 2017, decision and find no evidence of bias or unfair treatment.
 
Moreover, we agree de novo with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (IJ at 1-2). Though the respondent complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, the respondent did not establish prejudice inasmuch as the respondent has not explained what, if any, relief is available to him that he was precluded from pursuing. The record indicates that the respondent’s prior counsel consulted with the respondent during his hearing and explained to the respondent his legal options (Tr. at 29). After their consultation, the respondent chose voluntary departure (Tr. at 28-20).
 
Inasmuch as the respondent has not established that his prior hearing was prejudiced due to ineffective assistance of counsel or bias, has not argued that he is eligible for any form of relief, and the transcript of the record reflects that the respondent knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal from the Immigration Judge’s October 4, 2016, decision, we will dismiss the appeal. Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
The respondent also filed a motion to terminate. The respondent alleges in his motion to terminate that he is no longer removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), because one of his convictions for theft by unlawful taking has been vacated. A conviction that has been vacated by the criminal court based upon a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings is no longer a conviction for immigration purposes. See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). The same is not true, however, if a conviction is vacated for rehabilitative reasons. The respondent’s counsel asserts on appeal that the respondent’s family “sought post-conviction relief counsel to address claims that the offenses . . . were constitutionally defective” (Respondent’s Brief at 3). The respondent, however, has not presented any evidence detailing the reasoning behind the criminal court’s decision to vacate his theft offense. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (“Counsel’s arguments are not evidence . . .”). As we are unable to determine the reasons that the respondent was granted post-conviction relief, we conclude that the respondent has not met his burden of proving that his conviction no longer remains for immigration purposes. Even if the respondent’s argument is correct and he is no longer removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, he remains removable under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), due to his controlled substance convictions.2 The respondent did not argue below or on appeal that he is not removable due his controlled substance convictions. Accordingly, we will deny the respondent’s motion to terminate.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and the motion denied.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Peru, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 16, 2017, which denied his motion to reopen removal proceedings. The parties have provided arguments on appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record shows that the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia on November 22, 2016, when he failed to appear for the hearing scheduled on that date (Exh. 3). The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen based on a claimed lack of notice of the hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
For the reasons provided in the decision, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. The respondent’s claimed lack of notice of the hearing is predicated on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, whom he asserts failed to communicate to the Immigration Court the respondent’s change of address. However, as the Immigration Judge found, the respondent did not substantially comply with the requirement of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (IJ at 3-4).
 
On appeal, the respondent has provided additional supporting evidence in addition to duplicate documents. Respondent’s Br., Exhs. 1, 7. However, our review is limited to the evidence of record before the Immigration Judge. Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984). Even if we were to construe the submission of new evidence as a motion to reopen and remand, we find that such action is not warranted here. The retainer agreement the respondent submitted is not signed by him or by the attorney in question, so it does not establish that the attorney was in fact representing the respondent in previous removal proceedings. Respondent’s Br., Exh. 1. In addition, despite his claims in the new affidavit, the respondent has not yet provided proof that the attorney has been advised of the complaint against him and been afforded the opportunity to respond. Respondent’s Br., Exh. 7. Thus, the additional evidence submitted on appeal does not warrant reopening the record and remanding for consideration by the Immigration Judge. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(1), 1003.23(b)(3). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eli A. Echols, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal as untimely on March 30, 2017. The respondent, who is a native and citizen of Brazil, filed an untimely motion to reconsider on May 8, 2017. Section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B)(2017); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2017). We will consider the late-filed motion to reconsider, based on the respondent’s motion to accept its late filing. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion to reconsider, which will be denied.
 
The motion to reconsider again seeks to have the Board consider the respondent’s untimely appeal. This is based again on a claim that prior counsel did not inform the respondent about the Immigration Judge’s decision, mailed on January 11, 2017, and of her right to appeal to the Board. The motion to reconsider now includes a May 4, 2017, statement from former counsel, concerning his failure to notify the respondent of the Immigration Judge’s January 11, 2017, decision. As at the time of our March 30, 2017, decision, however, the respondent has not met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent has also not shown that this case should be considered by the Board on certification. Matter of Liadov, 23 I&N Dec. 990 (BIA 2006) (Board has authority to consider a late appeal by certification under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c), under appropriate circumstances). The Immigration Judge’s January 11, 2017, decision denied a motion to reopen, which sought adjustment of status. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was ineligible for such relief under section 240B(d)(1)(B) of the Act, due to the fact that she overstayed a 2010 grant of voluntary departure. The respondent has set forth nothing to suggest why she would be found eligible for adjustment of status despite the strict bar to relief.
 
The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

IN RE: MARIA TERESA POLANCO- MONTERROSO
File: AXXX XX2 804 - Atlanta, GA
July 24, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Wayani J. Taylor, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joy Lampley
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In a decision dated May 27, 2016, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The respondent timely appeals from that decision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) seeks summary affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact by an Immigration Judge under the clearly erroneous standard of review, but we may review de novo questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge should have granted reopening. The respondent concedes that she received notice of her hearing when she was personally served with the Notice to Appear (NTA) in November 2005, but the respondent asserts that due to her youth, she did not understand her obligation to appear in court (Respondent’s Br. at 2-3, 6). Furthermore, the respondent claims that four months prior to her hearing, she filed a Form EOIR-33, apprising the court of her change of address, upon the advice of an immigration consultant.
 
An order of removal following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he or she did not receive proper notice of the time and place of the hearing, or because he or she was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of his or her own. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). A motion to reopen alleging lack of notice of the removal hearing, or that the respondent was in federal or state custody, may be filed at any time. However, a motion to reopen alleging exceptional circumstances, such as here, must be filed within 180 days after the entry of the removal order.
 
Upon review, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion to reopen alleging exceptional circumstances was filed beyond the 180 days allowed by statute. Thus, the motion was untimely. Even if timely-filed, the respondent’s motion does not establish the presence of exceptional circumstances to excuse her failure to appear at her hearing. Neither the respondent’s youth (she was 18 years old) nor ignorance about immigration proceedings would constitute an exceptional circumstance. Rather, it appears that the respondent believed that by filing a change of address, a new notice would be sent to her containing a new hearing date (Respondent’s Br. at 3-4, 6) (unnumbered).1
 
*2 We likewise find no merit to the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Exh. 5) (respondent’s affidavit fails to name the immigration consultant). See generally Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 514 F3d. 1224, 1226 (11th Cir. 2008) (stating but not explicitly holding that Lozada applies to claims of ineffective assistance rendered by non-attorneys). In claims asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, this Circuit requires a showing of prejudice which the respondent has not made in this case. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005) (agreeing with the Ninth Circuit that prejudice must be established). For all of these reasons, reopening was properly denied.
 
With regard to sua sponte reopening, we determine that sua sponte reopening is not merited as a matter of discretion. The facts in this case do not present an “exceptional situation,” particularly in consideration of the lack of due diligence by the respondent to clarify her immigration status in the past 9 years. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373 (A.G. 2002). In addition, while the respondent desires reopening in order to pursue adjustment of status based on her marriage to a United States citizen, the respondent does not appear statutorily eligible for relief due to the manner of her entry into the United States.2 See section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). Since the respondent was not physically present in the United States for at least one year prior to the issuance of the NTA, she also appears statutorily ineligible for the privilege of voluntary departure. See section 240B(b)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(1)(A).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent claims that her immigration consultant failed to advise her to file a motion to change venue with the change of address form (Form EOIR-33). While the respondent submitted a copy of a change of address form, the record does not contain the original form. In addition, even if the respondent filed a motion to change venue, the respondent would not be excused from appearing, as scheduled, until the motion was granted. See Immigration Court Practice Manual, Chapter 5: 5.10(c).

The respondent appears to want to proceed abroad for consular processing (Respondent’s Br. at 5) (unnumbered). She may be eligible to do so under the new rules for a provisional unlawful presence waiver under 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(3).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Wael M. Ahmad, Esquire
 
APPLICATIONS: Reopening; stay of removal
 
*1 This case was last before us on February 28, 2017, when we entered a final administrative order dismissing the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his second motion to reopen his in absentia removal proceedings. On April 5, 2017, the respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, submitted the instant motion to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2, based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. He requests a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The motion exceeds the number limitations for motions to reopen, and it will be denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(7)(A). The respondent’s stay request will also be denied.
 
The respondent contends that reopening sua sponte is warranted. He declares that his former counsel told him that he would request a change of venue and that he did not have to appear for his hearing. See Exhibit A, ¶¶ 4-5. The respondent states that he is aware that he could file a bar complaint against his former counsel but has not done so because his former counsel has already conceded that his representation was ineffective. Id, ¶ 9.
 
The respondent offers his affidavit and a printout of emails that purport to be between his current counsel and his former counsel. See Exhibits A and B. One of the emails indicates that his former counsel stated that a Lozada motion is appropriate at this time and that he will do a letter or sign an affidavit to help the respondent’s current counsel. See Exhibit B at 1. However, the respondent has not offered a letter or affidavit from his former counsel. The evidence is not adequate to demonstrate that the respondent’s former counsel conceded that his representation was ineffective. Further, the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that the respondent complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), as required by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in whose jurisdiction the instant case arises. See Lin Xing Jiang v. Holder, 639 F.3d 751, 754-55 (7th Cir. 2012) (the alien must satisfy the criteria set forth in Lozada to support a claim of ineffectiveness of counsel); Marinov v. Holder, 687 F.3d 365, 368-69 (7th Cir. 2012) (satisfying the Lozada requirements is a necessary condition to obtaining reopening on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
*2 The respondent has not met his heavy burden of proving that his removal proceedings should be reopened. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). We find that an exercise of our sua sponte authority to reopen is not warranted. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, as the respondent’s motion exceeds the number limitations for motions to reopen, it will be denied, and his request for a stay of removal will also be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen and request for a stay of removal are denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
P. Mercer Cauley, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Hilary Rainone
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 On January 13, 2017, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 17, 2016, decision.1 The Immigration Judge determined, inter alia, that the respondent is removable as an alien inadmissible at the time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1282(a)(6)(C)(i)(2016), for procuring a visa or other documentation, or admission through fraud or willful mirepresentation of a material fact (See Exh. 1B). See section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A) (2017). On February 13, 2017, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider with the Board, and on May 30, 2017, the respondent filed an amendment to the motion to reconsider. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); section 240(c)(6) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b) (2017). On April 12, 2017, the respondent filed a motion to reopen seeking adjustment of status. See section 240(C)(7) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes reopening and reconsideration, and the respondent has objected to the opposition by the DHS. The motions will be denied.
 
To the extent that the respondent contests the Immigration Judge’s findings and conclusions, we emphasize that a motion to reconsider is not an opportunity to raise issues that could have been raised on appeal, or to reiterate arguments previously considered and rejected on appeal. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); Matter of Guevara, 20 I&N Dec. 238 (BIA 1991). The respondent has offered no persuasive arguments to convince us that we erred in fact or law in our prior order. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. With the following comments, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s claim that she was not yet separated from her second husband in May 2010 lacked credibility, and determined that the respondent was removable under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act. The respondent now reiterates her argument that the Immigration Judge did not properly consider an order by the District Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, amending the date of her separation from her second husband from 2009 to 2011. As the Immigration Judge noted, however, the district court’s amended order was based entirely on the facts provided by the respondent. Further, the district court’s order was but one factor that the Immigration Judge considered in rendering his adverse credibility determination. In our prior decision, we found no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including his finding with regard to credibility of the respondent’s testimony. The respondent has put forth no new arguments or evidence that would now persuade us to alter our prior finding.
 
*2 The respondent further argues that she was denied due process because the Immigration Judge prevented her ex-husband from testifying at her removal hearing. The respondent, however, was provided with an opportunity to present witness testimony, including the testimony of her ex-husband. The record reveals that on February 3, 2015, the Immigration Judge continued the proceedings to a date convenient to the respondent, the DHS attorney, and the Immigration Judge to enable the respondent to present her ex-husband as a witness (Tr. at 50-58). At a continued hearing on March 2, 2015, however, the respondent appeared before the Immigration Judge without her ex-husband (Tr. at 58). Moreover, the respondent’s attorney did not request a further continuance at that time. We also note that in her appeal brief the respondent stated that despite great effort, she was unable to bring her ex-husband to the Immigration Court because “he was simply not being cooperative and refused to appear” (Respondent’s Appeal Br. at 4). Under the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the Immigration Judge to commence the respondent’s individual hearing. In sum, it has not been shown that the respondent’s ex-husband was prevented from testifying, and that the respondent suffered prejudice as a result.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen will also be denied. The respondent seeks reopening to enable her to apply for adjustment of status based on a pending visa petition that her husband, whom she married on September 30, 2015, filed on her behalf. The respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of an attorney who, she claims, advised her husband that he did not need to file a visa petition on her behalf. The respondent, however, has not complied with any of the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before this Board as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).2 See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741, 746 (4th Cir. 2006) (requiring that aliens raising ineffective assistance of counsel claims in immigration proceedings show at least substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements). Therefore, we will not consider the respondent’s allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel further.3
 
Moreover, it has been determined in these proceedings that the respondent, who was found to be inadmissible at the time of adjustment of status for seeking admission through fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact, does not merit a waiver of inadmissibility as a matter of discretion. The respondent has offered no new evidence with this motion to persuade us now that reopening for further consideration of possible discretionary relief is warranted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). See also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1988) (explaining that a party who seeks a remand or to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case).
 
*3 Accordingly, the respondent’s motions to reopen and reconsider will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: LORENZO CUETO-JIMENEZ
File: AXXX XX3 526 - Harlingen, TX
June 30, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed O. Gonzalez, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
On June 6, 2012, an Immigration Judge entered an in absentia order of removal against the respondent. On July 6, 2012, the respondent through counsel filed a motion to reopen to rescind his in absentia order of removal, which the Immigration Judge denied on August 31, 2012. The respondent did not appeal the denial of the motion.
 
On June 27, 2016, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a second motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. On July 21, 2016, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, now appeals. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings regarding witness credibility and what is likely to happen to the respondent, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review all other issues, including questions of law, discretion, and judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
In general, the Immigration and Nationality Act and the regulations provide that an alien may file one motion to reopen, and any such motion must be filed within 90 days of the entry of the final administrative order of removal. Section 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). The Act and regulations provide an exception to the general rule in the case of an alien who seeks to rescind an in absentia order of removal. An in absentia order of removal may be rescinded by a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances,1 or a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive notice in accordance with section 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act. See section 240(c)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
The Board and the Immigration Courts also have reopened cases filed more than 90 days after a final administrative order in which an alien proves that his claim was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel and when the motion was filed within a reasonable time after discovering the ineffective assistance. Our review of allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel is governed by our analysis in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). In Matter of Lozada, we stated that a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel requires that (1) the motion be supported by an affidavit of the applicant setting forth in detail the agreement between the applicant and her legal representative and what actions were to be taken on her behalf; (2) the counsel whose reputation is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) the motion reflect whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not.
 
*2 The regulations provide that a motion to reopen removal proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the respondent establishes prima facie eligibility for the underlying relief sought. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). An applicant demonstrates prima facie eligibility when the evidence reveals a reasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied. Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the July 27, 2016, motion to reopen because it was time-barred and number-barred. The motion was filed more than 4 years after the in absentia order of removal, and was the respondent’s second motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(A), (C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C).
 
The respondent claims that at the time of the in absentia order of removal he was eligible for adjustment of status based on his January 25, 2012, marriage to United States citizen Ms. Ocanas (Respondent’s Br. at 4, 10). Thus, he asserts that his prior attorney’s ineffectiveness in failing to notify him of his June 6, 2012, hearing prejudiced his ability to obtain relief in the form of adjustment of status. In support of this claim, he submitted on appeal his and Ms. Ocanas’ marriage certificate (Respondent’s Br. at 10, Attached Tab A).
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s arguments. First, the respondent did not sufficiently demonstrate that he did not receive notice of the June 6, 2012, hearing. The Immigration Judge properly concluded that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c)(2), 1292.5(a); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien). Although the respondent provided copies of returned mail from his prior attorney as evidence that she did not inform the respondent of the June 6, 2012, hearing, we have no way of knowing the contents of the returned mail, including whether the notice of the hearing was one of the returned mail items (Respondent’s Br. at 5-6, 13; Motion to Reopen at 5-6, 9, Attached Tab D).2
 
Second, the respondent did not show actual prejudice with respect to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Br. at 6-7, 12). The respondent did not provide any evidence of his marriage to Ms. Ocanas with the July 27, 2016, motion to reopen, and the record as of the filing of that motion did not reflect that the respondent was ever married to Ms. Ocanas (I.J. at 2).3 Rather, the record reflected only that the respondent divorced Ms. Chavez on September 1, 2011, and married Ms. Sanchez on November 16, 2015 (I.J. at 2; Motion to Reopen at 11, Tabs G, P).
 
*3 Also, the 2012 marriage to Ms. Ocanas alone did not establish prima facie evidence of eligibility for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act. The record does not contain evidence that Ms. Ocanas filed a Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative) on the respondent’s behalf such that he would have been eligible to receive an immigrant visa, or that the respondent otherwise had an immigrant visa immediately available to him at the time of the June 6, 2012, hearing (I.J. at 2). See section 245(a) of the Act. Thus, the respondent has not shown that any ineffectiveness by his prior attorney in not filing an adjustment of status application caused the respondent to suffer actual prejudice.
 
Finally, although the respondent did not appeal the Immigration Judge’s August 31, 2012, denial of the motion to reopen to rescind the in absentia order, the denial decision was correct. In the July 12, 2012, motion the respondent stated only that he was unable to attend the June 6, 2012, hearing because he was working off-shore. The Immigration Judge properly concluded that this did not constitute exceptional circumstances as contemplated by section 240(e)(1) of the Act. The respondent’s work schedule was not beyond his control, given that he had over 3 months to change his schedule or alert the Immigration Judge of the conflict and request a new hearing (I.J. dated August 31, 2012, at 1).
 
For these reasons we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the July 27, 2016, motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1), states that “‘exceptional circumstances’ refers to circumstances (such as battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien, serious illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.”

The Immigration Judge issued the June 6, 2012, decision after a hearing on February 1, 2012, which is 3 months before the earliest date stamped on the returned mail. Our review of the digital audio recording reflects that the respondent’s prior attorney was present at the February 1, 2012, hearing.

The respondent also did not provide any evidence of his marriage to Ms. Ocanas with his July 6, 2012, motion to reopen. As stated previously, that motion indicated only that the respondent was unable to attend the June 6, 2012, hearing because he was working off-shore.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Grace Ruth Kennedy, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Samuel “Alex” Brown
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 19, 2016, decision denying her motion to reopen her removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge issued a removal order on February 14, 2013, upon granting the DHS’ unopposed motion to pretermit the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). In her motion to reopen filed on August 8, 2016, the respondent asserted that it was unfair that the prior decision was rendered without a hearing; she points out she had previously appeared several times before the Immigration Judge. The respondent also emphasized her equities in this country that include her six United States citizen children, some of whom have medical issues. She also submitted proof that her United States citizen mother filed a visa petition on her behalf which was approved on March 28, 2016, and had a priority date of April 30, 2015 (Resp. Br. at 3; attachment F).
 
The Immigration Judge found the motion to reopen to be untimely, which the respondent has not contested (I.J. at 2). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (setting out a general 90-day filing deadline for motions to reopen). He further declined to sua sponte reopen her proceedings. The Immigration Judge recounted the history of the case, and inter alia, concluded that the respondent had ample opportunity to challenge the DHS’ motion to pretermit below. The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent did not exercise due diligence in that she waited over 3 years to file her motion after her removal, and more than one year after the visa petition was approved. He further noted that the motion was supported by attorney statements rather than an affidavit from the respondent.
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). Upon consideration of the factors addressed by the Immigration Judge, we agree that the respondent has not shown an “exceptional situation” exists that would warrant the Immigration Court’s or the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We therefore will not disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision in this regard.1
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent contends her due process rights were violated because the Immigration Judge denied her motion to reopen without providing a hearing on this matter (Resp. Br. at 2-3). As the respondent was afforded the opportunity to review the record and provide evidence and legal arguments in support of her motion to reopen, she was given a fundamentally fair proceeding (I.J. at 2). See Dukane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 2005). The respondent has not met her burden to demonstrate that she was deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the asserted errors caused her substantial prejudice by establishing that the outcome of this case would have been different but for the alleged error. Indrawati v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 779 F.3d 1284, 1299 (11th Cir. 2015).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge failed to consider the criteria for equitably tolling the filing deadline for her motion to reopen (Resp. Br. at 3-5). In connection with the Immigration Judge’s sua sponte authority to reopen her removal order, the Immigration Judge considered the respondent’s due diligence in filing her motion and whether some extraordinary circumstance stood in her way of a timely filing (I.J. at 2-3). See Ruiz-Turcios v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 717 F.3d 847, 851 (11th Cir. 2013). We do not disturb this determination. Moreover, the respondent has not identified any basis to toll the deadline due to ineffective assistance of counsel, or met the filing requirements for such a claim. See Ruiz-Turcios v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra; Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1221-23 (11th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). As the respondent has not presented any basis to disturb the decision of the Immigration Judge or reopen these proceedings, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Carlos Ramirez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; rescission
 
*1 On March 10, 2017, the Board dismissed the respondents’ appeal from the Immigration Judge’s October 20, 2016, decision denying their motion to reopen and rescind orders of removal entered in absentia on July 21, 2016. On April 6, 2017, the lead respondent, Juana Pascual Toledo Andres (AXXX XXX XXX), and her minor child, Angelina Marilu Cristobal Toledo (AXXX XXX XXX), filed the instant motion to reopen and rescind with the Board. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The motion will be denied.
 
An in absentia order of removal may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances or upon a motion filed at any time if she did not receive proper notice of the hearing or she was in Federal or States custody and failed to appear through no fault of her own. See section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. See section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
The record reflects that on March 25, 2016, the lead respondent (hereinafter referred to in the singular as “the respondent”) received oral and written notice of the hearing scheduled for July 21, 2016. In her motion to reopen and rescind before the Immigration Judge and on appeal, the respondent argued that she did not receive proper notice of an April 4, 2016, hearing. The Immigration Judge and the Board noted, however, that there was no hearing scheduled for that date in these proceedings.
 
In the instant motion, the respondent asserts that she did not appear at the July 21, 2016, hearing because the minor respondent was sick (Respondent’s Declaration). She further asserts that after she received the order of removal in the mail, she sought the assistance of an individual whom she believed to be an attorney to prepare and file the motion before the Immigration Judge (Respondent’s Declaration). She also claims that although she attempted to provide the nonattorney with a receipt for the child’s medication, he based the motion to reopen and rescind on a claim of improper notice (Respondent’s Declaration).
 
In her motion to reopen and rescind filed before the Board, the respondent raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against the nonattorney who allegedly prepared and filed the prior motion and appeal on her behalf.1 See Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237, 1240 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that equitable tolling is appropriate where the alien was “defrauded by an individual purporting to provide legal representation”); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (discussing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel before the Board). Specifically, she alleges ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of the nonattorney for failure to argue that her failure to appear was due to “exceptional circumstances” (Respondent’s Motion at 10).
 
*2 The 180-filing deadline imposed on motions to reopen and rescind may be equitably tolled based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2011). The alien, however, must establish, inter alia, that she suffered prejudice because of the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793 (9th Cir. 2005); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 562 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640. In the context of an ineffective assistance claim, prejudice results when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004).
 
The respondent has not established that she suffered prejudice due to ineffective assistance of counsel because, upon consideration of the totality of the circumstances, we find that she has not shown that exceptional circumstance prevented her from appearing at the July 21, 2016, hearing. The respondent claims that although “[she] knew that [she] needed to appear in court that morning,” she was concerned about the minor respondent’s health because the child was “very sick” with fever and vomiting (Respondent’s Declaration). The respondent has offered a receipt from a clinic in support of her claim (Motion Tab E). The document bears the name “Angelina Critobal.” It does not, however, reflect a diagnosis, prognosis, course of treatment, or any other information regarding the nature and seriousness of any illness. See Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, 298 F.3d 888 (9th Cir. 2002) (finding that the alien’s lack of evidence regarding the severity of his asthma attack restricted Board’s ability to determine if illness was exceptional); Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33 (BIA 1998) (holding that the lack of medical evidence or other evidence establishing, in detail, the seriousness of the alien’s illness is a factor to consider in determining if he or she has met the burden of proof for exceptional circumstances excusing a failure to appear). Further, the respondent, who knew of her obligation to appear at the scheduled hearing, has neither asserted nor offered any evidence that she attempted to inform the Immigration Court of absence or of the reasons for the absence. See Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, supra (finding that the Board’s consideration of the alien’s failure to notify the Immigration Court of the reason for his absence was not improper).
 
In sum, equitable tolling of the 180-day filing deadline imposed on motions to reopen and rescind based on the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not warranted where the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice as a result of the ineffective assistance of counsel. Further, we find that no other exception to the regulatory restrictions imposed on motions to reopen applies to this motion. We recognize that the respondent has offered an application for asylum and withholding of removal (Form I-589) with the instant motion. She has not, however, offered evidence regarding changed circumstances or conditions in her native country, Guatemala, since the scheduled hearing on July 21, 2016, to warrant reopening pursuant to section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act. See Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013) (holding that proceedings conducted in absentia may be reopened where the alien seeks asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Therefore, to the extent that the respondent seeks reopening to apply for asylum and withholding of removal, the instant motion will be denied as untimely and number-barred. See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
*3 For the foregoing reasons, the respondents’ motion to reopen the proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and rescind is denied.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joy Lampley
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: None
 
*1 The respondents, natives and citizens of El Salvador, have appealed from the Immigration Judge’s October 26, 2016, decision denying the lead respondent’s request for a continuance and ordering the respondents’ removal from the United States.1 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the appeal and motion for summary affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent does not challenge the Immigration Judge’s determination that she is removable as charged (Tr. at 6;Resp. Br. at 2). At the hearing, the respondent’s counsel indicated that the respondent applied prosecutorial discretion and no other applications for relief (Tr. at 7). The DHS stated that it declined to exercise prosecutorial discretion (Id.). As the respondent conceded that she was subject to removal and did not apply for any relief from removal, the Immigration Judge ordered her removed from the United States (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 8).
 
On appeal, the respondent, through new counsel, asserts that her prior counsel was ineffective in that she “unilaterally decided not to allow the [r]respondent to file an asylum application” (Resp. Br. at 2). The respondent moves to remand the case for a new hearing.
 
The respondent has raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the instant motion. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the Board). In this case, the respondent has not complied with any of Lozada’s procedural requirements. The respondent did not provide detailed affidavits attesting to the facts establishing ineffective assistance and setting forth the agreements that she reportedly entered into with her attorney. She has not informed her prior counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned of the allegations leveled against her and given her an opportunity to respond. Nor have she indicated whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. The respondent has failed entirely to comply with any of Lozada’s procedural requirements, which the Eleventh Circuit has determined are not unduly onerous. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to will be remand is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
M. Elizabeth Hawkins, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Hana A. Sato
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States after determining that he had abandoned his opportunity to seek relief. This matter was before the Board on October 5, 2016, when we affirmed without opinion the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in the Immigration Court. On November 28, 2016, the respondent filed the present motion with the Board, seeking to reopen proceedings on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board has considered the opposition of Department of Homeland Security to the motion, but in consideration of the entirety of the circumstances presented in this matter, the motion will be granted.
 
It appears from the record that counsel wholly failed to file an application for relief and made misrepresentations concerning her failure to act. We are satisfied that the respondent has substantially met applicable procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). As counsel’s performance may have affected the outcome of the case before the Immigration Judge, the motion makes a showing of prejudice to the respondent. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004). The Board will, therefore, reopen these proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) and remand the record to the Immigration Judge to afford the respondent the opportunity to apply for any relief for which he may be eligible. We express no opinion as to the outcome, and on remand the parties should have the opportunity to present any relevant evidence and argument that they may have. The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: These removal proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Azin Arbab, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 1, 2016. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent another continuance and ordered him removed from the United States to Mexico. The record will be remanded.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel where one of his previous attorneys from the Katz Law Office, Jessica Hernandez, Esquire, failed to submit pertinent information and documents on the date the respondent’s individual hearing was scheduled, as requested by the Immigration Judge. At the hearing on September 9, 2015, the Immigration Judge granted a continuance based on a visa petition filed on October 24, 2014, on the respondent’s behalf by his United States citizen wife, who is the mother of his United States citizen child (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 8-9). Due to the respondent’s criminal history, the Immigration Judge also requested that the respondent’s attorney submit several documents at the next hearing, including a copy of the respondent’s criminal conviction records.
 
At the next hearing, on June 1, 2016, the respondent appeared with another attorney from the Katz Law Office, who stated that he had been assigned the case only one week earlier, after the prior attorney assigned to this case, Jessica Hernandez, had suddenly left the law practice and not left detailed notes about the case. The Immigration Judge noted that a number of attorneys from that firm had filed Notices of Appearance on the respondent’s behalf. He further noted that the respondent did not comply with the request for documents made by the Immigration Court and found no good cause to grant a further continuance (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 13 and 16).
 
Although we understand the frustration noted by the Immigration Judge in the handling of this case by the respondent’s prior attorneys, all from the same law firm, the respondent’s arguments on appeal, including his affidavit, are persuasive that he may have received ineffective assistance of counsel from Ms. Hernandez. Even though it does not appear that the respondent has met all the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we are persuaded by the arguments on appeal that Ms. Hernandez appears to have abandoned his case and there was insufficient time for the following attorney assigned to the respondent’s case to prepare and submit the required documents. Under these circumstances, we find that a remand is justified to provide the respondent with an opportunity to pursue his claims for relief.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings and the entry of a new decision consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Elizabeth I. Treacy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In an order dated January 18, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit granted the Government’s motion to remand. The Government sought a remand for the Board to “clarify its conclusion that [respondent] did not comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N 637 (BIA 1988).” After further consideration, we will again dismiss the appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent, who claims ineffective assistance by his former counsel, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on September 21, 2011. Notice is not at issue. As such, a motion to reopen based upon “exceptional circumstances” causing his failure to appear must have been filed within 180 days of the in absentia order of removal. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); see also Matter of A-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998); Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998) (a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day time limit). The respondent, however, did not file his motion to reopen until December 21, 2015. Thus, his motion was untimely.
 
Upon further review, we find that the respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See Marinov v. Holder, 687 F.3d 365 (7th Cir. 2012) (requiring compliance with the Matter of Lozada procedures to establish ineffective assistance of counsel). Specifically, in the instant case, the respondent (1) submitted two personal affidavits regarding his former counsel’s representation of him; (2) presented evidence that he advised her of his allegations of ineffectiveness and submitted her response to those allegations; and (3) provided an explanation as to why he did not file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities.
 
However, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not demonstrated ineffective assistance by his former counsel (I.J. at 5). The respondent argues that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance by not advising him of the consequences of failing to appear at his scheduled September 21, 2011, hearing. However, the record reflects that the respondent did attend his June 8, 2011, hearing with his former counsel, and was served with a notice of hearing advising him of the consequences of failing to appear (I.J. at 4). The respondent has not presented documentary evidence to establish that he was in any way prevented from reading the advisals, or that his former attorney advised him in contradiction to those advisals. Thus, the respondent’s claim that he was unaware of the consequences for not appearing at his September 21, 2011, hearing is unfounded and contradicted by the record of this case. Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated that equitable tolling is warranted in this case. See El- Gazawy v. Holder, 690 F.3d 852, 859 (7th Cir. 2012); Johnson v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 795, 799 (7th Cir. 2007); Patel v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 1011, 1016 (7th Cir. 2006). The respondent has not articulated what effort, if any, he made to pursue his rights during the 4 year period from the entry of his in absentia removal order and the filing of his motion to reopen.
 
*2 Finally, the respondent has not established that sua sponte reopening should be invoked to overcome the untimeliness of his motion. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, as we again decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: RUTILO DE LA SANCHA-TORRES
File: AXXX XX0 947 - New Orleans, LA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Linda L. Walker, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Mexico, appeals from the November 2, 2016, decision of an Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings conducted in absentia on June 30, 2015. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a reply to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
Written notice is considered sufficient if provided at the most recent address provided under section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act. The record reflects that the notice of hearing (NOH) was mailed to the respondent at the address he provided in the Notice to Appear (NTA), but it was returned as undeliverable by the postal service (I.J. at 1; Exhs. 1-3). While the respondent in his motion alleges that the address was entered incorrectly, the respondent signed the NTA, signifying the correctness of the address. Due process was satisfied here because the method of service was reasonably calculated to ensure that notice reached the alien. See United States v. Estrada-Trochez, 66 F.3d 733, 733-36 (5th Cir. 1995).
 
A respondent is not entitled to rescission of a removal order where the failure to receive actual notice of the time of the hearing is the result of his failure to comply with the obligation to keep the Immigration Court apprised of his current mailing address. The alien who evades notice cannot reopen the removal hearing. See Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir. 2009) (finding alien’s failure to keep the Immigration Court apprised of his current mailing address is grounds for denying rescission of a removal order). Consequently, even if we accept the respondent’s assertion that the address was incorrectly entered into the NTA, he did not sufficiently show that his failure to receive actual notice was not due to his neglect of his obligation to correct his address. Moreover, as the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent failed to provide an affidavit or other evidence with the motion to establish what his correct address was at the time the NOH was mailed.
 
On appeal, the respondent through new counsel now alleges he is the victim of ineffective legal assistance from previous counsel, Brett Pouncey, who filed the motion to reopen. Specifically, the respondent alleges that Mr. Pouncey failed to advise the respondent that he needed to support the motion with an affidavit or other evidence. While the respondent’s current counsel maintains in the appeal brief that the respondent will inform Mr. Pouncey of the allegations lodged against him and a copy will be provided to the state bar, no evidence was proffered to support this assertion. Counsel’s arguments are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980). Consequently, the respondent has not complied with the requirements to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948, 953 (5th Cir. 2012) (court requires strict Lozada compliance); Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-98 (5th Cir. 2000) (the Board does not abuse its discretion by requiring compliance with Lozada).
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX4 656 - Baltimore, MD

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kwadwo Addo-Prempeh, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely filed and is denied on that basis. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The motion has not been shown to qualify for any exception to the time limitations imposed by law on motions to reopen.1 The respondent’s status as the beneficiary of a relatively recently approved visa petition does not fall within any of the statutory or regulatory exceptions to the applicable filing deadlines.2 See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 105 (BIA 2009).
 
On this record, the respondent has not provided an adequate basis to excuse the untimeliness of the present motion. Nor has she demonstrated an exceptional situation that would warrant reopening in the exercise of discretion under the Board’s sua sponte authority. See, e.g., Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “[t]he power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion and related request for a stay of removal are denied.

To the extent the respondent claims that she received ineffective assistance from former counsel, she has not complied with the procedural requirements for advancing a claim against former counsel, including the requirement that she show prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Frederick P.S. Whang, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Hana A. Sato
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on June 8, 2016, when we dismissed the respondents’ appeal. On December 15, 2016, more than 6 months after the Board’s order, the respondents filed a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondents’ motion is untimely, as it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondents argue, however, that their proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney Steve Martin, who represented the lead respondent1 in 2005 for his adjustment of status application before the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and who also represented the respondents during parts of these removal proceedings.
 
Specifically, the respondents argue that attorney Martin provided ineffective assistance because: (1) after the respondent retained him in September 2005 for the respondent’s adjustment of status application before the USCIS, he failed to advise the respondent that he should renew his employment authorization, which caused the respondent to continue in an unauthorized employment after his employment authorization expired in November 2006, which in turn resulted in the denial of the respondent’s application for adjustment of status by the USCIS; (2) after the Board dismissed the respondents’ appeal on June 8, 2016, he failed to advise the respondents that they could file a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit within 30 days of the Board’s decision; and (3) he relocated his law office from the State of Washington to the State of Kansas in or about 2014, and did not notify the respondents of his move (Motion, at 4-7). The respondents submitted the respondent’s statement, communications among their various attorneys, and documents showing that they complied with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), with respect to attorney Martin (Motion Exhs. A-B). We will address the respondents’ arguments in turn.
 
First, as to attorney Martin’s failure to advise the respondent to renew his employment authorization with the USCIS in or about 2006, this was a matter that occurred outside these removal proceedings, and indeed before these removal proceedings were initiated in 2008. As noted by the Ninth Circuit, the extent to which aliens are entitled to effective assistance of counsel during deportation or removal proceedings is governed by the Fifth Amendment due process right to a fair hearing. Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004), amended sub nom. Lara-Torres v. Gonzales, 404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir. 2005). To establish a due process violation, aliens must show, inter alia, the alleged ineffective assistance rendered “the proceeding . . . so fundamentally unfair that [they were] prevented from reasonably presenting [their] case.” Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, supra (emphasis added); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 894-97 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
*2 In Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, the Ninth Circuit noted that the purported deficiencies of the attorney’s representation in that case did not “““pertain to the actual substance of the hearing (e.g., evidence presented or omitted, arguments raised or overlooked), let alone call the hearing’s fairness into question.” Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, supra. Rather, the substance of the aliens’ claim was that, had it not been for their reliance on the attorney’s defective immigration law advice, they would not have been subject to removal proceedings at all. Id. This “unfairness,” however, did not taint the “““fairness” of the hearing. Id. The Ninth Circuit also noted that “[w]hen we have characterized counsel’s assistance as ineffective, . . . the legal services were rendered while proceedings were ongoing; that is, after a charging document was filed.” Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, supra, at 974 (emphases original). To the extent the respondents’ ineffective assistance of counsel claim against attorney Martin relates to his failure to provide correct advice to the respondent in 2005 or 2006, and such failure did not affect the fairness of these removal proceedings initiated in 2008. Therefore, the respondents have not shown that a reopening of their removal proceedings is warranted based on the ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
In addition, the claimed ineffective assistance by attorney Martin in 2005 or 2006 long predated the respondent’s previous hearing in 2012. Therefore, these are not “new facts” supported by “new evidence” that was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. Section 240(c)(7)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Furthermore, the respondents have been represented by different attorneys during the course of these proceedings. After the Immigration Judge ordered the respondents removed on September 23, 2009, the respondents were represented by attorney Michael Piston on appeal and in their motion to reconsider filed in 2011. After the Board granted the motion and remanded the proceedings to the Immigration Judge in 2012, the respondents were again represented by attorney Martin before the Immigration Judge at their October 16, 2012, hearing. However, on their second appeal, the respondents were represented by attorney Michele Redburn, who appears to have been associated with attorney Piston’s law practice. The respondent has not explained why attorney Piston or attorney Redburn could not make the ineffective assistance of counsel claim against attorney Martin. If and to the extent attorney Piston and/or attorney Redburn provided ineffective assistance by failing to make an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against attorney Martin, the respondents have not made valid ineffective assistance of counsel claims against these attorneys by satisfying the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, and they have not explained why they could not do so.
 
*3 Next, as to the respondents’ claim that attorney Martin did not advise them about the Board’s June 8, 2016, decision dismissing their appeal or the possibility of filing a timely petition for review with the Ninth Circuit, as noted above the respondents were represented by attorney Redburn, not attorney Martin, on appeal. Despite the respondents’ argument in the motion and again in their Response to the DHS Opposition to their motion, the respondent admits that he was aware that another attorney was representing the respondents on appeal in 2012 (Motion Exh. A, at 14). Furthermore, although the respondent states that in November 2012 he paid a fee of at least $800 to attorney Martin for his appeal to the Board and considered attorney Martin as his “primary attorney,” the documents submitted show that the respondent made a check of $860 to attorney Piston (Motion Exh. A, at 14, 20), and it was attorney Redburn who represented him on appeal. Despite the respondent’s statement that neither attorney Martin nor attorney Piston contacted him regarding the Board’s June 8, 2016, decision, the documents submitted with the motion do not show what arrangement, if any, was in existence regarding the communication to the respondent following the Board’s decision (Motion Exh. A, at 14). The respondents, as noted above, have not made an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against attorney Redburn, nor did they explain why they cannot do so.
 
In any event, the respondent admits that he did receive a courtesy copy of the Board’s decision on his second appeal in June 2016 (Motion Exh. A, at 14). The cover letter to the courtesy copy received by the respondents, a copy of which was submitted with the motion, clearly informed the respondents that, if the attached decision orders that the respondents be removed or affirms an Immigration Judge’s decision ordering them be removed, “any petition for review of the attached decision must be filed with and received by the appropriate court of appeals within 30 days of the date of the decision” (Motion Exh. B. at 30). The respondent admits that he was aware that he could file a review of the Board’s decision in the event the Board dismissed his appeal, because he and attorney Martin had discussed the possibility of a dismissal by the Board and what the next step would be (Motion, at 14).2 Finally, despite the respondents’ assertion that attorney Martin moved his office to Kansas without informing them (Motion, at 7), the respondent’s statement does not show what difficulty, if any, he had in contacting attorney Martin or any other attorney as a result of that move (Motion Exh. A, at 13-14). Rather, the respondent’s statement shows that he only waited for attorney Martin to contact him (Motion Exh. A, at 14), until he received a call-in letter from the DHS in September 2016.
 
Based on the above, the respondents have not shown that their proceedings should be reopened based on the ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney Martin. We also decline to reopen the respondents’ proceedings in the exercise of discretion under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly, the respondents’ motion will be denied. The motion for stay of removal is denied as moot.
 
*4 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondents are a family of husband, wife, and their two children. The adult male respondent is the lead respondent and principal applicant for relief, and will be referred to as the “respondent” in the singular form in this decision.

The respondents’ motion prepared by present counsel states that the respondent was not aware that he could file for further review of the Board’s decision (Motion, at 6-7). However, counsel’s statement in a motion or brief is not evidence. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Furthermore, this assertion is contradicted by the respondent’s own statement, as noted above.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lori B. Schoenberg, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on April 28, 2014, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s December 12, 2013, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia order of removal. The respondent now appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 19, 2016, decision denying his third motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia removal order. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
In our April 28, 2014, decision, we found the respondent is collaterally estopped from seeking to relitigate both his lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel arguments which were raised in his first motion and resolved against him in a final order from which no appeal was taken. See Amrollah v. Napolitano, 710 F.3d 568, 571 (5th Cir. 2013) (“A final decision by an immigration judge has a preclusive effect on future litigation and agency decisions.”). We further found that, because these issues have been finally resolved against him, the respondent’s in absentia removal order can be rescinded and proceedings reopened only “upon a motion filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal [he] demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances” beyond his control. See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) and 1229a(e)(1). Because the respondent’s motion was filed more than 4 years after his in absentia order was entered, we found it to be untimely, and we dismissed his appeal.
 
On November 16, 2016, the respondent filed a third untimely motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia order with the Immigration Judge. In his decision, the Immigration Judge noted again that the respondent is collaterally estopped from relitigating both his lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel claims, which he seeks to do in his current motion (I.J. at 1). See Amrollah v. Napolitano, supra. The Immigration Judge also found that even if the respondent’s current motion is not number-barred and subject to collateral estoppel, he did not establish he has been pursuing his rights diligently and/or some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way preventing him from timely filing such that the deadline should be equitably tolled (I.J. at 2). See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016). As to the respondent’s claim that he has previously unavailable evidence to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), the Immigration Judge noted that the evidence could have and should have been submitted with the respondent’s first motion (I.J. at 2). Therefore, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion.
 
*2 An in absentia order may be rescinded only if: (1) a motion to reopen is filed within 180 days of the date of the final order and the alien demonstrates there were exceptional circumstances excusing his failure to appear; or (2) a motion to reopen is filed at any time and the alien can demonstrate that failure to appear was due to a lack of proper notice. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (2017). As we found in our previous decision, the respondent is collaterally estopped from relitigating the issues of lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel. See Amrollah v. Napolitano, supra. Further, the respondent’s current motion is both time and number-barred.
 
Contrary to the respondent’s appellate assertions, the Immigration Judge did consider the issue of whether the motions deadline should be equitably tolled (I.J. at 2). See Mata v. Lynch, 135 S.Ct. 2150 (2015). In Lugo-Resendez, the Fifth Circuit instructed that the Board to should determine whether the respondent established: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing, such that equitable tolling applies. See id. (internal citations omitted). The first element requires the respondent to establish he pursued his rights with “reasonable diligence,” not “maximum feasible diligence.” See id. (internal citations omitted). The second element requires the respondent to establish an “extraordinary circumstance beyond his control” prevented him from complying with the applicable deadline. See id. (internal citations omitted). The Fifth Circuit also directed that we must consider the individual facts and circumstances of each case in determining whether equitable tolling is appropriate. See id. at 344-45 (internal citations omitted).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that, based on the facts in this case, the respondent has not shown the required due diligence (I.J. at 2). See id. Specifically, the respondent has not shown he has been pursuing his rights diligently or that some extraordinary circumstance prevented him from timely filing. See id. The respondent was first ordered removed in January 2010 and was thereafter detained in November 2012, but he did not follow-up with his prior counsel, whom he now makes ineffective assistance of counsel claims against, during that period of time (I.J. at 2). It was only after the respondent was detained in 2012 that he took significant action (I.J. at 2). Further, the respondent did not file the instant motion until 2 years after his petition for review was summarily dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (I.J. at 2). See id. The respondent’s arguments on appeal are lengthy but not persuasive. The respondent’s motion is time and number-barred, subject to collateral estoppel pertaining to his lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel arguments, and he has not established that equitable tolling is warranted. See id.
 
*3 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: SAMUEL GOMEZ A.K.A. SAMUEL MARTINEZ GOMEZ A.K.A. SAMUEL MARTINEZ
File: AXXX XX1 930 - Houston, TX
April 6, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
 
This case has a lengthy procedural history. On May 17, 2013, an Immigration Judge granted the Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) motion to pretermit the respondent’s application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a).1 In reaching his decision, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not meet his burden to establish that he had been lawfully admitted to the United States in 1993 as she claimed.
 
The respondent appealed, and on August 22, 2014, the Board dismissed the appeal finding that the record did not show that the respondent was admitted as a temporary resident in 1993 as he claimed or paroled into the United States as required by section 245(a) of the Act. We also concluded that even if he was admitted in 1993 as a temporary resident, the record reflected that his temporary resident status expired in 1994. We concluded that when the temporary resident status expired, the respondent’s status reverted to that of an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. Our conclusion was based on 8 C.F.R. § 245a.2(u)(4), which provides as follows:
Return to unlawful status after termination. Termination of the status of any alien previously adjusted to lawful temporary residence under section 245A(a) of the Act shall act to return such alien to the unlawful status held prior to the adjustment, and render him or her amenable to exclusion or deportation proceedings under section 236 or 242 of the Act, as appropriate.
 
8 C.F.R. § 245a.2(u)(4).
 
On November 14, 2014, the respondent filed with the Board a timely motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We denied the motion on January 26, 2015.
 
The respondent filed a petition to review our decisions with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, under whose jurisdiction this case arises. On April 20, 2016, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the Board’s conclusion that the respondent was never lawfully admitted and denied the petition for review. Gomez v. Lynch, 819 F.3d 769 (5th Cir. 2016), superseded by 831 F.3d 652 (5th Cir. 2016).2
 
*2 After that decision, the respondent and the DHS filed with the Fifth Circuit a joint motion to vacate because the DHS located evidence confirming that the respondent had been admitted into the United States in 1993 as the respondent had previously claimed. The Fifth Circuit granted the motion to vacate its April 20, 2016, opinion and accepted briefing from the parties on the interpretation of 8 C.F.R. § 245a.2(u)(4).
 
The case is now before the Board pursuant to the Fifth Circuit’s August 5, 2016, remand order. Gomez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 652 (5th Cir. 2016). The court agreed with the respondent that his 1993 admission, which occurred while he held temporary resident status, was not affected by his unlawful status in the United States. Id. at 658, 662.
 
The court reasoned that status and admission are fundamentally different concepts. Id. at 658-60. Citing to Matter of Quinlantan, 25 I&N Dec. 285 (BIA 2010), the court noted that an admission is defined in wholly factual and procedural terms. An alien “who presents himself at an immigration checkpoint, undergoes a procedurally regular inspection, and is given permission to enter the United States has been admitted, regardless of whether he had any underlying legal right to do so.” Id. at 658. The court explained status as the type of permission to be present in the United States. The Fifth Circuit stated that “[because] the concepts are separate, an alien can be admitted despite the absence of any lawful status, as when an immigration officer accidentally processes him through a checkpoint.” Id. at 658-59. Conversely, “an alien who was admitted in a lawful status can acquire unlawful status, as by overstaying a visa - but that does not mean he was never admitted.” Id. at 659.
 
The court also explained that section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a) includes the admission/status distinction by providing separate bars to adjustment of status with different exceptions and is addressed in different subsections of the Act. Finally, the court explained that the regulatory language of 8 C.F.R. § 245a.2(u)(4) that provides for an alien to return to a previous unlawful status does not undo a factual admission that occurred during the time when the alien was in lawful status. Id. at 662.
 
Thus, although the respondent returned to his previous unlawful status when his temporary resident status expired, his lack of status did not undo his historical, factual admission for purposes of adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(a) of the Act. We conclude that a remand is warranted for the Immigration Judge to consider the respondent’s application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act. On remand the parties should have the opportunity to update the record regarding the respondent’s application.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The Board’s August 22, 2014, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Luther Snavely, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Fair hearing
 
*1 On December 5, 2016, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and granted him voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), in lieu of removal. The respondent waived appeal. On January 4, 2017, the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal in which he asserts that his former attorney’s handling of his case deprived him of his right to due process, and he seeks remand to the Immigration Judge to enable him to apply for relief from removal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Generally, the decision of an Immigration Judge becomes final immediately upon the waiver of an alien’s right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate a case in which the alien has waived the right to appeal. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). The record reveals that the Immigration Judge’s decision was personally served on the respondent and his attorney on December 5, 2016. The respondent has not set forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board). Further, the respondent does not claim that the waiver of the appeal was not knowing and voluntary. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322-23 (BIA 2000). Under the circumstances, we will dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and return the record to the Immigration Judge. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Judge.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Shirley C. Zambrano, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before us on January 23, 2017, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion to remand proceedings based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reconsider this decision on February 22, 2017. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent has not advanced any specific argument regarding any error in our prior decision, and we find no error in law or fact, or argument that was overlooked, that would warrant further consideration of his claim. See generally Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The respondent argues that the Board erred in finding that he had not substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), but we find no error in this conclusion (Bd. Dec. at 1-2). With his motion, the respondent has now filed various notarized statements as well as evidence that he filed a grievance against his prior attorney with the State Bar of Georgia. Cast as a motion to reopen, the respondent has not adequately demonstrated that such evidence “was not available and could not have been discovered or presented” with his appeal and motion to remand. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, the respondent has presented no additional evidence that would alter our previous conclusion that the respondent has not been prejudiced by any action or inaction by his former counsel (Bd. Dec. at 2). Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 1984). The additional statements the respondent has now submitted are not a basis for reconsideration or reopening.1
 
Given the above findings, we also find no reason to disturb our previous rejection of the respondent’s due process claim (I.J. at 2). We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s or this Board’s reliance on counsel’s indication that the respondent had admitted the allegations and conceded removability (Tr. at 9). See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). As such, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

We note that although the respondent has asserted that he did not have time to discuss his sexual orientation with counsel and did not know it could be a basis for an asylum claim, he has also stated that he did not disclose the information because he had not told his parents about it.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eli A. Echols, Esquire
*1 A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was mailed on January 11, 2017. The appeal was accordingly due on or before February 10, 2017. The record reflects, however, that the Notice of Appeal was mailed after the due date and filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on February 21, 2017. The respondent asks that the late appeal be accepted because her prior attorney failed to inform her of the date of the Immigration Judge’s decision and of her right to appeal. However, the respondent provides no details or evidence to support this claim, nor has she made an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We find that the appeal is untimely. The Immigration Judge’s decision is accordingly now final, and the record will be returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.
 
Because we are dismissing the appeal as untimely, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See sections 240(c)(6)(A) & (B) and 240(c)(7)(A) & (C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6)(A) & (B) and (c)(7)(A) & (C); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jack E. Wallace, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christopher Santora
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on August 19, 2016, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 25, 2015, decision ordering the respondent removed from the United States to Mexico. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings, on November 16, 2016, based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
Due to the issues raised in this motion, we will set forth the procedural history of the case. The respondent was served with a Notice to Appear on April 8, 2013, alleging, inter alia, that the respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico (Exh. 1). The DHS thereafter filed a Form I-213 and a Mexican Consular ID card with the respondent’s name and purported photo. The Form I-213 indicates that the respondent “is a citizen and national of Mexico by virtue of birth on June 28, 1986.” On March 24, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to suppress these documents before the Immigration Judge. Therein, he argued, inter alia, that the DHS’ Form I-213 and ID evidence arose from an illegal arrest, and he sought to terminate proceedings. However, the respondent attached a declaration to his motion which admitted that he was “born in San Geronimo de los Dolores, Mexico, on June 28, 1986.” Thereafter, on April 7, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to retract this declaration, and to substitute a similar declaration without the respondent’s admission of alienage.
 
In a decision dated May 20, 2014, the Immigration Judge found “no just cause” to grant the motion to retract and substitute the respondent’s declarations, and, relying on the respondent’s declaration of alienage, he found the motion to suppress moot (May 20, 2014, I.J. Dec. at 2). The Immigration Judge then shifted the burden to the respondent, under section 291 of the Act, to establish time, place, and manner of entry. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(c). In a pleading dated January 16, 2015, the respondent did not deny his alienage, but also declined to offer evidence on the time, place or manner of his entry. The Immigration Judge ultimately found, in a decision dated February 25, 2015, that the respondent had conceded his alienage and that he had not demonstrated that he had any lawful status in the United States (Feb. 25, 2015, I.J. Dec. at 2-3). Inasmuch as the respondent also did not seek relief from removal, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed to Mexico pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act (Feb. 25, 2015, I.J. Dec. at 3). On August 19, 2016, this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal, finding that the respondent had not demonstrated an exception to the general rule set forth in Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986), in which we held that an alien’s lawyer’s admissions in immigration proceedings are binding absent “egregious circumstances.”
 
*2 The respondent subsequently filed this ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In support of his motion, the respondent has complied with the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, 18 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Moreover, he argues that the admission of alienage was not a tactical decision, but rather a material “mistake” evidenced by the fact that the basis of his entire motion to suppress involved the suppression of his alienage. He lastly argues that he suffered prejudice due to this mistake because he would have likely had his motion to suppress granted and his proceedings terminated.
 
We disagree. The respondent has cited various cases in which courts have found that nonstrategic admissions of counsel constitute deficient performance. See Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 166 (5th Cir. 2006) (“the effect of admitting the false claim of citizenship charge was to cut off all available avenues of relief”); Hinton v. State, 854 So.2d 254 (Fla.Dist.Ct App. 2003) (finding that when counsel concedes guilt to a charged offense without client’s consent, counsel is presumed ineffective); Nixon v. Singletary, 758 So.2d 618 (Fla. 2000) (holding that counsel’s concession of guilt without defendant’s consent during opening and closing is per se ineffective); Salazar-Gonzalez v. Lynch, 798 F.3d 917 (9th Cir. 2015) (failure to file appeal was not tactical); Benitez-Saldana v. State, 67 So.3d 320 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2011) (where counsel’s factual concessions during opening before jury resulted in conviction, representation was presumed ineffective). We find these cases inapposite to the respondent’s case because they either involve issues in criminal court, or they involve tactical legal issues rather than factual admissions, or both.1 Too many differences in representational rights and standards exist between jury trials in criminal proceedings and the respondent’s immigration proceedings to find these cases persuasive.
 
As such, we find no reason to disturb our previous finding that “no unreasonable professional judgment was involved in the respondent’s admission” (Bd. Dec. at 2). Moreover, we do not find that the respondent has demonstrated the necessary prejudice under Matter of Lozada, supra. While the respondent states, in a conclusory manner, that there is a “reasonable likelihood that the outcome of (the respondent’s) case would have been different” without the concession of alienage, we find this assumption speculative. As we previously noted, neither party has alleged that the respondent’s declaration of alienage is untrue, and insufficient evidence exists to reason that the Immigration Judge might have terminated the respondent’s proceedings absent his admission of alienage. In so finding, we note that the respondent did not proffer evidence once the burden shifted to him to demonstrate the time, place and manner of his entry (Bd. Dec. at 1; Feb. 25, 2015, I.J. Dec. at 2-3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(c). As such, the following order will be entered.

CERTIFICATION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven K. Wichmer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kimberly A. Burgess
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on October 31, 2016, when we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for preparation of a decision pursuant to Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999). Previously, the respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeared before an Immigration Judge on September 22, 2015, and agreed to voluntarily depart the United States by January 20, 2016. On December 21, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to reopen which the Immigration Judge denied in an order dated January 21, 2016, from which the respondent appealed. The Immigration Judge prepared a written decision, dated November 22, 2016, and has certified the record back to the Board. The decision of the Immigration Judge will be affirmed.
 
The Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
In his appellate brief, the respondent argues that he is a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, inasmuch as his former counsel allegedly did not advise him of the availability of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (Convention) (Resp. Brief at 4-9). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel). However, there is no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s former counsel advised him of the availability of those forms of relief and protection from removal.
 
The record contains a January 12, 2016, letter from the respondent’s former counsel. Therein, counsel states that he discussed with the respondent on November 10, 2014, January 27, 2015, and September 2015, several forms of relief from removal, including whether the respondent fears persecution in Mexico (Letter at 3). According to the letter, the respondent stated that he did not fear persecution in Mexico. Counsel states that he then determined that the respondent did not have a bona fide claim to asylum, and that voluntary departure was his only viable form of relief from removal. In addition, the record contains a September 22, 2015, notice signed by the respondent in which he affirmed that he would not request asylum and understood his obligation to voluntarily depart the United States. The respondent has also not provided sufficient evidence establishing that there is a reasonable possibility that he would be granted relief or protection from removal at a reopened hearing (I.J. at 3). Hence, the respondent has not established that the advice that he received from his former counsel was incorrect. In light of the foregoing, there is no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent knowingly waived his opportunity to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention. It follows that the respondent has not established that he is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 In addition, the respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying reopening of these proceedings based on the respondent’s submission of previously unavailable material evidence, specifically his Form I-589 application for asylum (Resp. Brief at 9-10). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3) (providing that a motion to reopen will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). However, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent previously waived the opportunity to file the application, and furthermore, that the proffered application did not present a viable claim for relief.
 
Moreover, the respondent argues on appeal that he established an exceptional situation to reopen these proceedings sua sponte (Resp. Brief at 10). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s and the Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). He states that he has resided in the United States for a lengthy period, has maintained gainful employment, has a citizen son, and he is afraid to return to Mexico. However, the respondent waived his opportunity to apply for relief from removal at the hearing. Hence, we decline to reopen these proceedings sua sponte.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The decision of the Immigration Judge is affirmed.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s March 7, 2016, decision granting him voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) requests that we summarily affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings with regard to credibility and the likelihood of future events, to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see Hui Lin Huang v. Holder, 677 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir. 2012) (holding that a determination of what will occur in the future and the degree of likelihood of the occurrence is a finding of fact subject only to clear error review); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review de novo all questions of law, discretion, and judgment and any other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On March 7, 2016, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent pre-conclusion voluntary departure and required that he depart the United States by April 6, 2016. On appeal, the respondent claims that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision (Respondent’s Brief at 4). However, his attorney during proceedings before the Immigration Judge expressly waived his right to appeal (Tr. at 22). The respondent claims on appeal that he has never received advice on voluntary departure (Respondent’s Brief at 9). He also claims that if he had known what voluntary departure was, he would have not taken it because it was never his intention to leave the United States (Respondent’s Brief at 9).1 However, the record reveals that the respondent repeatedly testified that he understood he must leave the United States within 30 days, Tr. at 45-47.
 
The respondent was represented by counsel below and the request for voluntary departure and the waiver of appeal made by counsel are binding on the respondent. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal concession made by counsel is binding on the alien); see also Hoodho v. Holder, 558 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir. 2009) (holding that facts admitted by a party are “judicial admissions” that bind that party throughout the litigation).
 
*2 Furthermore, to the extent the respondent attributes his lack of knowledge about voluntary departure to his prior counsel, who represented him before the Immigration Judge, the respondent has not meaningfully set forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In particular, while we recognize that the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit only requires substantial compliance to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), the respondent has not established that he substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, supra. See Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46-47 (2d Cir. 2005).2
 
Inasmuch as the respondent’s attorney expressly waived appeal, the conditions for granting pre-conclusion voluntary departure have been met. See section 240B(a) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D); see also Matter of Ocampo, 22 I&N Dec. 1301 (BIA 2000) (holding that pre-conclusion voluntary departure may not be granted prior to the completion of removal proceedings without an express waiver of the right to appeal).3 Therefore, the respondent is not permitted to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision to this Board. Accordingly, we find that this case is not properly before us. The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993).4
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

However, at the hearing, the respondent testified before the Immigration Judge that if the Immigration Judge granted him voluntary departure he had the funds to depart and was willing to do so (Tr. at 29).

2

In order to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must submit the following: (1) an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement with former counsel concerning what action would be taken and what counsel did or did not represent in this regard; (2) proof that the former counsel was notified of the allegations of ineffective assistance and allowed an opportunity to respond; and (3) if a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities is claimed, a statement as to whether the alien has filed a complaint with any disciplinary authority regarding counsel’s conduct and, if not, an explanation for not doing so. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639.

3

The respondent claims in his Notice of Appeal that the Immigration Judge erred by not giving him voluntary departure of 120 days. However, he does not pursue this argument in his brief on appeal. Furthermore, the statute regarding pre-conclusion voluntary departure does not require that the Immigration Judge grant 120 days of voluntary departure. Rather, section 240B(a)(2)(A) of the Act provides that permission to depart voluntarily shall not be valid for a period exceeding 120 days.

4

Therefore, we need not consider the respondent’s request for administrative closure for DHS to consider his request for prosecutorial discretion. Similarly, we cannot consider the respondent’s request for remand. Furthermore, prosecutorial discretion is not within the purview of the Board or Immigration Judge.

IN RE: ARTURO NERI-VELASCO
File: AXXX XX8 038 - Phoenix, AZ
March 20, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher John Stender, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; administrative closure; voluntary departure; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s March 28, 2016, decision denying his motion to continue and alternative motion to administratively close proceedings. The respondent also moves for a remand. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a response. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred by denying his motion for continuance. We disagree. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent asserted this reason for his request for a continuance: that he was dissatisfied with prior counsel and so he wanted a new lawyer to advise him of any available defenses and relief from removal, and have time to make a Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request (I.J. at 2-3; Resp. Motion to Continue). An Immigration Judge “may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. The respondent has not established that “good cause” existed to further continue these removal proceedings. See id; Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 815 (BIA 2012) (recognizing that a continuance should not be granted where it is being sought “as a dilatory tactic to forestall the conclusion of removal proceedings”).
 
Moreover, the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by the continuance denial, as he has not shown that he is eligible for any other forms of relief from removal or that any FOIA request made during the pendency of this appeal resulted in a material discovery. See Cinapian v. Holder, 567 F.3d 1067, 1074-75 (9th Cir. 2009). On appeal, the respondent adds that a continuance was necessary to obtain evidence to support his request for prosecutorial discretion from the DHS. However, the respondent did not present this as a basis for the continuance, and moreover, neither the Board nor the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction over issues of prosecutorial discretion. See Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 349-50 (BIA 1982). The respondent also states that a continuance would have helped him obtain evidence to support his motion for administrative closure (resp. Br. at 7-8). However, it is not clear how he would have shown that he warranted administrative closure with no form of relief available to him. In addition, during the pendency of this appeal, the respondent has not submitted any evidence of his DUI conviction being vacated. Therefore, the respondent has not demonstrated that the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny him a continuance was in error or that he experienced prejudice as a result. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983) (noting that an alien must show that the denial of the continuance caused actual prejudice).
 
*2 We agree with the respondent that it appears the Immigration Judge implicitly denied his motion for administrative closure. The Immigration Judge acknowledged the motion in his decision, but ultimately, it is not clear if he explicitly denied the motion (I.J. at 2, 4). Accordingly, the respondent moves for a remand for the Immigration Judge to explicitly adjudicate the motion.1 However, because we have de novo review authority over discretionary issues, such as the motion at issue, we deem it unnecessary to remand to the Immigration Judge for adjudication of the motion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). In addition, our consideration of the motion relies on no new findings of fact. The respondent has not shown that he warrants administrative closure of these proceedings. See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688, 696 (BIA 2012) (outlining factors for evaluating whether administrative closure is warranted, including the likelihood of success on any underlying requests for relief).2 We observe that administrative closure is used to temporarily remove a case from an Immigration Judge’s active calendar or from the Board’s docket. See Matter of Gutierrez, 21 I&N Dec. 479, 480 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Avetisyan, supra, at 692. The administrative closure of a case does not result in a final order. It is merely an administrative convenience that allows cases to be removed from the calendar in appropriate situations, subject to being recalendared at a later date. See Matter of Amico, 19 I&N Dec. 652, 654 n.1 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent sought administrative closure to seek prosecutorial discretion from the DHS (Resp. Mot. To Administratively Close Proceedings). However, while the respondent argues that he may have been eligible for prosecutorial discretion, as noted above, the DHS has sole authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion in this matter. See Matter of Quintero, supra. In addition, the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent had no apparent relief available to him other than voluntary departure (I.J. at 2). The DHS did not state whether it opposed administrative closure in this case, and it is unknown if the DHS had declined to exercise prosecutorial discretion or has since issued a formal decision on any such request in this matter. Accordingly, we have considered: the reasons for which the respondent sought administrative closure; the unlikelihood that the respondent would succeed on any petition, application, or other action he was pursuing outside of removal proceedings; and the lack of showing that administrative closure would affect the ultimate outcome of these proceedings. Id. at 695. Based on the foregoing and our de novo review of the matter, the discretionary benefit of administrative closure would not have been appropriate in this case. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505 (BIA 1980) (once the DHS institutes proceedings, an Immigration Judge must order an alien deported if the evidence supports the charge); Matter of Avetisyan, supra, at 696. Accordingly, we will deny the respondent’s motion to remand for the Immigration Judge to adjudicate his motion for administrative closure. See, e.g., de Jesus Melendez v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 1019, 1023 n.1 (9th Cir. 2007) (futile remands are not required).
 
*3 Finally, to the extent the respondent asserts that his due process rights were violated in the proceedings below, we are unpersuaded. See Cruz Rendon v. Holder, 603 F.3d 1104 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding that in order to prevail on a due process claim that she was denied a full and fair removal hearing, an alien must demonstrate that the challenged proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that she was prevented from reasonably presenting her case; and that she suffered prejudice, such that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged violation). The respondent has not established that he suffered prejudice such that the outcome of these proceedings may have been affected by the Immigration Judge’s decision, including the absence of an explicit adjudication of his motion for administrative closure.
 
Moreover, in reference to the respondent’s contentions regarding his former counsel(s), the respondent has also not complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, or demonstrated that he suffered resultant prejudice. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Additionally, because the respondent has not shown that, but for his prior counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, he would have obtained post-conviction relief and been eligible for any other form of relief, i.e., besides voluntary departure, he has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s ineffective assistance. Thus, overall, we conclude that remanded proceedings are not warranted on this basis.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to remand is denied
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
*4 WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if she provides to the DHS such evidence of her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

In Matter of Avetisyan, the Board held that, in determining whether administrative closure of proceedings is appropriate, an Immigration Judge or the Board should weigh all the relevant factors presented in the case. These factors include, but are not limited to: (1) the reason administrative closure is sought; (2) the basis for any opposition to administrative closure; (3) the likelihood the respondent will succeed on any petition, application, or other action he or she is pursuing outside of removal proceedings; (4) the anticipated duration of the closure; (5) the responsibility of either party, if any, in contributing to any current or anticipated delay; and (6) the ultimate outcome of removal proceedings (for example, termination of the proceedings or entry of a removal order) when the case is recalendared before the Immigration Judge or the appeal is reinstated before the Board.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Karla L. Kraus, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
J.L. Woodmansee
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on September 4, 2014, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his request for a continuance but granting him the privilege of voluntary departure. On October 12, 2016, the respondent filed a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the respondent’s motion. The respondent’s motion to reopen will be granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.§ 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). The respondent, however, has submitted sufficient evidence to establish that equitable tolling of the filing deadline is warranted in his case. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating that equitable tolling of the time limit for a motion to reopen is available “when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error”). The respondent also has satisfied the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Finally, the respondent has established that he was prejudiced by the errors of his prior attorney. See Matter of Lozada, supra. In particular, the respondent has established that this Board did not reinstate the Immigration Judge’s grant of voluntary departure because the respondent’s prior attorney did not file proof that the respondent had paid the required voluntary departure bond. The respondent, in fact, had paid the bond in a timely manner.
 
In addition, it appears that the respondent might have become eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1), while his case was on appeal to this Board. His motion indicates that his United States citizen daughter was born in December 2013, but his prior attorney did not file a motion to remand to pursue cancellation. The DHS states in its opposition to the current motion that the respondent’s voluntary return to Mexico makes him ineligible for cancellation, but the record does not contain sufficient evidence to establish that any of the respondent’s prior departures constitute breaks in presence. See Matter of Garcia-Ramirez, 26 I&N Dec. 674 (BIA 2015); Matter of Castrejon-Colino, 26 I&N Dec. 667 (BIA 2015). This issue also was not addressed in any detail during the respondent’s hearing before the Immigration Judge, and both the Immigration Judge’s decision and our prior ruling in the respondent’s case were issued before our decisions in Matter of Castrejon-Colino, supra, and Matter of Garcia-Ramirez, supra.
 
*2 Based on the foregoing, we grant the respondent’s motion to reopen and we remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings to determine if the respondent is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, or, in the alternative, to give him the opportunity to apply for voluntary departure.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Saman J. Nasseri, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lorely R. Fernandez
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeared before an Immigration Judge on July 8, 2010, and, pursuant to the respondent’s own motion, was ordered removed from the United States. On October 17, 2016, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, and appeals from the Immigration Judge’s October 26, 2016, decision denying the motion. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he is a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, inasmuch as his former attorney did not advise him of the availability of voluntary departure. He requests that the Board equitably toll the 90-day period to file his motion, and reopen and remand these proceedings for a voluntary departure hearing.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion. See Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647-48 (5th Cir. 2014) (making mandatory strict compliance with the Lozada requirements and emphasizing that former counsel must be informed of the allegations against them before the allegations are presented in a brief to the Board); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel). Most notably, the respondent has not established that he submitted a complaint against his former counsel with an appropriate disciplinary authority and informed counsel of the allegations. Hence, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. We therefore affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to decline equitable tolling of the 90-day period to file a motion to reopen. The respondent’s motion is therefore untimely.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Juan L. Rocha, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julie Nelson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 22, 2016, denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judge denied the motion because it was untimely and the respondent did not establish that he warranted sua sponte reopening.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). The respondent’s proceedings concluded in December 2011, and he filed the instant motion in July 2016. Thus, the respondent’s motion is untimely by over 4 years. The respondent did not argue that equitable tolling applies as an exception to the filing deadline, and thus, the Immigration Judge did not consider if such exception would apply here. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that equitable tolling is available when an individual is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud or error, and exercised due diligence in discovering such circumstances). Thus, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion as untimely filed.
 
We also affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion to reopen sua sponte.1 Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances). The Immigration Judge ruled that the proceedings do not warrant sua sponte reopening based on the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). At the outset, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not establish compliance with the procedural requirements to assert an ineffective assistance of counsel claim pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (I.J. at 4-6).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent contends that he did submit with his motion evidence of his notice to former counsel of his intent to file a motion based on ineffective assistance, as well as former counsel’s response (Resp. Br. at 4). He also argues that he was not required to file a complaint with the state bar or explain his failure to do so, and that his claim was based on his last attorney of record, Mr. Darius Amiri (Id.). The record does not contain the evidence the respondent asserts that he filed with his motion. The respondent’s submission of this evidence with his brief on appeal is insufficient, as he was required to file such proof with his motion before the Immigration Judge. Thus, based upon this lack of proof, the Immigration Judge properly found that respondent did not satisfy the procedural requirements for proving that he was ineffectively represented by his former attorney in these proceedings. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639 (noting that the procedural requirements for filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim are “necessary if we are to have a basis for assessing the substantial number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.... Where essential information is lacking, it is impossible to evaluate the substance of such claim.”).
 
Moreover, the requirement that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim demonstrate the filing of a bar complaint serves to deter meritless claims and highlights the standards that should be expected of attorneys who represent aliens in immigration proceedings. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. It also serves to protect against collusion between alien and counsel in which ““““ineffective assistance” is tolerated, and goes unchallenged by an alien before disciplinary authorities, because it results in a benefit to the alien in that delay can be a desired end, in itself, in immigration proceedings. Matter of Rivera-Claws, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 604 (BIA 1996). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, does not require strict compliance with Matter of Lozada where “counsel’s ineffective assistance was obvious and undisputed on the face of the record.” Reyes v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1126, 1130 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000)). The respondent’s motion stated that he did file a bar complaint; however, on appeal he appears to state that he did not file a bar complaint because his former counsel’s ineffective assistance is plain on the face of the record, or on the other hand, he was trying to avoid filing a complaint so Mr. Amiri could explain his strategy (Resp. Br. at 7-9). We look to the motion as filed before the Immigration Judge, and note that the respondent did not present to the Immigration Judge proof of filing a bar complaint or Mr. Amiri’s response to his notice, and did not establish that the assistance was ineffective on the face of the record.
 
*3 Moreover, while not considered by the Immigration Judge, we note that the respondent’s motion was not supported by an application for cancellation of removal; and he has not submitted sufficient evidence showing that he has a qualifying relative who might suffer hardship rising to the level of ““““exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” upon his removal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3) (providing that a motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and “all supporting documentation”). Thus, the respondent did not establish a basis to reopen to apply for cancellation of removal. Likewise, with no accompanying application and supporting documentation, he has not established prejudice from any alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 669 (1984) (holding that a showing of prejudice requires that there be “a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.”).
 
Considering the totality of the respondent’s circumstances, we are not persuaded to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision. Thus, we concur in the Immigration Judge’s decision to not exercise his sua sponte authority to reopen these proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

It is not evident from the respondent’s motion that he requested sua sponte reopening. However, because the Immigration Judge considered sua sponte reopening, we consider the denial of the motion on this basis, as well.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Fairuze Sofia, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kimberly Hillery
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)] - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
 
APPLICATION: Temporary Protected Status
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s May 24, 2016, decision denying his application for Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent conceded that he is removable and sought TPS before the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 3; Exhs. 1, 3). His prior grant of TPS had been withdrawn in 2012 after the respondent did not re-register in 2009 (I.J. at 4; Exh. 2 at 1, 3). It does not appear that the respondent filed an appeal with the Administrative Appeals Unit (see Exh. 2 at 3). The respondent next tried to re-register in 2012 (I.J. at 5; Tr. at 34). The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for relief, finding that he did not establish good cause sufficient to excuse his failure to re-register (I.J. at 5-6). The respondent appeals from that decision.
 
Section 244(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(5), sets forth that any administrative procedure for the review of the denial of TPS benefits shall not prevent an alien from asserting TPS protection in removal proceedings if the alien demonstrates that he or she is a national of a state designated under section 244(b)(1) of the Act. The regulations set forth at 8 C.F.R. part 1244, in turn, provide that an alien has the right to a de novo determination of his or her eligibility for TPS before an Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1244.10(d)(1), 1244.11, 1244.18(b). Thus, the respondent is eligible to assert his right to TPS while in removal proceedings. See Matter of Barrientos, 24 I&N Dec. 100, 102 (BIA 2007). He retains this eligibility even though he did not exhaust internal DHS appeal procedures. Matter of Lopez-Aldana, 25 I&N Dec. 49, 51 (BIA 2009).
 
*2 Aliens granted TPS must register annually. See 8 C.F.R. § 1244.17(a). Failure to do so, absent good cause, will cause the withdrawal of TPS. See section 244(c)(3)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1244.14(a)(3), 1244.17(c).
 
In this case, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish good cause sufficient to excuse his failure to re-register for TPS. The respondent testified that he did not re-register because he was planning on returning to El Salvador in 2009 (I.J. at 5; Tr. at 34). The respondent testified that he ultimately decided not to travel to that country (I.J. at 5; Tr. at 34, 36). However, at that point, the time for re-registration had passed (I.J. at 5; Tr. at 34). He also contends that he received incorrect advice from a notary regarding the re-registration requirement (I.J. at 4; Tr. at 34). The respondent’s testimony about the notary was brief and without much detail. We are not convinced that the respondent demonstrated good cause, particularly where he conceded that he had re-registered for TPS for several years before 2009 (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 33-34).
 
The respondent in the alternative contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel repeatedly incorrectly indicated that the respondent was ineligible for TPS due to his criminal record (Respondent’s Brief at 5-7; I.J. at 3-4; see, e.g., Tr. at 4-7, 17-18). The respondent further contends that his counsel did not question him regarding his reasons for not re-registering for TPS until the Immigration Judge prompted him to do so (Respondent’s Brief at 6-7; Tr. at 33). We note that in each instance, the Immigration Judge took prompt corrective action. For instance, she noted that the respondent was denied TPS because he did not reregister, rather than because of his criminal history (I.J. at 3-4; Tr. at 17-20). Furthermore, she prompted the respondent’s counsel to question the respondent about his reasons for not reregistering (Tr. at 33). The Immigration Judge’s corrective actions at the very least tend to obviate any prejudice to the respondent. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988) (noting that a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires a showing of prejudice).
 
More fundamentally, the respondent did not comply with the requirements announced in Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent did not submit an affidavit from himself attesting to the relevant facts. Id. at 639. The respondent also has not demonstrated that he informed his counsel of the allegations and provided an opportunity for that counsel to respond. Id. Lastly, the record does not reflect that the respondent filed a complaint with the relevant disciplinary board or otherwise explained why he did not do so. Id. As such, the respondent has not set forth a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jared S. Lawrence, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s November 2, 2016, decision finding the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal abandoned and ordering him removed. We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment arising in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo, whereas we review findings of fact in such appeals under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
On appeal counsel alleges that prior counsel provided ineffective assistance to the respondent by failing to file his application for cancellation of removal by the date set by the Immigration Judge, which failure led the Immigration Judge to deem the application abandoned. Counsel has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 1988), in which we set out the procedural requirements for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Respondent’s December 2, 2016, Motion to Remand. We therefore conclude that the respondent has established ineffective assistance below, and we therefore will remand the record to provide the respondent the opportunity to file his relief application with the Immigration Judge.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

*1 On July 11, 2016, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s second motion to reissue the Immigration Judge’s December 21, 2015, decision. The respondent has appealed from the denial. The record does not contain a response from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); see, e.g., Ridore v. Holder, 696 F.3d 907, 915 (9th Cir. 2012) (discussing Board’s scope of review).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. He was ordered removed by an Immigration Judge in Lancaster, California on November 22, 2000, and was subsequently removed from the United States. On May 31, 2005, an Immigration Judge in Eloy, Arizona, entered a second order of removal against him and he again was removed from the United States. In 2013, the DHS reinstated the 2005 order of removal against the respondent and removed him from the United States for a third time.
 
On December 8, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to reopen his 2000 proceeding.1 The Immigration Judge denied this motion, but the respondent was unable to file an appeal due to errors in the office of his current counsel. The respondent filed a motion to reissue with the Immigration Judge in March 2016 explaining the errors, but the Immigration Judge denied the motion. The respondent filed a second motion to reissue on June 20, 2016. The Immigration Judge again denied the motion, and the respondent now has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision.2
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he had not satisfied the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988), or substantially complied with these requirements. The respondent further claims that he has acted with reasonable diligence and shown prejudice. Accordingly, he maintains that the Immigration Judge should have equitably tolled the time and numeric limits on his motion and granted reissuance. Finally, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge should have granted his motion in the interest of justice pursuant to her sua sponte authority.
 
The Immigration Judge is correct that the respondent’s second motion to reissue is untimely and numerically barred (I.J. at 2). Further, even if the respondent did act diligently in pursuing his motions to reissue and did comply or substantially comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, he has not shown prejudice. See Siong v. INS, 376 F.3d 1030, 1037 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting that prejudice is presumed when counsel’s error deprives alien of appellate proceeding but recognizing that prejudice may be rebutted if there are no plausible grounds for relief). Specifically, the respondent has not established that filing an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s December 21, 2015, decision could change the result in his case. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s ultimate refusal to grant the respondent’s motion to reissue her prior ruling on the basis of the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is correct. See Siong v. INS, supra.
 
*2 For similar reasons, the Immigration Judge’s failure to grant sua sponte reissuance of her decision does not provide a proper basis for sustaining the respondent’s appeal. We therefore dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We note that the respondent has not sought reopening of his 2005 removal proceedings. There also is no indication in the record that these proceedings were consolidated with the 2000 proceedings.

2

In recounting this procedural history in her July 11, 2016, decision, the Immigration Judge made several factual errors. First, the Immigration Judge suggested that her December 21, 2015, decision ordered the respondent removed at the conclusion of proceedings (I.J. at 1-2). The decision, in fact, denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge also stated that the respondent appealed from her denial of his first motion to reissue (I.J. at 1-2). The respondent did not appeal; the respondent instead filed, with the Board, a motion to accept untimely appeal from the Immigration Judge’s December 21, 2015, denial of his motion to reopen. The Board denied this motion on April 27, 2016. The Board did not review the Immigration Judges’ denial of the first motion to reissue. Because the Immigration Judge’s factual errors do not affect the outcome of our decision, however, remand is not required.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Erika I. Goncalves, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 10, 2015. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in not reopening his removal proceedings sua sponte and then administratively closing proceedings, in order that he may seek a provisional unlawful presence waiver and pursue consular processing.1 Upon de novo review, we conclude that the respondent has not established that sua sponte reopening of his proceedings is warranted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). We recognize that, among other equities, the respondent is the beneficiary of an approved visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife. He has a United States citizen child, as well as two stepchildren. We also acknowledge the respondent’s assertion that he failed to appear at his 2006 removal hearing due to the misadvice of an immigration attorney.
 
However, upon consideration of the record as a whole, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has presented insufficient evidence of circumstances that would justify a discretionary grant of his untimely motion to reopen and the extraordinary remedy of reopening his removal proceedings sua sponte. See, e.g.. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (sua sponte reopening is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations); INS v. Rios-Pineda, 471 U.S. 444, 450-51 (1985) (finding that equities which are obtained after the entry of a final deportation order do not create substantial equities). The respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear containing the date and time of his scheduled hearing. Insofar as the respondent asserts that his failure to appear was due to ineffective assistance of counsel, he did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that he hired an attorney or that she filed any application on his behalf. Nor did the respondent comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Finally, we decline the respondent’s request to reopen and administratively close these proceedings. See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alexander Y. Chan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s October 26, 2016, decision denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment - and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges - de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s finding that the motion is untimely, where the respondent was ordered removed on May 24, 2012, but did not file the instant motion to reopen until October 3, 2016. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (providing that a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the entry of a final administrative order of removal). We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not state any new facts to be proven and did not file any relief applications in conjunction with his motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). In addition, we agree with the Immigration Judge that, to the extent that the respondent was making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, he did not comply with the requirements for making such a claim pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Moreover, the record does not show a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002); see also Correa-Rivera v. Holder, 706 F.3d 1128, 1131 (9th Cir. 2013). In fact, the respondent, who was not represented during his removal hearings below, does not refer to any specific attorney in his motion; rather, he claims that he “‘received ineffective advice from another [unnamed] attorney that he not object to entry of his removal order so that he could be released from custody.” Under these circumstances, the respondent did not meet his burden for making such a claim.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
On January 22, 2016, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen based on a claimed violation of due process, including ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, now appeals. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings regarding witness credibility and what is likely to happen to the respondent, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Vitug v. Holder, 723 F.3d 1056, 1063 (9th Cir. 2013); Ridore v. Holder, 696 F.3d 907, 915-16 (9th Cir. 2012); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review all other issues, including questions of law, discretion, and judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On March 21, 2006, the respondent was convicted of aggravated assault in Arizona. A Notice to Appear was issued charging the respondent with being inadmissible under sections 212(a)(6)(A)(i) and 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. On August 24, 2006, an Immigration Judge in Eloy, Arizona, granted the respondent’s request for voluntary departure with an alternate order of removal to Mexico. At the time the respondent was represented by attorneys from Stender & Pope (I.J. at 2; Respondent’s Br at 3; Motion at 3).1
 
The respondent re-entered the United States on January 1, 2007. On June 30, 2009, the respondent was convicted of disorderly conduct in Arizona and was sentenced to 1 year of imprisonment. He was issued a Notice to Appear on January 11, 2010.
 
On February 3, 2010, before an Immigration Judge in Florence, Arizona, the respondent admitted the allegations set forth in the Notice to Appear, and conceded the charges of removability. The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent to be removed.
 
On December 30, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to reopen the 2006 voluntary departure order with the Immigration Court in Florence (I.J. at 2; Respondent’s Br. at 3; Motion at 3). The respondent asserts that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel during the 2006 proceedings, because his prior attorney failed to discover the existence of a visa petition that was filed in 1998 by his lawful permanent resident father and approved on October 9, 2002. The respondent also asserts that the government had an obligation to inform him and his father of the visa petition’s approval, but failed to do so. He argues that, at the time of the 2006 proceedings, the approved and then-current visa petition would have provided an opportunity for him to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act as the “child” (at that time) of a lawful permanent resident, in conjunction with a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act. Thus, he asserts that his 2006 decision to accept voluntary departure and waive his appeal rights was not considered and intelligent because his prior counsel and the government did not make him aware of his eligibility for relief (Respondent’s Br. at 6-7, 8, 9-10; Motion at 6-7, 8, 9-10; Attached Exh. K).
 
*2 The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen the 2006 voluntary departure order, because he determined that the motion was not properly before him. The Immigration Judge, citing regulations, determined that the motion should have been filed with the Eloy Immigration Court because that court had created the record of proceedings for the 2006 order and, thus, had administrative control over the record of proceedings (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23; see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(a) (providing that all documents and applications that are to be considered in a proceeding before an Immigration Judge must be filed with the Immigration Court having administrative control over the record of proceedings).
 
The respondent also argues that he has substantially complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (Respondent’s Br. at 11; Motion at 11). Further, the respondent argues that the proceedings in 2010 violated due process because the 2006 proceedings were invalid and because a knowing and voluntary waiver of rights was not obtained. He contends that either the general deadline for seeking reopening should be equitably tolled or proceedings should be reopened sua sponte.
 
Even if the Immigration Judge incorrectly determined that the motion to reopen the 2006 voluntary departure order was not properly before him, the respondent did not demonstrate prejudice for purposes of his due process violation claim, specifically regarding his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, we will affirm the decision to deny the motion to reopen.
 
As stated, the respondent contends that he was not aware of his father’s approved visa petition when he accepted pre-conclusion voluntary departure in 2006. Our review of the 2006 record reflects that there was no discussion of the 2002 approved petition by either party.
 
Nonetheless, we are not persuaded that the respondent’s acceptance of pre-conclusion voluntary departure was not considered and intelligent. The record reflects that the respondent knew about the approved petition filed by his mother; indeed, it was admitted into the record as Exhibit 2. Yet, at the hearing on August 24, 2006, the respondent’s prior counsel informed the Immigration Judge that the parties agreed to pre-conclusion voluntary departure (Tr. dated August 24, 2006, at 33). The respondent informed the Immigration Judge that he accepted the voluntary departure order and waived appeal (DHS Br. in Opposition to Motion to Reopen at 1-3; Tr. dated August 24, 2006, at 34-35). Thus, the record reflects that the respondent’s acceptance of pre-conclusion voluntary departure was considered and intelligent, and his waiver of appeal rights was knowing and voluntary.
 
Based on this information, we conclude that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel or prejudice. It appears from the record that the respondent’s decision to accept pre-conclusion voluntary departure was strategic. As the beneficiary of his mother’s approved visa petition, the respondent could have applied for an immigrant visa from the United States consulate in Mexico. Thus, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion to reopen the 2006 voluntary departure order.
 
*3 We next address the Immigration Judge’s denial of the aspect of the motion to reopen relating to the validity of the 2010 proceedings. The Immigration Judge assumed for purposes of analysis that the 2010 proceedings violated the respondent’s due process rights, but ultimately concluded that reopening was not warranted because the respondent was not eligible for the relief sought. Specifically, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent re-entered the United States after his 2006 voluntary departure, had accrued 1 year of unlawful presence before the voluntary departure,2 and was “““seeking admission” via the adjustment of status application. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent therefore was inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the Act, and thus, was not eligible for the relief sought, i.e., adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act (I.J. at 3).
 
We held in Matter of Lemus-Losa, 25 I&N Dec. 734 (BIA 2012), that adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act is unavailable to an alien who is inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the Act, absent a waiver. See id. at 734, 744-45. The respondent did not request a waiver under section 212(a)(9)(B)(v) of the Act in conjunction with his motion to reopen. Indeed, the respondent did not address on appeal the Immigration Judge’s determination that he was inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the Act, and thus, was not eligible for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act. We discern no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion to reopen with respect to the 2010 removal order.
 
Finally, inasmuch as the respondent did not apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(B)(v) of the Act, and, is not otherwise eligible for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act based on his inadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the Act, there is no basis to reopen sua sponte either by the Immigration Judge or the Board (Respondent’s Br. at 16-17; Motion at 16-17).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Daniel W. Thomann, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Scott D. Criss
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondents, natives and citizens of Honduras, have filed an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 18, 2016, denying their request for a continuance and deeming their applications for relief abandoned. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a motion opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge properly concluded that the respondents failed to establish good cause for a continuance in their case (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). The Immigration Judge noted below that counsel made only a verbal request for a continuance with no supporting documentary evidence (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 20-22, 24).2 Compare Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009) (setting forth factors to consider when adjudicating a motion for a continuance based on a pending visa petition, noting that focus should be on ultimate likelihood of success on adjustment application). On appeal, counsel argues that the respondents were denied due process. However, to date counsel has still not submitted evidence that he timely mailed the respondents’ asylum application (Form I-589) to the court, and it is not contained in the record before us. We conclude that the respondents have failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing any claims to relief. See Matter of Sibrun, supra, at 356.
 
The denial of a continuance will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing, and here the respondents have not shown such (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 1-25). See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987). Furthermore, the respondents have failed to show prejudice. See Matter of Sibrun, supra, at 356-58. As noted above, to date they have not shown the pendency of any applications for relief. Id. Finally, we are not persuaded that sua sponte reopening would be appropriate in this case, where they have failed to establish due diligence in pursuing relief from removal. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (party seeking reopening bears heavy burden); see also Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (requirements for filing motion to reopen based on claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
*2 We also agree with the Immigration Judge deeming all applications for relief abandoned (I.J. at 2). A potential applicant must file all application forms on or before a filing deadline set by the Immigration Court. See Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). The respondents were represented by the same attorney below and on appeal, who was informed of the filing deadline of July 18, 2016 on the record (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 17). To date, counsel for the respondents has not proffered a complete Form I-589 or supporting documents, and has not submitted evidence that the application was timely filed.3
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Aaron Chenault, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s August 8, 2016, decision denying her motion to reopen her removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the appeal, which will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear (NTA) was served personally on the respondent on January 22, 2016 (Exh. 1). At a hearing on February 29, 2016, the Immigration Judge informed the respondent and her attorney that her failure to appear for her next scheduled hearing and to meet the filing deadline for her application for relief would result in an order of removal (I.J. at 2). On March 8, 2016, the respondent filed a motion for a change of venue. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion and specifically noted that the application for relief was still due by March 10, 2016. Id. As the respondent did not appear for her hearing on March 10, 2016, and did not file an application for relief, the Immigration Judge ordered that all claims for relief were deemed abandoned and ordered the respondent removed. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c).
 
On July 26, 2016, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The respondent argued that exceptional circumstances caused her failure to appear for her hearing, as she did not believe she was required to appear for it or that she was required to submit her application by that date due to her release from immigration custody (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had not demonstrated that exceptional circumstances caused her to miss her filing deadline and that the record did not warrant sua sponte reopening (I.J. at 3).1
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. A failure to request relief in accordance with a schedule set by the Immigration Judge constitutes a waiver of the opportunity to file for such relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (stating that if an application is not filed within the time limit set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application shall be deemed abandoned). The Board has long held that applications for benefits under the Act are properly denied as abandoned when the alien fails to timely file them. See Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992); Matter of Jean, 17 I&N Dec. 100, 102 (BIA 1979).
 
*2 The administrative record reflects that the Immigration Judge informed both the respondent and her attorney that she must file the application for relief by her next hearing on March 10, 2016, or her application for relief would be deemed abandoned and she would be ordered removed (I.J. at 2). See Respondent’s Motion to Change Venue at 1. The respondent and her attorney did not file any applications for relief by the filing deadline. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge properly determined that the respondent’s claims for relief were deemed abandoned.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent and her counsel’s “““purported ignorance” do not warrant reopening of her proceedings (I.J. at 2). The respondent argued that her counsel’s clerk informed her that she did not need to appear for her March 10, 2016, hearing, and that she was unaware she was required to adhere to a filing deadline. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2-3. The respondent’s counsel argued that he understood the Immigration Judge’s instructions to mean that the respondent must adhere to the filing deadline if she were still detained and on the detained docket. Id. at 6.
 
An attorney’s administrative error is not a basis for reopening absent compliance with the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998); see also Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647-48 (5th Cir. 2014) (making mandatory strict compliance with the Lozada requirements and emphasizing that former counsel must be informed of the allegations against them before the allegations are presented in a brief to the Board). The respondent has not established ineffective assistance of counsel for her failure to timely file her applications for relief. The respondent has not submitted an affidavit setting forth the facts and her agreement with her counsel, nor has she provided any evidence that her counsel has been made aware of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond, either after or before she filed her brief to the Board, nor did she indicate that a disciplinary complaint had been filed against that attorney. See Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, supra, at 647. Thus, reopening is not warranted in this matter, as the respondent has not complied with the requirements set forth in Lozada. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In his decision dated March 10, 2016, the Immigration Judge did not issue an in absentia order of removal. As the Immigration Judge did not actually order the respondent removed in absentia, the respondent’s motion to reopen on the basis of exceptional circumstances for failure to appear is inapplicable. Moreover, in a deportation case pursuant to section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that where an alien failed to appear for a hearing and the Immigration Judge issued an order stating that all claims for relief were deemed abandoned, the hearing was not held in absentia. See Williams-Igwonobe v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 453 (5th Cir. 2006).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Suraj R. Singh, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rod Wolthoff
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s May 26, 2016, decision denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings after the issuance of an in absentia order of removal. The respondent’s appeal, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security, will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear (NTA) was served personally on the respondent on February 16, 2016 (Exh. 1). A Notice of Hearing (NOH) dated March 11, 2016, was sent to the respondent’s former counsel scheduling a hearing for April 6, 2016. As the respondent did not appear for his hearing on April 6, 2016, the Immigration Judge ordered him removed in absentia.
 
On May 9, 2016, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, alleging lack of notice of his April 6, 2016, hearing. The respondent claimed that he did not receive an NOH and that his prior attorney told him that his case would automatically change venue from Harlingen, Texas, to New York, New York, upon the respondent’s release from immigration custody (I.J. at unnumbered 1). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent received constructive notice of the hearing, as the record showed that the Immigration Court mailed the respondent’s prior attorney an NOH informing him of his April 6, 2016, hearing. Id.
 
The respondent filed his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision on July 19, 2016. On appeal, through new counsel, the respondent admits that he was aware of his scheduled hearing date of April 6, 2016, but asserts that the Immigration Judge did not properly consider his claim that his former counsel gave him wrong advice not to appear for that hearing. See Respondent’s Brief at unnumbered 3-4. In addition, the respondent alleges that his prior attorney’s misleading advice constituted exceptional circumstances that caused his failure to appear. See Respondent’s Brief at unnumbered 4.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. As the respondent’s attorney received notice of the hearing, we agree with the Immigration Judge that proper notice was provided to the respondent. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). The respondent did not establish that he failed to appear for the hearing due to “““exceptional circumstances,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). The Board has held that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the respondent of his responsibility to appear, and unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988); Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 1985), aff’d, Patel v. INS, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986).
 
*2 We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “““exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996).
 
An attorney’s administrative error or his failure to advise a client that a change of venue motion had not been granted and that he must appear for the hearing is not a basis for reopening absent compliance with Lozada; see also Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647-48 (5th Cir. 2014) (making mandatory strict compliance with the Lozada requirements and emphasizing that former counsel must be informed of the allegations against them before the allegations are presented in a brief to the Board). We are not persuaded by the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge erred in not properly considering his claim of ineffective assistance concerning his former counsel. The respondent has not established ineffective assistance of counsel for his failure to appear. The respondent has not submitted an affidavit describing the facts and his agreement with his former counsel, nor has he provided any evidence that his former counsel has been made aware of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond, either after or before he filed his brief to the Board, nor did he indicate that a disciplinary complaint had been filed against his prior attorney. See id. Thus, reopening is not warranted in this matter, as the respondent has made no attempt to comply with the requirements set forth in Lozada. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

IN RE: CHRISTIANH OLUBUNMI SUTTON
File: AXXX XX1 670 - Las Vegas, NV
January 30, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
J. Oscar Shaw, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Petition to remove conditional basis of permanent residence
 
*1 This case is before us pursuant to an order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dated August 2, 2016, which denied the petition for review in part but remanded for the Board “to address [the petitioner’s] contention that her former attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to pursue a hardship waiver.” We will again dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
In our decision dated October 10, 2014, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent relief from removal. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was not credible and that she had not provided sufficient evidence to meet her burden of establishing that she entered into a “““good faith marriage” for purposes of a waiver under section 216(c)(4)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B) (I.J. at 2-4). The Ninth Circuit dismissed the petition for review insofar as it challenged those findings. However, the Ninth Circuit remanded on the issue of whether the respondent’s prior counsel provided ineffective assistance because she did not file for a hardship waiver under section 216(c)(4)(A) of the Act.
 
We conclude that the respondent did not establish that her former counsel provided ineffective assistance. Even assuming that failure to file an application for a waiver before the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services could constitute ineffective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings, the respondent has not presented evidence that she substantially complied with the procedural requirements for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); United States v. Lopez-Chavez, 757 F.3d 1033, 1044 (9th Cir. 2014); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 213 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). The respondent’s mere assertion of what action her former counsel should have taken is not sufficient to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel. Id.
 
*2 Additionally, the respondent has not demonstrated that she suffered any prejudice as a result of the purported ineffective assistance of her former counsel. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that despite a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel, prejudice had not been demonstrated and relief was correctly denied); United States v. Lopez-Chavez, supra, at 1043 (explaining that it is not only necessary to demonstrate that counsel’s ineffective assistance rendered proceedings unfair, but also that such deficient performance resulted in prejudice). She did not provide any evidence to demonstrate that she was eligible for and had a reasonable likelihood of receiving the waiver. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, supra, at 827 (explaining that it is necessary to establish both eligibility for relief and a plausibility that relief could have been granted to substantiate a finding of prejudice).
 
The respondent represented that she would file the waiver application and associated receipt with the Board with a motion to remand (Respondent’s Brief at 16). In our prior decision, we noted that we had not received any supplemental filings and to date we have not received evidence that such a waiver application was filed (BIA Dec. dated Oct. 10, 2014, at 3 n.1). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Richard Wenfeng Chen, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)] - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document (lead respondent)
 
Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled (co-respondents)
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondents have appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated February 5, 2016, denying their motion to reopen the proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against them on May 4, 2015. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including any determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On January 1, 2015, the respondents were personally served with Notices to Appear (Exhs. 1, 1A, 1B, 1C; I.J. at 1-2). On April 21, 2015, a hearing notice was mailed to the respondents at the address provided by them informing them of a hearing scheduled for May 4, 2015 (Exh. 2; I.J. at 2). The respondents received proper notice of their removal hearing. Section 239(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a).
 
On December 31, 2015, the respondents filed a motion to reopen and rescind the order of removal based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The two adult respondents assert in their affidavits that former counsel had told them they did not have to attend the hearing scheduled for May 4, 2015, in Seattle, Washington, because a motion to change venue to New York would be granted. They state that on October 12, 2015, they learned from current counsel that a removal order had been entered against them five months earlier.
 
An in absentia order of removal may be rescinded if, within 180 days, the alien files a motion to reopen that demonstrates that his or her absence was due to “exceptional circumstances.” Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Ineffective assistance of counsel qualifies as an exceptional circumstance warranting rescission of an in absentia order of removal. Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 596 (9th Cir. 2004); Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 936-37 (9th Cir. 2003). Additionally, the 180-day filing deadline may be equitably tolled when an attorney’s fraudulent or ineffective performance “caus[ed] an essential action in her client’s case to be undertaken ineffectively, out of time, or not at all.” Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). The party invoking equitable tolling must exercise due diligence in “obtain[ing] vital information bearing on the existence of the claim.” Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001).
 
*2 Before making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien generally must comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Those requirements are as follows: (1) the alien should submit an affidavit detailing the agreement with former counsel; (2) the alien must notify former counsel of the allegations and afford counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) the motion should reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. These requirements “are not rigidly applied, especially when the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002). Here, the respondents’ claims that former counsel told them they did not have to appear at the May 4, 2015 hearing and did not inform them of the removal order entered against them are not clear and obvious from the record. Therefore, they must comply with the Lozada requirements for making a claim to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondents complied with the third Lozada requirement but did not comply with the first and second. With respect to the first Lozada requirement, the Immigration Judge stated that the respondents’ affidavits are not reflective of their own thoughts because they are nearly identical and, although they are bolstered by a cover page indicating a motion to change venue filed by their former counsel was rejected, two receipts are weaker evidence because they don’t identify the attorney’s name and are consecutively numbered despite being issued 11 days apart (I.J. at 3-4; Motion at Tabs A, B, and C). We disagree as the affidavits submitted by the respondents establish their compliance with the first Lozada requirement. The fact that the affidavits are nearly identical is neither surprising nor indicative of a lack of veracity where the respondents are a married couple who were placed in consolidated removal proceedings together, they have been represented at all times by the same attorneys, they are relying on the same set of facts, and the affidavits were prepared with the assistance of current counsel. The affidavits detailing the respondents agreement with, and interactions with, former counsel satisfy the first Lozada requirement.
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondents did not satisfy the second Lozada requirement because their notification to former counsel of the filing of a complaint suggested that she should “forward all [of her] response [s] to the [Departmental Disciplinary] Committee, if any,” rather than with the Immigration Court. We agree with the Immigration Judge that this suggestion is in error, as the purpose of the second requirement is to prevent abusive practices before the Immigration Court by allowing the attorney “whose integrity or competence is being impugned to present his version of events if he so chooses, thereby discouraging baseless allegations.” Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. However, because the letter to the respondents’ former counsel specified that the complaint was filed pursuant to Matter of Lozada, she was sufficiently informed that the complaint was filed in connection with the respondent’s removal proceedings and could have filed a response with the Immigration Court if she so desired. Accordingly, the respondents complied with the second Lozada requirement.
 
*3 As we noted earlier, the Immigration Judge found that the respondents had complied with the third Lozada requirement. Additionally, the allegations made by the respondents, which are supported by documentary evidence, establish that the respondents received ineffective assistance from their former counsel. Because the respondents’ motion for rescission of the in absentia removal order is grounded on ineffective assistance of counsel, a showing of prejudice is not required. Lo v. Ashcroft, supra, at 939 n.6. Additionally, the respondents acted with due diligence in pursuing their claim after finding out that an in absentia removal order had been entered against them. Therefore, equitable tolling of the 180-day period for filing the motion is warranted. Accordingly, the respondents’ appeal will be sustained, the motion will be granted, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and the motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: ROBERTO CHAPARRO-RODRIGUEZ
File: AXXX XX4 467 - Tucson, AZ
January 25, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher J. Slender, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Peter Gannon
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board’s decision entered on February 29, 2016, dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent filed the present untimely motion to reopen proceedings on October 19, 2016. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion.
 
In seeking untimely reopening, the motion claims ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of attorneys who represented him before the Immigration Judge. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held the time limit for filing a motion may be tolled and proceedings reopened when ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from reasonably presenting his case, and the alien is prejudiced. See Iturribarria v. I.N.S., 321 F.3d 889, 897-99 (9th Cir. 2003). In Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003), the court held that an alien failed to show prejudice when he could not “show that his admissibility arguments might have been successful on appeal to the BIA.” In Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004), the court explained that an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate that counsel’s performance was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1988) (explaining that a party who seeks to reopen proceedings before the Immigration Judge, with all the attendant delays, bears a “heavy burden” of proof that new evidence would likely change the result in his case).
 
The record in this matter shows that the respondent had a full and fair opportunity to present his case. The Immigration Judge at the hearing, and the Board on de novo review, considered all relevant factors, both positive and negative, regarding the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility. See Decision of the Board, Feb. 29, 2016, at 2-3; I.J. at 4-8. With the present motion, the respondent has submitted additional evidence of hardship to his United States citizen relatives, primarily concerning their health. See Mot., Tabs F-L. But the relatives’ health conditions were considered by the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 7), and the hardship together with the respondent’s other positive factors were determined not to outweigh his forgery offense involving a significant sum, lack of rehabilitation, and use of another’s identity documents for employment purposes. The additional evidence, even if it had been offered by counsel at the hearing, would not have led to a different weighing of the discretionary factors. The record indicates that the respondent’s counsel presented evidence of the positive factors and the motion does not demonstrate that counsel’s performance may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, supra.
 
*2 As the respondent has not established that counsel failed to offer evidence with which he might have been successful upon the Board’s de novo review on appeal, we conclude that ineffective assistance and prejudice are not established. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, supra; see also Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The motion to reopen does not demonstrate any “exceptional situation” that would warrant reopening these proceedings under the Board’s limited sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). The motion therefore will be denied as time-barred.1
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and the related request for a stay are denied.

The Board notes that the respondent is represented in this motion by the same attorney who represented him in the appeal. The motion does not explain why the claim of ineffective assistance was not raised in the appeal or otherwise in a timely manner.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: JORGE OLIVAREZ VALADEZ
File: AXXX XX7 318 - Los Angeles, CA
January 24, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alex Galvez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the June 2, 2016, decision of the Immigration Judge denying his request for a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for a continuance to pursue Consular processing and the filing of a waiver in conjunction with his approved I-130 visa petition filed by his citizen spouse. The Immigration Judge determined that the circumstances presented by the respondent, without more, failed to establish good cause for a continuance.
 
The decision whether to grant a continuance is committed to the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6. Thus, an Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance request will not be overturned on appeal unless the respondent establishes that the denial deprived him of his due process right to a full and fair hearing. See Matter of Luviano, 21 I&N Dec. 235, 237 (BIA 1996) (citing Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987)). The alien must show that actual prejudice materially affecting the outcome of the case resulted from the denial of the continuance. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983).
 
In this case, the Immigration Judge considered the relevant facts and circumstances presented and concluded that the respondent had approximately 18 months to present evidence that he filed an I-601A waiver, yet none was filed. On March 20, 2014, the Immigration Judge administratively closed proceedings in order to allow the respondent to pursue the I-601A waiver. However, on October 22, 2015, the Department of Homeland Security filed a motion to re-calendar the case noting that there was no indication that the I-601A had been filed. (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge reset the case for June 2, 2016, whereupon the respondent explained that no action had been taken because of financial and family problems. (Tr. at 43).
 
On this record, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s arguments on appeal that good cause was shown for a further continuance of proceedings. The respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge’s denial of his continuance request has compromised the fairness of his removal proceedings. Given the above facts, we find no good cause for the proceedings to have been continued any further.
 
To the extent the respondent contends that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel, beyond his assertions he has not “““substantially” complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Moreover, the record does not demonstrate that the respondent received constitutionally inadequate assistance of counsel that prejudiced his case. See Hernandez-Mendoza v. Gonzales, 537 F.3d 976, 978-79 (9th Cir. 2007). The respondent raises the speculative possibility that he may have been eligible for other forms of relief, but presents no evidence or argument to support this assertion (Resp. Br. at 8-9).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Brian J. Hoffman, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on August 17, 2016, when we dismissed the respondents’ appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 10, 2016, decision, in which he denied the respondents’ January 8, 2016, motion to reopen.1 This timely motion to reconsider followed. The respondents’ request for a waiver of the appellate filing fee is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). Their motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider requests review based on alleged errors of law or fact in a prior decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); see also Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 219 n.3 (5th Cir. 2008) (defining a motion to reconsider and distinguishing such a motion from a motion to reopen); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991) (same). To the extent that the respondents reiterate their arguments regarding (1) their compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); (2) equitable tolling; and (3) the Board’s authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings, we are unpersuaded that the restatement of these arguments qualify as identified errors of law or fact in our prior decision. However, to the extent that the respondents raise new arguments identifying such alleged errors, we are unpersuaded that any errors exist for the reasons outlined below (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 4-20).
 
Starting with compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in our precedent for claims involving ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondents urge us to adopt a test for motions filed before an Immigration Judge distinct from the test employed in Matter of Lozada, supra, and applied to a motion filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals in that specific case (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 6-14). See id. at 639. In this regard, the respondents specifically maintain that the requirement “““that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond” should be relaxed when a motion to reopen is filed before an Immigration Court, as Matter of Lozada, supra, did not involve this specific factual scenario (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 6-14). In the alternative, they argue that notice alone to prior counsel should be sufficient because to require otherwise would gut a respondent’s ability to timely file a motion before the Immigration Court or otherwise demonstrate due diligence (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 11-13).
 
*2 We are unpersuaded that an attorney’s opportunity to respond where the attorney is being accused of ineffective assistance is less important when a motion is filed directly with the Immigration Court than it is where jurisdiction over the motion lies with this Board. Moreover, imposing such a requirement does not, as the respondents suggest, force the respondents to wait indefinitely for a response from former counsel (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 8-10). It only requires that former counsel be furnished an opportunity to respond, and does not require a respondent to wait until an actual response is forthcoming. Accordingly, we thus conclude that our prior decision--following the specific language outlining procedural compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra--is not in error. See also Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 648 (5th Cir. 2014).
 
Nor are we persuaded that the respondents presented a sufficient basis for not strictly complying with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, for purposes of evaluating their ineffective assistance claim (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 11-13). Instead, as we noted in our August 17, 2016, order, the lead respondent has not made clear what steps she took (and when she took such steps) in discovering the ineffective assistance alleged. As a result, we do not agree with the respondents’ assertion that the lead respondent demonstrated an adequate basis for not providing notice and an opportunity to respond for the respondents’ former counsel prior to filing their motion to reopen. In light of the foregoing, we again conclude that it is unnecessary to reach the substance of the respondents’ ineffective assistance claim, inasmuch as they maintain that the attorney’s deficient performance contributed to a notice problem and the respondents’ non-appearance at their final scheduled hearing (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 13-14).
 
Turning to the issue of equitable tolling, we acknowledge that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this case arises, clarified its stance on this concept during the pendency of the respondents’ original appeal (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 14-17). See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337 (5th Cir. 2016) (explicitly explaining that the concept of equitable tolling is available within the Fifth Circuit and applies to the 90-day deadline generally applicable to motions to reopen in immigration proceedings). However, we conclude that the publication of Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, supra, and the fact that we did not cite to or apply it in our August 17, 2016, decision does not alter the outcome in these proceedings.
 
*3 In this regard, the respondents assert in their motion to reconsider that we overlooked their appellate arguments on this topic, but this is a mischaracterization of our decision (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 16-17). First, our decision noted that the respondents did not raise this issue before the Immigration Judge. The decision not to raise the issue was significant, as that is a basis for finding a waiver of the issue on appeal. See Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 261 n.1 (BIA 2007). However, in considering the issue raised for the first time on appeal here, and assuming the availability of equitable tolling within the Fifth Circuit, we concluded that the respondents did not persuasively establish that they benefit from such tolling. Accordingly, we conclude that Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, supra, does not alter the analysis in our August 17, 2016, decision. Nor does the absence of a citation to that decision demonstrate an error of law therein.
 
Finally, to the extent that the respondents maintain that we erred in declining to independently exercise our authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte (as opposed to reversing the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny sua sponte reopening), we are unpersuaded by their argument that the regulations accorded us such authority in the context of our August 17, 2016, decision (Respondents’ Motion to Reconsider at 20). However, notwithstanding the jurisdictional challenge, we independently determined that sua sponte reopening was not warranted in this case when reviewing the Immigration Judge’s decision. Because we concluded de novo that no exceptional circumstances exist, we agreed with the Immigration Judge that sua sponte reopening was not warranted.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ motion to reconsider is denied.

IN RE: KAZI ABUL HASAN
File: AXXX XX9 522 - New York, NY
January 10, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Russell W. Hasan, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)] - Controlled substance violation
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s January 6, 2016, decision denying his request for a continuance and ordering him removed from the United States to Bangladesh. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including determinations as to credibility and the likelihood of future events, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Hui Lin Huang v. Holder, 677 F.3d 130 (2d Cir. 2012); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review all other issues under a de novo standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that the Immigration Judge should have realized that his prior attorney was “a sub-standard immigration lawyer” because he filed the wrong form to seek a waiver of inadmissibility in March 2012, and suggests that she should have granted a continuance due to “hints of facts on the record for satisfying both 212(h) and 212(c) such that an Immigration Judge should be curious to see what evidence [the] respondent could introduce if given a further opportunity to do so” (Respondent’s Brief at 13-14).
 
As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent has been in removal proceedings for more than 5 years, and has not submitted a valid application or evidence establishing his eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility under either section 212(c) or section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”) (I.J. at 1-3). Absent a showing of a readily available form of relief from removal, the Immigration Judge acted properly in ordering the respondent’s removal from the United States. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505 (BIA 1980) (noting that once the DHS institutes proceedings, an Immigration Judge must order an alien deported if the evidence supports the charge). Based on the foregoing, we find that the respondent has not established good cause for a continuance. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987) (the decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown, and that decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing). Moreover, the respondent has not shown that he was denied a fair hearing.
 
*2 During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand the record for further proceedings based upon his claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Brief at 7-13). Specifically, the respondent notes that his former attorney failed to file the appropriate form to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility in March 2012, and never corrected this mistake by filing a valid application along with supporting evidence and a copy of the filing fee receipt (Respondent’s Brief at 7-13).
 
In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we held that a motion to reopen based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. While the respondent submitted an affidavit setting forth his agreement with his former counsel, he provided no evidence that he notified his prior counsel of the specific allegations leveled against him or filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Consequently, the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. See Zheng v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 409 F.3d 43 (2d Cir. 2005). Moreover, the respondent has offered no evidence that he would have prevailed if his prior attorney had been more effective in his representation or had filed a valid Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility (Form I-601). Therefore, we conclude that the respondent has not demonstrated that he suffered any prejudice due to his former counsel’s actions or inactions. See Romero v. United States INS, 399 F.3d 109, 112 (2d Cir. 2005), citing United States v. Perez, 330 F.3d 97, 101 (2d Cir. 2001).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

File: AXXX XX9 959 - New Orleans, LA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jack E. Wallace, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Charlotte S. Marquez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 19, 2015, denying her motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order dated February 8, 1999. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing or was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien.1 Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 723 (BIA 1999). Exceptional circumstances include serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of an immediate relative of the alien, but not less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion was untimely, as it was not filed within 180 days of the in absentia order, and that the respondent did not establish that she acted with due diligence so as to warrant equitable tolling of the filing deadline (I.J. at 3-4). See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 343-44 (5th Cir. 2016) (requiring that an alien seeking equitable tolling show that she has been pursuing her rights diligently). The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed on October 30, 2015, more than 15 years after she was ordered removed. Moreover, although the respondent asserts that she diligently pursued her rights because she has maintained temporary protected status since 1999, the record reflects that the respondent waited approximately 6 years to file her motion to reopen after learning that she had been ordered removed in absentia, which demonstrates a lack of diligence in pursuing her rights (I.J. at 4; Motion to Reopen, Tab E). To the extent the respondent asserts that the actions of her former attorney prevented her from filing the motion sooner, she has not complied with the procedural requirements for setting forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006). Upon review, we agree that the motion was untimely and that equitable tolling of the time limit was unwarranted.
 
*2 The respondent also did not establish that exceptional circumstances prevented her appearance at her hearing. See Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33 (BIA 1998) (stating that the Board applies a totality of the circumstances test for determining whether exceptional circumstances prevented an alien’s appearance at a hearing). Considering the totality of the circumstances, including respondent’s claim that she was only in the United States for a few months before her hearing, that she had limited notice of the hearing date, and that she had difficulty obtaining transportation, we agree with the Immigration Judge that she did not demonstrate that her failure to appear at her hearing was because of “exceptional circumstances,” as contemplated in the Act (I.J. at 4).
 
Finally, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s claim that the Immigration Judge erred in declining to reopen proceedings sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent has not provided evidence of circumstances that would justify the extraordinary remedy of reopening her removal proceedings sua sponte. See, e.g., Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (holding that discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that sua sponte reopening is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
In light of the foregoing, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed. The following order will be entered.

IN RE: NORMA MURILLO RODRIGUEZ
File: AXXX XX6 150 - El Paso, TX
December 30, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Amber Weeks, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael Pleters
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 On August 31, 2016, the respondent submitted a “motion to reopen and reconsider” in proceedings in which the Board dismissed her appeal on August 26, 2014. The Board also granted a motion to reopen on January 9, 2015, for the limited purpose of reinstating voluntary departure. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the respondent’s current motion. The motion will be denied.
 
Whether treated as a motion to reopen or one seeking reconsideration, the respondent’s motion is untimely filed, and as a motion to reopen it is also number-barred. Sections 240(c)(6), (7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6), (7); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(b), (c)(2). The respondent, however, asks that the Board exercise its sua sponte authority, also citing Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337(5th Cir. 2016) as supporting equitable tolling of the statutory time limitation.
 
As the respondent essentially concedes, a significant amount of the information in her motion was available, and could have been, but was not, presented at the time of her hearing. The respondent repeatedly states that this error on the part of her former counsel, Ms. Kretz, did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel, although she also describes her representation as “inadequate [and] lukewarm” (Motion at 2, 22). The respondent has not otherwise identified any extraordinary circumstances which prevented the timely filing of her motion. Rather, she alleges numerous errors on Ms. Kretz’s part in support of her motion (Motion at 22-25). The respondent also asserts that the Immigration Judge committed various errors in adjudicating her claim, none of which were addressed by prior counsel either during the proceedings below, or in a timely motion to reconsider (Motion at 25-30).
 
Given this record, the basis for the equitable tolling sought by the respondent is, in fact, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, she has not complied with any of the requirements for such a claim. Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644 (5th Cir. 2014); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In addition, as she has not shown that this evidence was previously unavailable and could not have been presented at her hearing, it is also not new for purposes of reopening. INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). The respondent’s choice to not comply with the requirements for reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not an exceptional situation supporting either sua sponte reopening or reconsideration. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (“As a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Therefore, we find that neither reopening nor reconsideration in this regard is warranted.
 
*2 The respondent also seeks to introduce evidence that post-dates her hearing relating to medical treatment for herself, her brother and mother, and evidence that her daughter was granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, among other evidence (Motion, Tabs O-AA). However, the acquisition of equities, both positive and negative, following an order of removal is a typical, rather than exceptional, situation. Id. In this regard we note that the mother’s most recent medical records indicate that her medical conditions were chronic, and there is no evidence that they first manifested after the respondent’s hearing (Motion, Tab O). These records also reflect that the respondent’s mother was no longer experiencing anxiety related to her brother’s death in March of 2016, and that her chronic conditions were either asymptomatic or controlled with medication. The respondent’s brother’s medical issues also predated her hearing (Motion, Tabs R, S).
 
We are not unsympathetic to any worsening of the respondent’s brother’s medical issues, and recognize the medical issues faced by the respondent. However, as noted, such issues are not uncommon when a respondent remains in the United States following an order of removal. Moreover, we note that neither the respondent nor her mother or brother have mentioned what assistance other family members could provide if she was removed to Mexico. (Motion, pgs. 131 (mentioning the respondent’s “sisters and their families”), 132-34 (letters from family members referencing multiple nieces and nephews)). As we find that the respondent has not shown an exceptional situation in this regard, we decline to exercise our authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings. Id.; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
In sum, the respondent has not demonstrated that her motion is, or should be, exempt from the noted statutory bars. As such, we find that neither reopening nor reconsideration is warranted.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: CHRISTIAN RODRIGUEZ
File: AXXX XX0 226 - Hartford, CT
December 28, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Muneer Ahmad, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This proceeding was last before the Board on October 20, 2015, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal.1 On September 26, 2016, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c) 97); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent does not contend that a statutory or regulatory exception to the time bar applies. Id. Nor does the respondent contend that the time limitation should be equitably tolled based on ineffective assistance of counsel.2
 
Rather, the respondent seeks either sua sponte reopening and administrative closure or sua sponte reopening and a remand for consideration of administrative closure or a continuance pending adjudication of his application for a U visa. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). We decline to exercise our sua sponte discretionary authority to reopen proceedings because the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances justifying the exercise of our sua sponte authority.
 
These proceedings need not be reopened for the respondent to pursue this application. The regulations provide exclusive jurisdiction over such applications to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and specifically address applications by U visa “petitioners” under final orders of removal, as is the case here. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1). The filing of the application has no effect on the Government’s authority to execute a final order, but a petitioner “may file a request for stay of removal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a) and 8 C.F.R. § 1241.6(a).” See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1)(ii). The respondent does not assert that the DHS is seeking his removal while his application is pending or that he has found it necessary to file a request for a stay of removal.
 
We have considered the respondent’s arguments about conserving judicial resources. In addition, we have considered the additional administrative resources that may be expended if we grant reopening but the respondent’s U visa is not granted by USCIS, as well as the additional judicial resources that may be expended if the respondent then decides to again pursue his petition for review with the Second Circuit, or files another petition for review. Weighing these factors, we find that there is no guarantee that judicial resources will be conserved, and that there may be additional expenditures related to additional administrative resources and judicial resources if this motion is granted. As such, conserving judicial resources is not a discretionary factor weighing in the respondent’s favor.
 
*2 The respondent relies on several unpublished Board decisions, but these decisions are not binding precedent. Further, each decision rests on its own facts and the records of proceedings, including the specific factual scenarios, of these unpublished decisions are not available for review. Moreover, the unpublished decisions on which the respondent relies involved timely motions (Motion, Exhs. G-H), had nothing to do with a U visa (Motion, Exh. I), or involved consideration of whether to reopen an in absentia order of removal issued against an unaccompanied minor (Motion, Exh. J).
 
The respondent’s reliance on Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807 (BIA 2012), is misplaced. In Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, the respondent requested a continuance during his merits hearing before the Immigration Judge because his U visa petition was still pending. Here, in contrast, the respondent did not seek a continuance until September 26, 2016, when he filed his untimely motion to reopen almost one year after the Board issued its final administrative order of removal. As such, Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, supra, does not apply.3
 
Considering the governing provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 214.14, the regulatory scheme addressing aliens with final orders who are pursuing U visas, and the circumstances presented in this case, we decline to exercise our discretionary sua sponte authority to reopen this proceeding. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied. The following order will be issued.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

The documents attached to the motion indicate that the respondent was a crime victim in 2011, that the respondent assisted in the criminal investigation soon thereafter, and that the criminal pled guilty in 2012. He does not explain why he waited until 2015 to obtain certification from the police and then file his U visa petition and related applications with USCIS. Nor does he explain why he waited over one year after submitting the U visa petition to file this current motion to reopen with the Board.

As noted in footnote 2, supra, the respondent does not explain the delay in filing this motion to reopen, or why he waited so long after the conviction and his victimization to obtain the required law enforcement certification or to pursue a U visa petition. The respondent does not claim that his attorneys provided ineffective assistance of counsel as to this delay. Nor has the respondent complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), or demonstrated due diligence in pursuing his U visa claim.

File: AXXX XX1 852 - Los Fresnos, TX
December 19, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Olivieri Gonzalez, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen; remand
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s July 21, 2016, decision denying his untimely motion to reopen his proceedings. During the pendency of his appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
The record reflects that the respondent was ordered removed on July 14, 2000, by an Immigration Judge (I.J. at 1). The respondent waived appeal (I.J. at 1). On June 29, 2016, approximately 16 years later, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge setting forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his attorney during his prior proceedings and arguing that the motions deadline for his motion to reopen should be equitably tolled (I.J. at 1-2). In particular, the respondent argued that, during his prior proceedings, his former attorney did not advise him of his eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), and failed to apply for said relief on his behalf. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposed the motion (I.J. at 1-2).
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion as untimely (I.J. at 1). Specifically, the Immigration Judge found the respondent did not meet his burden in establishing an exception to the 90-day regulatory motions deadline applicable to his motion (I.J. at 1). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(4)(i)-(iv). In regard to the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Immigration Judge found the respondent did not show he exercised due diligence during the interstitial period after the motions deadline had passed, as required for equitable tolling to apply (I.J. at 1-2).
 
On appeal and through his motion to remand, the respondent argues his motion is subject to equitable tolling in light of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337 (5th Cir. 2016). See Respondent’s Brief and Motion at 7-10. According to the respondent, under Lugo-Resendez, he established that he exercised due diligence because he “has been pursuing his rights diligently.” See id. at 9. The respondent claims he could not timely file the motion to reopen because he relied on his prior attorney’s “defective” assurances that he did not qualify for any relief from removal. See id. The respondent further argues that his case presents “exceptional circumstances” such that he can invoke equitable tolling. See id. at 9-12. In this regard, the respondent contends that his prior attorney was not competent, neglected her duties, and “emphatically” failed to identify or apply for relief for which he qualified. See id. at 10. The respondent argues that her “mishandling” of his case resulted in a denial of due process and that this amounts to “exceptional circumstances” justifying the reopening of his case. See id. at 11.
 
*2 There is no dispute the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely inasmuch as it was filed approximately 16 years after the regulatory due date (I.J. at 1). Further, there is no dispute that the respondent complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for purposes of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 1). Given the totality of the circumstances in this case, including the respondent’s lengthy residence in the United States, most of which was spent as a lawful permanent resident; his United States citizen wife and mother who both suffer from health problems; his United States citizen children, one with autism; and, his employment history, coupled with his Lozada compliance, we find that reopening is warranted. See Respondent’s Brief at 12.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michelle Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michele Drucker
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the October 14, 2015, decision of an Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent was personally served with a Notice to Appear (NTA) on March 14, 2006, which included notice of a January 11, 2007, hearing; a subsequent notice of hearing (NOH) for a June 6, 2007, hearing was mailed on March 8, 2007, to the respondent at the Florida address she provided and which is contained in the NTA, but the NOH was returned as undeliverable marked “““unclaimed, unable to forward” (I.J. at 1-2; Exhs. 1, 2). The respondent failed to appear at her June 6, 2007, hearing, and an in absentia order was properly entered against her.
 
Written notice is considered sufficient if provided at the most recent address provided under section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act. The record reflects that the NOH was mailed to the respondent at the address she provided. Due process was satisfied here because the method of service was reasonably calculated to ensure that notice reached the alien. See Dominguez v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 284 F.3d 1258 (11th Cir. 2002) (notice of a removal hearing satisfies due process so long as the method of notice is conducted in a manner reasonably calculated to ensure that notice reaches the alien).
 
In the respondent’s motion to reopen, she admitted that she moved to California two months after being served the NTA, but she does not indicate that she filed a change of address with the Immigration Court. The duty to provide the immigration court with an updated address attached upon personal service of the NTA upon the respondent. See Matter of Anyelo, 25 I&N Dec. 337, 338-39 (BIA 2010). The respondent did not provide a change of address pursuant to this known duty until she filed her motion to reopen in 2015, over eight years after her removal hearing, and is therefore precluded from claiming that she did not receive notice. See Dominguez v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 1260 (“[N]otice [mailed] to the alien at the most recent address provided by the alien is sufficient notice” for in absentia removal). Because the immigration court properly mailed the NOH to the most recent address provided by the respondent at the Florida address listed on the NTA, she could not rely on the fact that the NOH was returned by the Postal Service as undeliverable.
 
*2 We find without merit the respondent’s appellate contention that the Immigration Judge erred in denying sua sponte reopening. Pursuant to our holding in Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), the power to reopen sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). While the respondent has presented some positive factors, these factors either individually or in the aggregate are not so exceptional as to trigger the limited authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte. Indeed, many aliens who have been present in the United States for a period of years have accumulated favorable equities subsequent to being ordered removed. See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000) (burden is on the movant to show exceptional circumstances).
 
In addition, while the respondent argues that she was misled by a notario in 2007, as the Immigration Judge found, the respondent has not identified the notario, she has not averred that the notario held himself out as an attorney, and she has not shown that she filed a complaint with the relevant state disciplinary agency (I.J. at 2). See generally Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 514 F.3d 1224, 1225-26 (11th Cir. 2008) (suggesting that Lozada applies to ineffective assistance of counsel claims rendered by non-attorneys). Moreover, contrary to the respondent’s appellate contention, she has not adequately established diligence in filing the motion to reopen, despite having personally received and signed the NTA (I.J. at 2-3; Exh. 1).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John Donovan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on April 29, 2002, when we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal for failure to file a brief. This motion, submitted on May 27, 2016, is untimely filed. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent contends that reopening is warranted due to ineffective assistance of prior counsel. To support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). The alien must also show that he was prejudiced by the prior counsel’s deficient representation. Id. at 640. Additionally, to establish that equitable tolling of the deadline for motions to reopen is warranted, the alien must show that he pursued his rights with reasonable diligence, and that some extraordinary circumstance beyond his control prevented timely filing. See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016).
 
Equitable tolling is not warranted in this case because the respondent did not demonstrate that he exercised due diligence. The respondent was ordered removed in 1999 and his appeal was summarily dismissed in 2002. However, the evidence submitted with the motion indicates that the respondent did not inform his prior counsel of his grievances until September 1, 2015, and did not file this motion until May 27, 2016 (Respondent’s Motion, Tab F). The respondent has not explained this 13-year delay.
 
Because equitable tolling of the time limits is not warranted, the respondent’s motion is untimely. Further, the DHS’s records indicate that the respondent was removed from the United States on March 8, 2011 (DHS Opposition to Motion). Thus, the departure bar divests us of jurisdiction to consider his motion sua sponte. See Ovalles v. Holder, 577 F.3d 288, 295-97 (5th Cir. 2009); Matter of Armendarez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008); see also Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, supra, at 342-44 (holding that if an alien is entitled to equitable tolling of the time limitations for a motion to reopen, the motion is a timely statutory motion not subject to the departure bar, as opposed to a regulatory motion to sua sponte reopen that is subject to the departure bar). Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied as untimely.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Margaret W. Wong, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alexandra Kostich
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Russia, appeals the Immigration Judge’s February 8, 2016, decision denying her motion to reopen her removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has submitted a response in opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, under the “““clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On August 30, 2012, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c, allowing the respondent to leave the United States voluntarily on or before December 28, 2012, before an alternate order of removal would attach. The respondent did not leave the United States during the voluntary departure period (I.J. at 1). On February 1, 2016, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings in order for the Immigration Court to reopen and terminate her case because she alleges that she is not subject to removal as charged in the Notice to Appear (“NTA”), or alternatively, to rescind her voluntary departure order and issue an alternative order of removal. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion, and the respondent appealed the denial. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision in this case.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for reopening because the respondent was given numerous continuances to await the adjudication of different Alien Relative Petitions (Form I-130) filed on her behalf by different United States citizen spouses (I.J. at 1). Moreover, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s prior counsel was not ineffective in seeking voluntary departure because the respondent was not eligible for any other relief (I.J. at 1). Finally, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent is barred from adjustment of status for not having departed the United States under the voluntary departure order (I.J. at 1).
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that neither her prior counsel nor the Immigration Judge advised her of the consequences of failing to depart under a voluntary departure order (Respondent’s Brief at 6). Additionally, she alleges that but for her prior counsel’s ineffective assistance, she would be eligible to apply for adjustment of status with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) as an arriving alien (Respondent’s Brief at 6-9).
 
*2 There is no dispute that the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. Furthermore, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the voluntary departure admonishments were provided to the respondent in the decision dated August 30, 2012 (I.J. at 1). See section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d). In regards to her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during her removal proceedings, the respondent did not demonstrate that she was prejudiced by her prior counsel’s actions (I.J. at 1). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638-40 (BIA 1988) (explaining that in order to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must show that she was prejudiced by her counsel’s performance). At the time of the August 30, 2012, hearing, the respondent had divorced her second husband who had filed the second, now revoked, petition on her behalf. The second visa petition filed on behalf of the respondent was revoked pursuant to the bar under section 204(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c), which also bars approval of all future visa petitions filed on her behalf. Thus, the respondent did not make a prima facie showing that she was eligible for adjustment of status or any other type of relief, except for voluntary departure (I.J. at 1).
 
The respondent on appeal asserts that but for her prior counsel’s ineffective assistance, she would be eligible to apply for adjustment of status (Respondent’s Brief at 6-9). However, we note that during the pendency of this appeal, the respondent’s third visa petition filed on February 19, 2016, by her third and current husband has been denied (Respondent’s Brief at 5). The respondent is therefore not eligible for adjustment of status, which is the relief that she seeks. See Mansour v. INS, 230 F.3d 902, 907 (7th Cir. 2000) (explaining that a motion to reopen will be denied if the alien fails to establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought, fails to introduce previously unavailable, material evidence, or is not entitled to the grant of relief which he sought); Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247, 258 (BIA 2007) (same).
 
Therefore, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. Because the respondent did not leave the United States voluntarily by December 28, 2012, her order of pre-conclusion voluntary departure was terminated and the alternative order of removal to Russia went into effect (I.J. at 1). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(d), (e)(2). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: RAFAEL ARMANDO ROCANO BRITO A.K.A. RAFAEL ROCANO A.K.A. RAFAEL BRITO

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gerald Karikari, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Termination; administrative closure; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s September 8, 2015, decision denying his motion to terminate proceedings and ordering him removed to Ecuador. In the alternative, the respondent requests that we exercise our authority to administratively close proceedings, or remand the record to the Immigration Judge to terminate or administratively close proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a response to the appeal, the request for administrative closure, or the motion to remand. The appeal will be dismissed. The request for administrative closure and motion to remand will be denied.1
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On May 26, 2015, the respondent submitted written pleadings admitting to the allegations and conceding that he is subject to removal as set forth in the Notice to Appear (Exhs. 1 and 2). Based on the respondent’s admissions and concessions, the Immigration Judge found him subject to removal as charged (I.J. at 1, 3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c). On September 8, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to terminate in which he argued that an order of removal would violate his constitutional rights (Respondent’s Motion to Terminate at 2, 4-12). On that same date, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to terminate (I.J. at 2-3).
 
On appeal, the respondent, through counsel, alleges that the Immigration Judge failed to provide a basis for denying the respondent’s motion to terminate other than the DHS’s opposition to the motion (Respondent’s Brief at 6). Accordingly, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge did not make an informed adjudication of the motion (Respondent’s Brief at 6). However, the record does not support the allegations of the respondent’s counsel (I.J. at 2-3). Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505-06 (BIA 1980) (finding that uncorroborated declarations of counsel are not evidence).
 
The Immigration Judge does not reference the DHS’s opposition position as a basis for denying the respondent’s motion to terminate (I.J. at 2-3). Rather, the Immigration Judge’s decision reflects that he considered the respondent’s arguments (I.J. at 2-3). The Immigration Judge, however, declined to reach the constitutional issues raised by the respondent and dismissed his argument that the Immigration and Nationality Act requires a proportionality review before an order of removal can be entered (I.J. at 2-3; Respondent’s Motion to Terminate at 2, 4-12). See Matter of Yanez, 23 I&N Dec. 390 (BIA 2002). As the respondent does not otherwise challenge this determination, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to terminate. See Matter of J-S-, 24 I&N Dec. 520, 526 n.4 (A.G. 2008) (declining to address determinations not challenged on appeal).
 
*2 For the first time on appeal, the respondent argues that proceedings should be terminated so that he may pursue a provisional unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility (Form I-601A) before United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) as part of his application for consular processing based on an approved Alien Relative Petition (Form I-130) filed on his behalf by his United States citizen wife (Respondent’s Brief at 5-9). See generally 8 C.F.R. § 212(e)(7). We disagree.
 
The authority to terminate removal proceedings is limited by regulation to a few narrow circumstances not applicable here. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1238.1(e), 1239.2(f), 1240.10(d); cf. Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I&N Dec. 1378, 1380 (BIA 2000) (requiring termination where no charge of removability is sustained). Here, the DHS did not agree to terminate proceedings and the Immigration Judge found that removability has been established by the respondent’s admissions and concessions (I.J. at 1, 3; Tr. at 17, Exh. 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c). Accordingly, termination of these proceedings is not appropriate.
 
In the alternative, the respondent requests that we administratively close proceedings or remand proceedings to the Immigration Judge to consider administrative closure based on his prima facie eligibility for a provisional unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility (Respondent’s Brief at 7-9). See 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(v). In evaluating whether administrative closure is appropriate, we consider, among other things, the reason administrative closure is sought, the likelihood the applicant will succeed on any petition, application, or other action he is pursuing outside of removal proceedings, and the ultimate outcome of removal proceedings when the case is recalendared before the Immigration Judge or the appeal is reinstated before the Board. See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012). Administrative closure is not appropriate for a purely speculative event or action, such as the approval of an application for which prima facie eligibility has not been established. Id.
 
To support his request for administrative closure on appeal, the respondent proffers evidence of his eligibility for a provisional unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(3) (Respondent’s Brief at Tabs A-D, G). However this evidence was not provided to the Immigration Judge and the Board does not consider new evidence presented for the first time on appeal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv); Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 73-74 & n.10 (BIA 1984). As the respondent has not established that he is prima facie eligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility, we are not persuaded to exercise our authority to administratively close proceedings. See Matter of Avetisyan, supra.
 
*3 Additionally, the respondent has not demonstrated that proceedings should be remanded for the Immigration Judge to consider administratively closing proceedings based on the proffered evidence (Respondent’s Brief at 8-9). “A motion to remand for the purpose of presenting additional evidence must conform to the same standards as a motion to reopen and will only be granted if the evidence was previously unavailable and would likely change the result in the case.” Matter of L-A-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 516, 526 (BIA 2015) (citing Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-72 (BIA 1992)).
 
However, the respondent has not established that the documents attached to his appeal were previously unavailable (Respondent’s Brief at 8-9). Rather, the proffered evidence pre-dates the Immigration Judge’s September 8, 2015, decision (Respondent’s Brief at Tabs A-D, G). Moreover, while the respondent concedes that his prior counsel did not submit this evidence to the Immigration Judge or request administrative closure based on a provisional unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility, he does not allege ineffective assistance of counsel or present evidence which meets the procedural requirements for such a claim. (Respondent’s Brief at 5, 9). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133, 142-43 (2d Cir. 2007) (requiring substantial compliance with Matter of Lozada). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to remand will also be denied.
 
Lastly, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s due process arguments raised on appeal. In particular, he asserts that the Immigration Judge violated his due process rights by failing to advise him of his right to request that proceedings be administratively closed based on his eligibility for a provisional unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility (Respondent’s Brief at 9-10). To establish a due process violation, the respondent must show that the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case. See section 240(b)(4) of the Act. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4); Jiang v. Mukasey, 522 F.3d 266, 270-71 (2d Cir. 2008). He must also show prejudice, which means that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged violation. See Waldron v. INS, 17 F.3d 511, 518 (2d Cir. 1993) (requiring that prejudice be established to prevail on a due process claim). On appeal, the respondent has not alleged that the Immigration Judge prevented him from reasonably presenting his case, nor has he articulated how the outcome of the proceeding might have been affected by the Immigration Judge’s inaction (Respondent’s Brief at 9-10). Thus, the respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge violated his due process rights.
 
*4 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to administratively close is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ignatius Udeani, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Laura W. Trosen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Motion to suppress evidence; termination
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to suppress evidence and terminate removal proceedings. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review all other issues, including issues of law, judgment, or discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to suppress. Further, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to allow him to amend his pleadings.
 
Regarding the respondent’s challenge of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his request to amend pleadings, the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c), reads that an Immigration Judge shall require the respondent to plead to the Notice to Appear (NTA), Form I-862, and, if the Immigration Judge is satisfied that no issues of law or fact remain, the Immigration Judge may determine that removability has been established by the admissions of the respondent. In this matter, on September 16, 2014, the respondent admitted through counsel all the factual allegations on the NTA and conceded the charge of removability (Tr. at 4). Nevertheless, at the respondent’s subsequent master calendar hearing held on September 22, 2015, the respondent through new counsel, sought to withdraw his pleadings. The respondent did not assert that the facts, as previously admitted, were incorrect. Rather, the respondent asserted before the Immigration Judge that he wished to file a motion to suppress the evidence as the information relating to his removability was obtained as a result of an unlawful detention, interrogation, and seizure. Also, the respondent suggested that he was ineffectively represented by his former counsel as she did not discuss with him the charges of removability and manner in which he was apprehended by immigration officials (Tr. at 12).
 
We concur with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request to amend his pleadings. The respondent has not shown that he was ineffectively represented or complied with any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to support his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, the respondent has not shown egregious circumstances warranting the amendment of his pleadings. The respondent does not assert that the pleadings provided by his initial attorney were a result of coercion or duress or that the charges and factual allegation in the NTA are inaccurate. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (“Absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made before, during, or even after a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity binds his client as a judicial admission.”). Accordingly, we conclude that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to amend his pleadings. See Perez-Mejia v. Holder, 641 F.3d 1143 (9th Cir. 2011).
 
*2 Regarding the respondent’s motion to suppress, in a written decision dated December 2, 2015, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to suppress the evidence of his inadmissibility obtained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. In an order dated January 12, 2016, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and ordered him removed to Honduras. The “exclusionary rule,” which requires a court to suppress evidence that is the fruit of an unlawful arrest or of other official conduct which violates the Fourth Amendment, arose in the context of criminal proceedings. It is well-established that the exclusionary rule is generally not applicable in deportation (or removal) proceedings. INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1984). The Supreme Court, however, has warned that egregious violations of Fourth Amendment or other liberties that might transgress notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the probative value of the evidence obtained may justify use of the exclusionary rule. Id. at 1050-51. In expressing reluctance to apply the exclusionary rule in the deportation context, the Supreme Court balanced the likely social benefits of excluding unlawfully seized evidence against the likely costs. Id. at 1050; see Lopez-Fernandez v. Holder, 735 F.3d 1043, 1046 (8th Cir. 2013).
 
In particular, the Supreme Court reasoned that the deterrent value of the exclusionary rule is low due to the availability of alternative deportation procedures, while the social cost is high because courts would be compelled to suppress reliable evidence and then “release from custody persons who would then immediately resume their commission of a crime through their continuing, unlawful presence in this country.” See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, supra, at 1050; Lopez-Fernandez v. Holder, supra, at 1046. “Even the objective of deterring Fourth Amendment violations should not require such a result.” See Lopez Fernandez v. Holder, supra, at 1046. In Lopez-Gabriel v. Holder, 653 F.3d 683, 686 (8th Cir. 2011), the Eighth Circuit in which this case arises noted that the case for exclusion of evidence is even weaker where the alleged misconduct was committed by an agent of a separate sovereign. The court found that if evidence were suppressed in a federal civil immigration proceeding, any deterrent effect on a local police officer would be highly attenuated. See Lopez-Gabriel v. Holder, supra, at 686; citing United States v. Janis, 428 U.S. 433, 457-58 (1976). The Eighth Circuit has not developed “an exhaustive list of the conduct that could constitute an egregious constitutional violation,” but looks at the totality of the circumstances. See Lopez-Fernandez v. Holder, supra, at 1047.
 
*3 In the present case, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion for suppression because the respondent’s motion did not establish a prima facie case of an egregious violation of the Fourth Amendment. The respondent claimed in his motion that he was questioned, arrested, and detained by the police and ICE because of his race. However, the respondent did not offer any facts or evidence to support his assumption that he was questioned and detained based on his race. The respondent does not describe any unreasonable show or use of force, or any otherwise egregious conduct during his questioning and arrest by the police. As the record does not contain any evidence to corroborate the respondent’s assertion that he was questioned and arrested based on his race, we conclude that the Immigration Judge was correct in denying the respondent’s motion to suppress evidence. See Lopez-Gabriel v. Holder, supra, at 686-87 (evidence of police officer’s alleged egregious violation during a traffic stop of Guatemalan alien was insufficient to warrant a hearing on the alien’s motion to suppress, which was filed during removal proceedings: no facts supported the alien’s assumption that he was stopped and arrested based on his Hispanic appearance, and the unrebutted police report declared that the officer stopped the alien for driving with a heavily cracked windshield and arrested him for lack of proper identification). On the whole, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s resolution in this matter.
 
Finally, the record reflects that the respondent submitted timely proof of having paid the voluntary departure bond. Hence, the period of voluntary departure will be reinstated.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
*4 WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

IN RE: FRANCISCO ARGUELLES-NOLASCO
File: AXXX XX1 503 - Louisville, KY

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey Kyle McClain, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 22, 2015, denying his motion for a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review all other issues, including issues of law, judgment or discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges the Immigration Judge denial of his motion to continue. Also, the respondent argues that he was ineffectively represented by his former counsel and seeks to remand proceedings to the Immigration Judge.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s request for a continuance of his removal proceedings. The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown, and that decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing. Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6.
 
In the instant case, on January 13, 2014, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent a continuance of nearly two years for attorney preparation. At a hearing held on December 22, 2015, the respondent sought an additional continuance in order to petition the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) for prosecutorial discretion and to provide DHS with certified dispositions of his criminal record (Tr. at 9). However, we note that the DHS attorney specifically stated at the hearing, when asked for his position with regard to the respondent’s intention to seek prosecutorial discretion that he would not agree to a continuance or a request for prosecutorial discretion as the respondent had approximately two years to seek such relief and failed to do so (Tr. at 10-11). We observe that neither the Board nor the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction over issues of prosecutorial discretion. See Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 349-50 (BIA 1982) (stating that deferred action status is a function of DHS’s prosecutorial discretion). Furthermore, we note that the DHS may choose to exercise prosecutorial discretion at any stage of the respondent’s proceedings. On this record, we find that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion for a continuance.
 
*2 Regarding the respondent’s motion for remand of proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel, we will deny such motion. The respondent has not sufficiently complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Pepaj v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 725 (6th Cir. 2007); Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996).1 Furthermore, the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim does not prevail as he has not established prejudice. The record does not reflect that the alleged ineffective representation of the respondent’s former counsel affected the final outcome of the respondent’s removal hearing. The respondent made no application for relief other than voluntary departure, which the DHS did not oppose, and the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to continue. See Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 815 (BIA 2012) (recognizing that an alien should not be granted a continuance “as a dilatory tactic to forestall the conclusion of removal proceedings”). To date, the respondent has not provided any evidence to show that he is eligible for any other relief from removal. See Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857 (6th Cir. 2006) (successful motion by alien to reopen immigration proceedings due to ineffective assistance of counsel before the Board must meet the Matter of Lozada requirements, and the alien must show that he was prejudiced by the actions or inactions of counsel); Huicochea-Gomez v. INS, 237 F.3d 696 (6th Cir. 2001) (stating that the alien carries the burden of establishing that ineffective assistance of counsel prejudiced him or denied him fundamental fairness in order to prove that he has suffered denial of due process); Denko v. INS, 351 F.3d 717 (6th Cir. 2003) (the alien will succeed on an ineffective of assistance of counsel claim in deportation proceedings if he meets his burden of showing more than mere ineffective assistance of counsel, but assistance which was so ineffective as to have impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing in violation of the fifth amendment due process clause).
 
Finally, the record reflects that the respondent submitted timely proof of having paid the voluntary departure bond. Hence, the period of voluntary departure will be reinstated.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
*3 NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.260).

In Matter of Rivera-Claros, supra, we held that an alien seeking to reopen in absentia proceedings based on her unsuccessful communications with her attorney did not establish exceptional circumstances pursuant to former section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act, where she failed to satisfy all of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim set out in Matter of Lozada. The applicant in Matter of Rivera-Claros declined to file a bar complaint against her former attorney and the Board found the applicant’s explanation to be inadequate under Lozada. Id. at 603. The Board addressed the importance of the “bar complaint” and provided numerous justifications for its requirement. Id. at 605. Specifically, the Board relies on the disciplinary process of the relevant jurisdiction’s bar as the first, and ordinarily the fastest, means of identifying and correcting possible misconduct. Id. at 604. As the Board stated in Matter of Lozada, this process not only serves to deter meritless claims of ineffective assistance of counsel but also highlights the standards which should be expected of attorneys who represent aliens in immigration proceedings. Id. at 604. The filing of the complaint also increases our confidence in the validity of the particular claim, protects against collusion between the alien and counsel, and helps to prevent unnecessary delay in immigration proceedings, including by reducing the need for an evidentiary hearing on matters that are collateral to the merits of substantive immigration law determinations. Id. at 604-05.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Amanda Bethea Keaveny, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Susan Lecker
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; administrative closure
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s November 17, 2015, decision ordering him removed from the United States to Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a response in opposition to the respondent’s appeal. The record will be remanded.
 
On July 14, 2015, the respondent admitted the factual allegations in the Notice to Appear and conceded removability (Tr. at 1). The respondent’s attorney requested several continuances to try to obtain agreement with the DHS to terminate or administratively close the proceedings because he had an approved immediate relative petition and was pursuing a provisional unlawful presence waiver from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (Tr. at 6-7, 13, 15-17). At a hearing on November 17, 2015, the DHS stated that it would not agree to administrative closure because the respondent is not eligible for a provisional waiver based on his forgery conviction (Tr. at 17). The Immigration Judge stated that he would not grant administrative closure over the DHS’s objection and allowed the respondent’s attorney time off the record to talk to the respondent about either accepting a voluntary departure order or a removal order (Tr. at 19). After consulting with the respondent off the record, the respondent’s attorney stated that the respondent would accept an order of removal and would waive appeal (Tr. at 19).
 
The respondent alleges on appeal that his acceptance of a removal order and waiver of appeal was not knowing and voluntary. He states that his attorney advised him to accept a removal order so that he could appeal the decision and that he told the attorney that he wanted to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision. He further argues that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance by waiving his right to appeal, by improperly advising him to plead guilty to forgery, by failing to file for cancellation of removal and failing to pursue parole and a provisional waiver with the DHS.
 
We conclude that the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and has stated a valid claim of ineffective assistance. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741 (4th Cir. 2006). Further, we find that the respondent’s waiver of appeal was not knowing and intelligent. See Narine v. Holder, 559 F.3d 246 (4th Cir. 2009). He states in his affidavit that he told his attorney he wanted to accept a removal order so that he would not have to waive his appeal rights, and he was not aware that his former attorney told the Immigration Judge that he agreed to waive his right to appeal (Tr. at 19). In addition, his former attorney has filed an affidavit stating that he mistakenly waived the respondent’s appeal rights and that the respondent did not intend to do so. Thus, we accept the respondent’s appeal on certification.
 
*2 The respondent has raised a claim on appeal that the Immigration Judge should have granted his request for administrative closure to allow for processing of his immigrant visa petition and to allow him to pursue a provisional waiver of unlawful presence under section 212(a)(9) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9). The DHS opposed administrative closure on the grounds that the respondent has a forgery conviction and is not eligible for a provisional waiver (Tr. at 17-18).
 
Therefore, we will remand these proceedings for the parties to be given an opportunity to present further evidence regarding the respondent’s eligibility for administrative closure, and for the Immigration Judge to make findings of fact regarding the respondent’s conviction or analyze his request for administrative closure under the standards outlined in Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the issuance of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alanna M. McCoy, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; termination
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge dated May 9, 2016, denying her motion to reopen and to terminate proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.1
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the Immigration Judge’s determination of credibility. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was ordered removed on August 4, 2010. On April 21, 2016, she filed a motion requesting sua sponte reopening and termination of her proceedings to allow her to return to El Salvador and apply for the Central American Minors (CAM) Refugee/Parole Program. The Immigration Judge denied the motion and this appeal followed.
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that the Immigration Judge erred by declining to sua sponte reopen her case. Specifically, the respondent claims that exceptional circumstances apply because (1) the program under which she seeks to apply did not exist at the time she accepted her order of removal and (2) she was young at the time she accepted her order of removal and her attorney did not seek to file relief.2 She further contends that without reopening and termination of these proceedings, she is ineligible for the CAM program.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent’s case does not warrant sua sponte reopening. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Sua sponte reopening of proceedings is invoked sparingly and reserved for truly exceptional circumstances. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-35 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (explaining that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship). While the respondent has presented sympathetic circumstances, her circumstances are not sufficiently different from ordinary hardship so as to qualify as exceptional and trigger the limited authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, supra.
 
*2 Moreover, the Immigration Judge properly noted that neither the Immigration Court nor the Board have jurisdiction to adjudicate the respondent’s application. We have concluded that administratively final removal proceedings should not be reopened for matters over which neither the Immigration Judge, nor the Board, has jurisdiction. Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2009). We thus affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio Bugge, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Chelsea Braden
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of October 8, 2015. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on April 1, 2015. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The Notice of Hearing (NOH) for the April 1, 2015, hearing was mailed to the respondent’s counsel, Antonio Bugge, Esquire, on February 9, 2015.1 The respondent failed to appear at his hearing and an in absentia order was entered on April 1, 2015. The respondent filed a motion to reopen in absentia proceedings on September 22, 2015, alleging that the respondent’s friend did not inform him of his hearing, and further alleging that counsel could not reach the respondent through his friend. The respondent further alleged that he has a United States citizen child and he seeks prosecutorial discretion and cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on October 8, 2015, noting that the respondent should have contacted counsel and finding that the respondent’s evidence did not establish paternity of the child he claimed is a qualifying relative for cancellation of removal.
 
Notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). Receipt of notice by counsel is sufficient to deny a motion to reopen based on a lack of notice. See Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir. 1999) (per curiam). The respondent also failed to demonstrate that “exceptional circumstances” prevented him from appearing at the April 1, 2015, hearing. The failure in communication between the respondent and his counsel has not been shown to be an exceptional circumstance beyond his control and sufficient to excuse his failure to appear at his scheduled hearing. See section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(4)(iii)(A)(1). In view of these circumstances, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. See generally Vukmirovic v. Holder, 640 F.3d 977, 978-79 (9th Cir. 2011) (alien’s failure to know about removal hearing because he had moved without advising his lawyer or immigration court of his whereabouts did not constitute exceptional circumstances).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent alleges that he and counsel were not able to communicate with one another because the respondent speaks neither Spanish nor English, and only speaks a native Guatemalan dialect (Respondent’s Brief, page 3). However, the respondent did not raise this in his motion to reopen. We further note that the respondent has not alleged or shown ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). For ineffective assistance to serve as an exceptional circumstance, an alien must prove counsel’s deficient performance resulted in prejudice and satisfy certain procedural requirements. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 371 F.3d 771, 775-76 (11th Cir. 2004) (per curiam). Here, while the respondent contends that he would seek cancellation of removal, as the Immigration Judge noted, he has not established that he has a qualifying relative; nor has he provided the requisite application (Form EOIR 42B). The respondent has not demonstrated that he is prima facie eligible for any relief, and thus he has failed to establish he suffered any prejudice, even had there been ineffective representation. See Dakane v. U.S. Attorney Gen., supra, at 1274 (“Prejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different”).
 
The formal rescission requirements need not be satisfied in certain circumstances where the respondent is eligible for relief that was unavailable at the time of the in absentia hearing and did not receive oral warnings in his native language regarding the bar to future discretionary relief that arises from a failure to appear. See generally Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). In such cases, the motion to reopen is subject to the 90-day filing deadline set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). The respondent’s in absentia removal order was entered on April 1, 2015. The September 22, 2015, motion was thus past the 90-day deadline for the filing of a motion to reopen seeking new relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). Consequently, the motion is untimely. Moreover, as noted above, the respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for any relief.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert B. Jobe, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen substantially complies with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), in setting out a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Given the totality of circumstances and evidence presented, including the Department of Homeland Security’s lack of response or opposition to the pending motion, and the evidence reflecting that former counsel(s)’ representation may have affected the outcome of the respondent’s proceedings, we will reopen the proceedings under the provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings on the respondent’s applications for relief. See also Correa-Rivera v. Holder, 706 F.3d 1128, 1133-34 (9th Cir. 2013) (explaining the prejudice results “when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.”) (citations omitted). In so remanding, we express no opinion on the ultimate outcome of these proceedings.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings not inconsistent with this order and the entry of a new decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mark J. Deyine, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Susan Lecker
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 This matter is before us on certification from the Immigration Judge, upon issuance of his decision of January 5, 2016. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and was prejudiced by his former attorney, who did not present his cancellation of removal application nor his request for prosecutorial discretion (Respondent’s Brief at 11-21). The respondent requests a remand to present his application for cancellation of removal and request for prosecutorial discretion (Respondent’s Brief at 22).
 
The record shows that the respondent has supported his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with the appropriate documentation required under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). However, the respondent must also demonstrate that he was substantially prejudiced by the ineffective assistance. See Figeroa v. INS, 886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir. 1989) (stating that to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must show not only ineffective representation, but also prejudice to him or her which occurred as a result of that ineffectiveness).
 
The respondent has not demonstrated that he is prima facie eligible for cancellation of removal (I.J. at 1). To date, the respondent has not submitted his application for cancellation of removal or sufficient supporting documentation to establish his eligibility for said relief. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (assertions of counsel are not evidence). Specifically, as the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent has not submitted evidence of his qualifying relatives nor provided proof of his continuous physical presence in the United States since 2004 (I.J. at 1). Thus, the respondent has not established that he is eligible for cancellation of removal.1
 
*2 In light of the foregoing, we do not find that the ineffective assistant of counsel described by the respondent established prejudice such that the outcome of his proceedings would have been different but for the ineffective assistance. Therefore, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pablo Fernandez-Herrera, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Charlotte Marquez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated December 5, 2014, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen to rescind the in absentia removal order that was entered on June 2, 2014. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the respondent’s appeal. The record will be remanded.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We are unable to meaningfully review the December 5, 2014, decision of the Immigration Judge as that order consists of a two-sentence conclusion of law without any findings of fact or analysis (Resp. Br. at 7-8). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (d)(3)(iv); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 463-65 (BIA 2002) (Immigration Judges must include in their decisions clear and complete findings of fact that are supported by the record and comply with controlling law). The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had not met his burden to establish ineffective assistance of his former counsel in order to toll the filing deadline for a motion to reopen. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Compean, Bangaly, J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009).
 
However, the Immigration Judge did not render any findings regarding what requirements of Matter Lozada, supra, for an ineffective assistance claim, have or have not been met.1 In this regard, there is evidence of record that the respondent submitted an affidavit setting forth his agreement with his former counsel, that the respondent has informed his former counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance through a complaint with a state bar, and the respondent has submitted a formal complaint against his former counsel with the appropriate disciplinary authority (Resp. Br. at 12; DHS Br. at 2-4).2 Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. Moreover, the Immigration Judge should determine whether the respondent has met his burden to establish that his former counsel’s ineffective assistance resulted in actual prejudice (Resp. Br. at 12-13). Id. at 640. Additionally, if the Immigration Judge finds that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim has been established, he should then determine if equitable tolling applies. Therefore, the record must be remanded for the preparation of a decision by the Immigration Judge that will permit meaningful appellate review. By remanding the record, the Board does not express any opinion on the final outcome of this matter.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

File: AXXX XX9 975 - Phoenix, AZ
October 14, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ray A. Ybarra Maldonado, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Motion to administratively close proceedings
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the April 24, 2015, decision of the Immigration Judge denying her motion to administratively close proceedings.1 The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a response. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s discretionary decision to deny the respondent’s request for administrative closure. See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688, 696 (BIA 2012) (outlining factors for evaluating whether administrative closure is warranted, including the likelihood of success on any underlying requests for relief).2 We observe that administrative closure is used to temporarily remove a case from an Immigration Judge’s active calendar or from the Board’s docket. See Matter of Gutierrez, 21 I&N Dec. 479, 480 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Avetisyan, supra, at 692. The administrative closure of a case does not result in a final order. It is merely an administrative convenience that allows cases to be removed from the calendar in appropriate situations, subject to being recalendared at a later date. See Matter of Amico, 19 I&N Dec. 652, 654 n.1 (BIA 1988).
 
In the present case, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to administratively close proceedings because she had no apparent relief available to her other than voluntary departure. The DHS opposed administrative closure in this case, and the DHS Office of the Chief Counsel had declined to exercise prosecutorial discretion (I.J. at 6; Tr. at 46). While the respondent argues that she is eligible for prosecutorial discretion, the DHS has sole authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion in this matter (Respondent’s Br. at 12-13). Neither the Board nor the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction over issues of prosecutorial discretion. See Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 349-50 (BIA 1982).
 
The respondent also contends that her case should be administratively closed in light of pending litigation in Puente Arizona v. Arpaio, 76 F.Supp.3d 833 (D. Ariz. 2015), or in the alternative, be held in abeyance. On January 5, 2015, the District Court for Arizona found that Arizona’s identity theft laws were facially preempted by federal immigration policy and granted the plaintiffs--an immigrant advocacy organization, individual “unauthorized aliens,” and taxpayers of Maricopa County--a preliminary injunction preventing the Arizona government defendants from enforcing the challenged provisions. Id. at 869. The respondent argues that a favorable decision in this case could result in the vacation of her conviction, where she was convicted of criminal impersonation in Arizona (Respondent’s Br. at 7; Exhs. 4-5). After the respondent submitted her brief on August 26, 2015, however, the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court’s holding that the laws are likely facially preempted and vacated the preliminary injunction. Puente Arizona v. Arpaio, 821 F.3d 1098 (9th Cir. 2016). As such, the respondent’s argument on this issue is moot.
 
*2 Finally, to the extent the respondent asserts that her due process rights were violated in the proceedings below, we are unpersuaded. See Cruz Rendon v. Holder, 603 F.3d 1104 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding that in order to prevail on a due process claim that she was denied a full and fair removal hearing, an alien must demonstrate that the challenged proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that she was prevented from reasonably presenting her case; and that she suffered prejudice, such that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged violation). The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge acted in a prosecutorial manner rather than remaining neutral, and that she was questioned by the Immigration Judge, without the presence of counsel, despite appearing in court under the belief that she would be represented (Respondent’s Br. at 4-5, 11).
 
We do not find a basis to conclude that the Immigration Judge’s management of the record establishes a due process violation. We have reviewed the record and find no basis to conclude that the Immigration Judge’s questioning or comments in any way exceeded judicial bounds. An Immigration Judge has the authority to “““interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien” in removal proceedings. See section 240(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(1); see generally Matter of Rhee, 16 I&N Dec. 607 (BIA 1978).
 
Furthermore, to the extent that the respondent made statements without the presence of counsel, such as admitting to her convictions, the record supports those statements, and the respondent has not argued otherwise (Tr. at 19-21 (Mar. 8, 2013); Exhs. 4-5). Insofar as the respondent claims that the counsel she hired did not properly represent her, the record does not reflect that she was in fact represented at the time of her final hearing; instead, it reflects that the court granted a motion to withdraw from her former counsel, but no Notice of Appearance on her behalf was filed subsequently by another representative until her appeal to the Board (Exhs. 8-9). The respondent has also not complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, or demonstrated that she suffered resultant prejudice.3 Overall, we conclude that remanded proceedings are not warranted on this basis.
 
Based on the foregoing, the discretionary benefit of administrative closure was not appropriate in this case, and the motion to administrative close was properly denied. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, supra, at 505 (once the DHS institutes proceedings, an Immigration Judge must order an alien deported if the evidence supports the charge); Matter of Avetisyan, supra, at 696. The respondent provided evidence that she paid the required voluntary departure bond; therefore, we will reinstate the period of voluntary departure. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if she provides to the DHS such evidence of her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

At the final hearing on April 24, 2015, the Immigration Judge orally denied the respondent’s motion for administrative closure. In an oral decision and form order issued the same day, the Immigration Judge also granted post-conclusion voluntary departure to the respondent.

In Matter of Avetisyan, the Board held that, in determining whether administrative closure of proceedings is appropriate, an Immigration Judge or the Board should weigh all the relevant factors presented in the case. These factors include, but are not limited to: (1) the reason administrative closure is sought; (2) the basis for any opposition to administrative closure; (3) the likelihood the respondent will succeed on any petition, application, or other action he or she is pursuing outside of removal proceedings; (4) the anticipated duration of the closure; (5) the responsibility of either party, if any, in contributing to any current or anticipated delay; and (6) the ultimate outcome of removal proceedings (for example, termination of the proceedings or entry of a removal order) when the case is recalendared before the Immigration Judge or the appeal is reinstated before the Board. Id. at 695.

Specifically, the respondent has not presented an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with her prior counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations the prior counsel did or did not make, the respondent does not indicate that her prior counsel was informed of the allegations leveled against him or her and has been given an opportunity to respond, and the respondent does not indicate whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Additionally, because the respondent has not shown that, but for her prior counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, she would have obtained post-conviction relief, she has not demonstrated that she was prejudiced by her prior counsel’s ineffective assistance.

File: AXXX XX6 496 - Los Angeles, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul Clemente Supple, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on July 5, 2007, after not appearing at her hearing. She filed a motion to reopen on August 6, 2015, and the respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 29, 2015, denying the motion. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that she did not receive the Notice of Hearing because it was mailed to her former address (Resp. Brief at 11). She further argues that her former attorney committed ineffective assistance of counsel by not raising the issue of lack of notice in her motion to reopen (Resp. Brief at 11-12). However, the respondent has not complied with any of the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. See Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893 (9th Cir. 2008) (setting forth the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In addition, the respondent has not submitted a sworn statement attesting to lack of notice, or explaining why she did not notify the Immigration Court of her change of address from that listed on the Notice to Appear. We further note that the Notice of Hearing for July 5, 2007, was not returned as undeliverable. The statements of counsel in her appellate brief are not evidence. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Consequently, we decline to reopen or remand these proceedings based on the lack of notice.
 
In addition, the respondent argues on appeal that she established an exceptional situation to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s and the Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). She states that she was not notified of her hearing and is eligible for benefits under the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program. The respondent further states that she is the parent of three United States citizen children who were born subsequent to the hearing and one of whom is being treated for cancer. The respondent argues that these proceedings should be reopened based on humanitarian considerations.
 
*2 We are sympathetic to the respondent and especially to her child who is battling a serious disease. However, the respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear on March 2, 2006, waited more than 9 years to file her motion to reopen, and she did not provide an explanation for her lack of due diligence. In addition, the Immigration Judge has no jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s eligibility for DAPA; the application for such a discretionary status or any similar exercise of prosecutorial discretion should be directed to the Department of Homeland Security. In light of the foregoing, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny sua sponte reopening of these proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: DARYS REY-LOZANO A.K.A. DARYS REY-LORENZO A.K.A. DARYS REY GARCIA
File: AXXX XX1 714 - New York, NY
September 27, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Davar Yusufi, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of August 4, 2015. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s July 9, 2015, motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia on August 12, 2005. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a reply to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen alleges that her failure to appear for her August 12, 2005, hearing was due to exceptional circumstances.1 The respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel by a non-attorney who held himself out to be an attorney. Specifically, the respondent asserts that she hired Paul Falcon and they were to meet across the street from the Immigration Court on August 12, 2005, but he did not show up, and when she called him, he advised her not to go to her hearing or she would be arrested and deported. A claim of “ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an ‘exceptional circumstance’ warranting the reopening of a deportation order entered in absentia.” Arts v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 596 (2d Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).
 
A motion to reopen alleging exceptional circumstances for a failure to appear at a removal hearing must be filed within 180 days of the order of removal, and only one such motion is allowed. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i) & 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent’s motion claiming that she did not appear at her hearing because of ineffective assistance by Mr. Falcon, was untimely, as it was filed well beyond 180 days after the removal order was entered. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case lies, has recognized that equitable tolling may apply in some circumstances. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 135 (2d Cir. 2000). The respondent is required to demonstrate “due diligence” in pursuing her claim during “both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed.” Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008); see also Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006) (requiring an alien to demonstrate due diligence independent from the requirement of demonstrating ineffective assistance of former counsel).
 
*2 The respondent here has not demonstrated or even argued that she exercised due diligence in pursuing her claim (I.J. at 2-3). The respondent stated in her affidavit supporting her motion to reopen that after failing to appear at her hearing, she went to the Fasano, Madeo law firm and informed them she had an in absentia order of deportation but they asked for too much money. The respondent has not indicated that she took any other measures to secure new counsel or otherwise pursue her claim herself. Instead, the respondent waited to seek reopening until approximately 10 years after entry of her removal order. Consequently, equitable tolling is not appropriate here. See Jin Bo Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006); Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008) (holding that petitioner failed to exercise due diligence when, after he should have known of his initial counsel’s ineffectiveness, he waited fourteen months to pursue the claim).
 
When an alien brings a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel stemming from the actions of a non-attorney immigration consultant, he must still make an effort to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See, e.g., Omar v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 647, 651 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding that the Board’s decision to deny the alien’s ineffective assistance claim against a non-attorney immigration consultant based on non-compliance with Lozada was “““neither arbitrary nor capricious”). Here, the respondent has failed to comply with the Lozada requirements insofar has she has not indicated that she informed Mr. Falcon of the allegations against him and she has further not indicated that she filed a complaint with the relevant state disciplinary authorities. The respondent has thus not even substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, supra. See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46-47 (2d Cir. 2005).
 
The respondent has proffered evidence on appeal. We do not consider evidence first submitted on appeal; rather, we review the record before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 73-74 & n.10 (BIA 1984); Matter of Maim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Even if we were to construe the respondent’s additional evidence as a motion to remand, the respondent has not shown that this evidence is new or previously unavailable, or that it could possibly alter the decision in this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (holding that a party who seeks a remand to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case). Therefore, we find that a remand is not warranted.
 
*3 Lastly, we find that the approval of the respondent’s visa petition does not warrant reopening and remand under Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). That ease provides that an alien may reopen for purposes of pursuing previously unavailable relief in circumstances where he was not given oral warnings in his native language of the consequences of failing to appear at a deportation hearing and where the motion complies with the general time limits governing motions to reopen. Neither condition is satisfied here.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e) (5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Although the record does not contain the notice of hearing for the August 12, 2005, hearing, we find no prejudice therefrom. The respondent does not allege lack of notice, and in fact asserts that she was aware of her August 12, 2005, hearing and appeared outside the Immigration Court on that date. See Garcia-Villeda v. Mukasey, 531 F.3d 141, 149 (2d Cir. 2008) (even if inadequacies in alien’s removal proceeding amounted to fundamental procedural errors, errors did not prejudice alien); United States v. Fernandez-Antonia, 278 F.3d 150, 159-60 (2d Cir. 2002) (an alien must show prejudice, which in turn requires a showing that but for the alleged constitutional violation, the result in his case might have been different).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicole T. Bowyer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert Weir
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)] - Controlled substance violation
 
212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] (lodged) - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, appeals the Immigration Judge’s February 26, 2015, decision ordering him removed. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel.1 The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a motion for summary affirmance. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and his motion will be denied.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
In the Notice of Appeal, the respondent alleges that he did not have adequate time to prepare for his hearing because on February 9, 2015, he received the court’s February 4, 2015, notice of hearing, informing him that his master calendar hearing was rescheduled to February 26, 2015, approximately 1 year sooner than his previously scheduled February 24, 2016, hearing. Specifically, the respondent alleges that he was prejudiced by the change in hearing date because he did not have adequate time to marry his fiancée or to obtain post-conviction relief. Nonetheless, the respondent did not make these arguments or request a continuance before the Immigration Judge, and we will not consider these arguments now (Tr. at 9-17). See Matter of Jimenez, 21 I&N Dec. 567, 570 n.2 (BIA 1996) (providing that the Board will not consider arguments made for the first time on appeal).
 
In his motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent asserts that his former counsel erred in his representation when he sent a colleague to appear at the respondent’s master calendar hearing on February 26, 2015, without the respondent’s prior knowledge or consent (Resp. Br. at 2). He further asserts that his colleague was unfamiliar with immigration proceedings, was unaware of the type of relief for which the respondent was eligible, and because of these factors, the Immigration Judge ordered him removed (Resp. Br. at 3).
 
*2 In presenting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must comply with certain procedural requirements. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (stating that in order to prevail on a motion to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must establish and include the following: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not); Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647-48 (5th Cir. 2014) (making mandatory strict compliance with the Lozada requirements and emphasizing that former counsel must be informed of the allegations against them before the allegations are presented in a brief to the Board).
 
Here, we find that the respondent has not substantially met these procedural requirements. Although the respondent has submitted a copy of a complaint form detailing the allegations against his former counsel, he has not submitted an affidavit describing the facts and his agreement with his former counsel, nor has he provided any evidence that his former counsel has been made aware of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond, either after or before he filed his brief to the Board. See id; see also INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984) (statements by counsel in a brief are not evidence); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980). The respondent has also not explained how he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638 (describing that in order to prevail on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must also show that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s actions). Thus, we decline to remand proceedings on this basis. Accordingly, the following orders wilt be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

The respondent titles his brief “Respondent’s Brief in Support of Appeal” (Resp. Br. at 1). However, the respondent’s brief does not allege that the Immigration Judge erred in her decision, and only requests remand on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. As the respondent has presented previously unavailable evidence and requests a remand, we will construe the arguments presented in this brief as a motion to remand. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(iv), 1003.2(c)(4); see Matter of L-A-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 516 (BIA 2015).

File: AXXX XX3 671 - New York, NY
September 9, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alison Berry, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 20, 2015, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider the Immigration Judge’s November 13, 2014, decision, in which she denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider because the motion did not specify any error of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2). In her motion to reconsider, the respondent asserted that the Immigration Judge had overlooked a question of fact in her motion to reopen, specifically that she had alleged that she had received ineffective assistance of counsel from her previous representative. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reconsider because she concluded that she had not overlooked an ineffective assistance claim in the respondent’s motion to reopen but rather that the respondent had not made such a claim in her motion to reopen.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent had not set forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in her motion to reopen. The respondent’s motion to reopen states that she had “reconsidered her decision to agree to an Order of Voluntary Departure,1 believes that her previous decision was ill-advised” and that she was “not previously aware of the legal ramifications of being grandfathered under her step-father’s petition.” In her affidavit in support of her motion to reopen, the respondent stated that it was “possible that [she] did not receive the proper legal advice.” These statements are insufficient to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, particularly in the absence of any indication of substantial compliance with the procedures set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46-47 (2d Cir. 2005). We recognize that the respondent has since taken steps to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, but this does not alter our conclusion that the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent’s motion to reconsider does not identify any error in her previous decision denying the motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2) (a motion to reconsider shall specify “errors of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s prior decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority”); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Accordingly, we likewise affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reconsider.
 
*2 We acknowledge the respondent’s contention on appeal that her case should be deferred pending the possible implementation of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (“DAPA”) program. A request for prosecutorial discretion lies within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

As the Immigration Judge noted in her November 13, 2014, decision, because the respondent filed a motion to reopen during the voluntary departure period granted pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b), the grant of voluntary departure is terminated automatically. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(iii). The respondent has not challenged this conclusion on appeal.

File: AXXX XX2 663 - Boston, MA
September 1, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vard R. Johnson, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 14, 2015, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen her removal proceedings conducted in absentia on January 5, 2010.1 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not file an opposition to the motion or to this appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The record reflects that a Notice to Appear (NTA) was served on the respondent by regular mail on September 30, 2009, to the address2 that she provided on her application for adjustment of status based on her marriage to a United States citizen (Form I-485), dated October 22, 2004, and the NTA was not returned by the postal service (I.J. at 1, 3; Exhs. 1, 2). The respondent was subsequently sent a notice of hearing (NOH) by regular mail to that same address on December 18, 2009, informing the respondent of a January 5, 2010, hearing date, and that notice was returned by the postal service (I.J. at 1). The respondent did not appear for her hearing, and on January 5, 2010, an in absentia order of removal was entered and mailed to the respondent via regular mail, again to the same address, and it was returned by the postal service (I.J. at 1). On June 24, 2014, the respondent, through counsel Micol Mion Gordon, Esquire, filed a motion to reopen in which the respondent alleged that she was denied due process because the NTA was issued years after her Form I-485 was denied.
 
In his December 14, 2015, decision, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, finding that the respondent failed to rebut the presumption that the NTA was delivered to her last known address at 9 Marney Street. In particular, the Immigration Judge noted that the NTA had not been returned by the postal service, and while the NOH had been returned by the postal service, the respondent had provided no evidence to support her assertion that she had moved to a new address.
 
We first observe that the respondent has a legal obligation to provide an address at which she can be contacted. See section 239(a)(1)(F)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(F)(i). In addition, we have held that an alien can be charged with receiving proper notice when notice “reaches the correct address but does not reach the alien through some failure in the internal workings of the household.” Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 189 (BIA 2001).
 
*2 We presume that a properly addressed notice sent via regular mail is received by the addressee. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). The Board considers all relevant evidence in determining whether an alien has rebutted the presumption. Such includes but is not limited to factors such as affidavits from the respondent and others who are knowledgeable about whether notice was received, whether due diligence was exercised in seeking to redress the situation, any prior applications for relief that would indicate an incentive to appear, and the respondent’s prior appearance at immigration proceedings, if applicable. See also Shah v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 25 (1st Cir. 2008); Matter of C-R-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 677 (BIA 2008).
 
In the respondent’s motion to reopen of June 24, 2014, the respondent admitted in her motion that she received the DHS denial of her Application for Adjustment of Status (Form I-485) mailed on October 15, 2005, which had been mailed to her 9 Marney Street address, and she averred that she kept receiving mail at that address even after she physically moved out. The respondent alleged that it was a denial of her due process for a NTA to be issued over a year after the Form I-485 had been denied. The respondent further alleged that she did not discover her in absentia order until she hired counsel apparently recently in furtherance of a new Form I-485 filing. No affidavit or other evidence accompanied the motion.
 
On appeal, the respondent now files a new motion to reopen predicated upon ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) by her prior counsel, Ms. Gordon. The respondent has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent alleges that Ms. Gordon committed IAC by failing to provide the respondent’s affidavit and other evidence with the June 24, 2014, motion to reopen.
 
The respondent has proffered an affidavit, dated February 3, 2016, in which she alleges that she did not receive the NTA or the NOH, and she further alleges that she moved from 9 Marney Street in April 2005. The respondent also lists the addresses to which she purportedly moved since then. The respondent avers that she received the October 15, 2005, DHS denial of her Form I-485 mailed to the 9 Marney Street address because although she was no longer living there, a “resident at that address called” and the respondent picked it up from that resident.
 
The respondent has also proffered a statement from her prior counsel, Ms. Gordon, in response to the IAC allegations. In Ms. Gordon’s statement, she asserts that she determined that it was unwise and unethical to submit an affidavit from the respondent given her inability to conclusively tell counsel where she lived and when. Ms. Gordon also provided notes showing the list of addresses and dates provided by the respondent and they are at least in part inconsistent with the dates and addresses the respondent now provides in her IAC claim. Ms. Gordon further notes that she contacted the respondent’s friend, Cristina Lira, who continued to reside at 9 Marney Street, and Ms. Lira was unable to confirm whether she had received the NTA, and thus Ms. Gordon determined that she could not submit an affidavit from Ms. Lira. The respondent has proffered an affidavit, dated March 9, 2016, in rebuttal to Ms. Gordon’s statement. The respondent avers that Ms. Gordon never told the respondent that her information was unreliable or that evidence in support of the motion was needed.
 
*3 We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the motion to reopen, for the reasons stated therein. Most significantly, here the Immigration Judge considered the respondent’s evidence with the motion to reopen and found that the respondent had failed to rebut the presumption of proper delivery under Matter of M-R-A-, supra. The respondent has not demonstrated that she had an incentive to appear, where her application for adjustment of status had been previously denied, or that she exercised due diligence in inquiring into her immigration status. See also Matter of C-R-C-, supra (holding that the respondent overcame the presumption of delivery of a Notice to Appear sent by regular mail where he submitted an affidavit stating that he did not receive the notice, additional evidence indicating he had an incentive to appear, and by exercising due diligence in promptly obtaining counsel and requesting reopening of the proceedings).
 
We will also deny the motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of former counsel. The respondent has not established deficient performance and further has failed to establish that she was prejudiced by Ms. Gordon’s representation. See Muyubisnay-Cungachi v. Holder, 734 F.3d 66 (1st Cir. 2013) (an alien bringing an ineffective assistance claim based on counsel’s performance during removal proceedings must establish both a deficient performance by counsel and a reasonable probability of prejudice resulting from his former representation); Zeru v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 59, 72 (1st Cir. 2007) (stating that “to succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, petitioners must show ‘a reasonable probability of prejudice’ resulting from their former representation”).
 
First, the respondent’s counsel informs that the Office of Bar Counsel has determined that it would not go forward with the complaint against Ms. Gordon as the asserted ethical violations did not rise to the magnitude it requires for a full grievance and hearing proceeding. Second, Ms. Gordon credibly explains her actions regarding the motion to reopen she filed, and her strategic decision not to include an affidavit from the respondent or her friend. Indeed, counsel’s strategic decision in this regard is not the type of conduct typically held to be “ineffective assistance.” See Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113, 127 n. 7 (BIA 1998) (citing Thorsteinsson v. INS, 724 F.2d 1365 (9th Cir. 1984)) (ineffective assistance counsel claim rejected where attorney made informed, strategic decision). Third, Ms. Gordon’s statement and her notes attached establish inconsistencies in the respondent’s assertions as to where she resided since 2001. Fourth, the respondent has not provided a statement from her friend who continued to reside at 9 Marney Street, to corroborate that she did not receive the NTA; nor has she provided objective corroboration for the addresses at which she claims to have resided, with the exception of the 68 Linden Street address. Consequently, the respondent has not met her burden to overcome the presumption of delivery of the NTA.
 
*4 The formal rescission requirements need not be satisfied in certain circumstances where the respondent is eligible for relief that was unavailable at the time of the in absentia hearing and did not receive oral warnings in his/her native language regarding the bar to future discretionary relief that arises from a failure to appear. See generally Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). In such cases, the motion to reopen is subject to the 90 day filing deadline set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). The respondent’s in absentia removal order was entered on January 5, 2010. The June 24, 2014, motion was thus long past the 90 day deadline for the filing of a motion to reopen seeking new relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b).
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge that no exceptional circumstances have been presented to warrant sua sponte reopening. Pursuant to our holding in Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), the power to reopen sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tabitha Villarrubia, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Elizabeth Treacy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled (conceded)
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 18, 2014, decision denying his motion for a continuance and ordering him removed. He also requests remand of the record for the Immigration Judge to further consider his request for a continuance of these proceedings based on new evidence. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed; and the motion to remand, denied.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for additional time to investigate possible eligibility for a derivative U nonimmigrant visa (Respondent’s Brief at 4-7; Respondent’s December 18, 2014, Motion to Continue at 2-3). See generally section 101(a)(15)(U)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U)(ii) (allowing certain relatives, including spouses, of the victims of qualifying crimes to establish eligibility for U nonimmigrant status as derivative beneficiaries).
 
The Immigration Judge has broad discretion to grant a continuance for good cause. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. We will not overturn an Immigration Judge’s decision to deny a continuance unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing. Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987). We consider the following factors when addressing continuances sought to apply for a U visa: (1) the DHS’s response to the continuance motion; (2) whether the underlying visa petition is prima facie approvable; and (3) the reason for the continuance and other procedural factors. See Matter of Sanchez Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 812-813 (BIA 2012). Here, the DHS opposed the respondent’s motion to continue before the Immigration Judge and reaffirms the opposition on appeal (DHS Brief at 6-8; Tr. at 13-14). We, therefore, consider the remaining factors as outlined in Matter of Sanchez Sosa, supra, at 812-13.
 
*2 First, the Immigration Judge correctly determined that, based on the record as constituted before her, the respondent did not show his prima facie eligibility for derivative U visa status (I.J. at 3-4). The respondent was not then married to the potential principal U visa applicant (I.J. at 3-4; Respondent’s Motion to Continue at 3). See section 101(a)(15)(U)(ii)(II) of the Act. When coupled with the fact that the respondent’s fiancée had not yet filed an application for a U visa or obtained a signed law enforcement certificate (“LEC”), the Immigration Judge reasonably concluded that the respondent’s potential U visa eligibility was speculative (I.J. at 3; Respondent’s Motion to Continue at 2-3). See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(2)(i) (noting that an applicant for a U visa must submit a signed LEC attesting that the applicant has been a victim of a qualifying crime and has been, is being, or is likely to be helpful in the investigation or prosecution of the crime); see also Matter of Sanchez Sosa, supra, at 811.
 
Second, we are unpersuaded by the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge did not properly consider, when denying his continuance request, that he had obtained new counsel approximately two weeks prior to his final hearing (Respondent’s Brief at 5, 7; I.J. at 2-3; Respondent’s Motion to Continue at 2). The Immigration Judge acknowledged that the respondent had new counsel, and nonetheless found further continuances unwarranted (I.J. at 2-4). Specifically, the Immigration Judge considered the length of the respondent’s removal proceedings, the fact that he had been represented by counsel at all of his hearings, and the 18-month continuance granted at the previous hearing for the respondent to prepare any forms of relief for which he may have been eligible (I.J. at 2-4; Tr. at 9, 11).
 
Further, the respondent argues the Immigration Judge did not consider that his identification documents were stolen, and thus he could not marry his fiancée prior to the scheduled hearing because he was awaiting replacements (Respondent’s Brief at 5; I.J. at 3-4; Respondent’s Motion to Continue at 3). Notwithstanding the respondent’s argument, we are unpersuaded by his assertion that he was prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s continuance denial (Respondent’s Brief at 3; I.J. at 3-4). See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983) (“[A]n immigration judge’s decision denying the motion for continuance will not be reversed unless the alien establishes that that denial caused him actual prejudice and harm and materially affected the outcome of his case.”); see also Matter of Perez-Andrade, supra, at 434. Notably, as outlined above, even setting aside that he and his fiancée had not yet married, the respondent did not otherwise establish prima facie eligibility for derivative U visa classification.
 
*3 Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the respondent was not denied a full and fair hearing.1 See Matter of Perez-Andrade, supra, at 434. We, therefore, affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to continue.
 
The respondent also seeks remand based on new evidence that he is now married and his wife is the beneficiary of a signed LEC (Respondent’s Brief at 7, Tab A).2 Notably, notwithstanding the passage of time, the respondent has not otherwise presented evidence establishing his or his wife’s prima facie eligibility for U visa classification. See Matter of Sanchez Sosa, supra, at 811, 814-15 (explaining that (1) the principal applicant has the burden to establish prima facie eligibility; (2) any U visa applicant must establish that he is admissible or that he has sought and qualifies for any necessary waivers of inadmissibility; and (3) as appropriate, the applicant should generally provide the Immigration Judge with any completed U visa applications and filing receipts issued by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to demonstrate that he is prosecuting his U visa application and is prima facie eligible for this benefit); 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(b), (c)(2), (c)(4). Because the respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for a U visa, we will deny his request for remand. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-72 (BIA 1992) (holding that the Board may deny a motion to remand where prima facie eligibility for relief is not established); see also 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(b) (discussing requirements for a U visa).3
 
We will not address the respondent’s argument on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for voluntary departure, as the respondent specifically declined to seek this relief at his final hearing (Respondent’s Brief at 3; Tr. at 14-15). See Matter of D-R-, 25 I&N Dec. 445, 457 (BIA 2011); Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 261 n.1 (BIA 2007). Similarly, although the respondent generally maintains he is eligible for cancellation of removal for certain non-permanent residents under section 240A(b), 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), we note that he has not submitted any persuasive evidence, or even made a proffer, to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for this benefit (Notice of Appeal). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*4 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

Although the respondent alleged on the Notice of Appeal that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, he did not pursue this argument in his brief nor did he comply with the Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), requirements (Notice of Appeal From a Decision of an Immigration Judge (Form EOIR-26)). See Guzman-Rivadeneira v. Lynch, 822 F.3d 978, 983-84 (7th Cir. 2016) (requiring compliance with the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, as necessary in showing ineffective assistance of counsel). Therefore, we will not address this issue further. See Matter of G-G-S-, 26 I&N Dec. 339, 340 n.2 (BIA 2014).

We take administrative notice of the respondent’s February 20, 2015, marriage and the existence of a signed LEC executed by the Marion County Deputy Prosecutor (Respondent’s Brief at Tab A).

The respondent also claims eligibility for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (“DAPA”) (Notice of Appeal). This relief is currently unavailable. See Texas v.

In addition, any request for prosecutorial discretion must be directed to the DHS, as the DHS has sole authority over such a request. See Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348 (BIA 1982).

IN RE: TOJIDDIN BERDIEV
File: AXXX XX7 737 - Denver, CO
August 30, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Youry Ziankovich, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The final administrative order in this matter was entered by the Board on February 24, 2015, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal,1 and reinstated his 60-day period of voluntary departure that was granted by the Immigration Judge. On May 19, 2016, he filed a motion to reopen asserting eligibility for adjustment of status based on the visa petition filed by his current United States citizen wife. It is also alleged that the respondent received ineffective assistance from former counsel in his proceedings before the Immigration Judge and in conjunction with his Board appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely because it was filed more than 90 days after we rendered the final administrative decision in his case on February 24, 2015. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). He also has not demonstrated that his motion falls within any exception to the 90-day filing deadline, as provided for under the statute and regulations. See section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i)-(iv).
 
In moving to reopen, it is asserted that the respondent received ineffective assistance by former counsel who, it is said, did not timely notify him that his Board appeal had been dismissed, and that his 60-day period of voluntary departure had been reinstated. Motion to Reopen (Motion) at #4, #15-16, #22-25. However, his submissions do not demonstrate satisfaction with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.2
 
We also decline to reopen the respondent’s removal proceedings sua sponte, as there has been no showing of exceptional circumstances warranting such action. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999). Becoming eligible for adjustment of status after entry of an alien’s final administrative decision does not, in itself, constitute an exceptional circumstance warranting reopening on our own motion. Moreover, the respondent has not shown that the visa petition filed by his current USC wife has been approved. Thus, he has not demonstrated current prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status.3
 
*2 It is also claimed that former counsel provided ineffective assistance by not pursuing an asylum application for the respondent at his removal hearing, and that this constitutes exceptional circumstances justifying sua sponte reopening. Motion at #28-32. This contention has been advanced by current counsel, not the respondent himself. It is well settled that statements by counsel do not constitute evidence. Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980); Matter of Laureano; 19 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (BIA 1983), n. 2. In any event, as noted above, there has been no showing of compliance with the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance by former counsel in accordance with Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
We further observe that the respondent has not requested or demonstrated eligibility for reopening to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions/circumstances arising in Tajikistan since his last hearing that materially affect his current eligibility for such relief. Section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).
 
Finally, we deny the request to “rescind” the respondent’s order of removal. Motion at #1. The respondent does not deny that he is removable as charged, as found by the Immigration Judge. He also has not demonstrated eligibility for relief from removal.
 
Insofar as the respondent seeks a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion, or a stay of removal based on his personal circumstances, he must direct his requests to the DHS.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

On appeal, the respondent challenged the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance, which he sought so that an appeal could be filed of the denial of the second visa petition filed in his behalf by his first United States citizen wife.

2

The respondent does not argue that the 90-day filing deadline for his motion to reopen is equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance by former counsel. In addition, he has not cited any controlling circuit law establishing that the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit applies the doctrine of equitable tolling in cases such as this. In any event, he has not demonstrated compliance with Matter of Lozada, id., regarding claims of ineffective assistance by attorney Brett Davies, who last represented him at his hearing and on appeal.

3

The respondent also has not squarely addressed whether he is now precluded from adjustment of status consideration pursuant to section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), due to his failure to depart the country prior to expiration of his voluntary departure period.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James A. Benzoni, Esquire
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. He appeals from an Immigration Judge’s July 21, 2015, summary order, which stated that he had waived the right to appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed, based on lack of jurisdiction, as the respondent waived the right to appeal to the Board.
 
The Immigration Judge granted a period of pre-hearing voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), and. noted that the respondent had waived the right to appeal to the Board. Matter of Ocampo, 22 I&N Dec. 1301 (BIA 2000) (grant of voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act requires a waiver of the right to appeal); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(D). The transcript of proceedings shows that the respondent, represented by counsel, waived appeal after assuring the Immigration Judge that he had explained to the respondent that a waiver meant that the order would be final (Tr. at 10-11). On August 17, 2015, the respondent nevertheless filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26).1
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(G) (summary dismissal of appeal appropriate where appeal is barred based on waiver of right to appeal).
 
The respondent fails to show that the waiver was invalid. As noted, the respondent was represented by counsel at the final hearing on July 21, 2015. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, supra, at 1322-23.
 
The respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and therefore did not knowingly waive the right to appeal to the Board. However, he fails to show prejudice resulting from the claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. Valencia v. Holder, 657 F.3d 745, 749 (8th Cir. 2011), citing Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988). The respondent has not demonstrated that he is prima facie eligible for any relief available to him in removal proceedings.
 
*2 At the July 21, 2015, removal hearing, counsel conceded that the respondent was ineligible for any relief in removal proceedings and was continuing to prepare his U non-immigrant visa application (Tr. at 9). Counsel for the respondent therefore pursued a grant of voluntary departure, and waived appeal (Tr. at 9-11).
 
The respondent’s brief seeks to allege ineffective assistance of counsel with regards to the respondent’s application for a U non-immigrant visa, but does not address any error in his prior counsel’s concession that the respondent’s only eligible relief in removal proceedings is voluntary departure.
 
Applicable regulations pertaining to U-visas state clearly that “USCIS has sole jurisdiction over all petitions for U nonimmigrant status.” 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1). In addition, with regard to aliens subject to a final order of removal, the regulations make clear that an alien with an outstanding removal order may nevertheless pursue a petition for a U-visa with the USCIS and that the alien “may file a request for a stay of removal” with the USCIS pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a) and 8 C.F.R. § 1241.6(a). 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1)(ii). Neither the Board nor the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction over a U-visa petition. Thus, the respondent has not established prejudice from prior counsel’s actions or inactions.
 
The appeal will, therefore, be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and the record of proceedings is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anthony M. Giordano, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Fen Lu
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on February 20, 2014, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. On May 13, 2016, the respondent filed another motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred. Section 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent, however, argues that his proceedings should be reopened based on the ineffective assistance by attorney George Echevarria, who represented him before the Immigration Judge, on appeal, and in his prior motion to reopen. The respondent also argues that the motion should be granted because the form I-130 visa petition filed by his lawful permanent resident spouse was approved by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in February 2016. We will address these arguments in turn.
 
First, the respondent argues that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance. However, the respondent has not shown that he has sufficiently complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent’s affidavit submitted in support of the motion states that the former counsel “has been provided with a copy of this affidavit and has not responded to date” (Motion Exh. H, at ¶ 5). The respondent, however, has not explained how former counsel was provided a copy of “this affidavit,” which states that former counsel was provided with a copy of the document and has not responded. The respondent also has not presented other documentary evidence showing that his statement regarding ineffective assistance of counsel claim was provided to the former counsel, or when.
 
Furthermore, the respondent has not explained how he was prejudiced by the former counsel’s performance. Although former counsel appears to have continued to represent the respondent until at least February 2016 (see Motion Exh. E), the respondent has not explained how his recent performance was inadequate or how he was prejudiced by such ineffective assistance. The respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel appears to be related only to the denial of a continuance by the Immigration Judge at his October 31, 2011, hearing date. The respondent has not explained why he did not file an ineffective assistance of counsel claim earlier regarding the alleged deficient performance in 2011. See, e.g., Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127 (2d Cir. 2008) (discussing due diligence in filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
*2 The respondent’s statement submitted with the motion states that on October 31, 2011, the day of his previous hearing, the former counsel “was not ready to go forward and as a result the [Immigration] Court decided to order me removed” and, although the former counsel filed a motion to continue the case and provided proof of mailing the motion, “the [Immigration] Court indicated that it did not receive the motion and also that other papers were not filed by the deadline set by the [Immigration] Court” (Motion Exh. H, at ¶¶ 3-4; see Tr. at 37). However, the respondent states that he decided not to file a bar complaint against the former counsel because he “made an innocent mistake calendaring the matter” (Motion Exh. H, at ¶ 6). The respondent further admits that, at the October 31, 2011, hearing date, he had not provided supporting documents for his cancellation of removal application that had been requested by the former counsel, and that would have been “critical” to the success of the respondent’s case (id.). The respondent, therefore, has not made “a prima facie showing that he would have been eligible for the relief and that he could have made a strong showing in support of his application,” such that he was prejudiced by any ineffective assistance of counsel.1 Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d 879, 882 (2d Cir. 1994). Based on the above, the respondent has not shown that his proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of the former counsel.
 
We will next address the respondent’s arguments based on the approval of a Form i-130 visa petition filed by his lawful permanent resident spouse and seeking adjustment of status. This aspect of the motion does not fall within any exception to the motion to reopen time limitations enumerated in section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). The respondent urges us to sua sponte reopen his proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), based on the circumstances of his case, including the claim of former counsel’s ineffective assistance, the USCIS delay in adjudicating the visa petition, and other factors. We do not find that the respondent’s case presents an exceptional situation that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to reopen sua sponte “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”).
 
Based on the above, the respondent’s motion will be denied. The motion for stay of removal is denied as moot.
 
*3 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The record also shows that there was concern about the respondent’s eligibility for cancellation of removal, in light of his criminal record (I.J. at 3-4; Tr. at 40-41). The respondent’s motion does not address the issue of whether he would have been statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal on October 31, 2011. The respondent’s statement only suggests that a sex offense charge in 1997 has been dismissed but this was not reflected in the documentary evidence available in 2011 (Motion Exh. H, at ¶ 6.c).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brian A. Seyfried, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michelle M. Venci
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on November 10, 2014, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On July 13, 2016, more than VA years after the Board’s order, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent, however, argues that his proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney Jorge A. Rodriguez, his former counsel who represented him at hearing and on appeal.
 
We will first address the respondent’s argument that he should be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), because the former counsel was suspended from the practice of law. The respondent argues that, because the former counsel was already suspended, he could not contact the former counsel to inform him about the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and it would be futile to file a bar complaint against him (Motion, at LA1). However, a document submitted with the motion regarding the former counsel, which appears to have been printed out on June 24, 2016, contains the former counsel’s contact information with his business address and telephone numbers (Motion Exh. C, at 8). Furthermore, although the former counsel was suspended from the practice of law for a specified period from October 16, 2013, to November 15, 2013, documents submitted by both the respondent and the DHS show that he is currently “active” and authorized to practice law (Motion Exh. C; DHS Opp. Attachment). Under these circumstances, the respondent’s explanations on why he should be deemed to have complied with Matter of Lozada, supra, are unfounded and insufficient.
 
In addition, the respondent’s motion is untimely as noted above, and the respondent has not shown how he has exercised due diligence since the Board’s final administrative decision before filing the motion to reopen. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has required that, while a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel may be subject to equitable tolling of the motion time limitations, an alien must demonstrate “““due diligence” in order to succeed on a claim for equitable tolling. El-Gazawy v. Holder, 690 F.3d 852, 859 (7th Cir. 2012); Johnson v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 795, 799 (7th Cir. 2007); Patel v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 1011, 1016 (7th Cir. 2006). The respondent’s motion prepared by the counsel suggests that the respondent was not aware of the final order of removal until he was taken into immigration custody, which occurred in 2016 (Motion, I.B). However, counsel’s statement in a motion or brief is not evidence. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Furthermore, the respondent’s statement submitted with the motion states that in 2013 he was aware of the order of removal and appealed the decision, although the appeal was unsuccessful (Motion Exh. A, at ¶ 92). Therefore, the respondent has not shown that he was not aware of the order of removal until 2016, or that he has practiced due diligence.
 
*2 Even if the respondent’s motion were to be considered timely and the respondent had complied with Matter of Lozada, supra, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is unsupported by the record of his case. The respondent argues that the former counsel provided ineffective assistance by not telling him about his final hearing date at the Immigration Court, which was March 6, 2013 (Motion, I.A.1; Motion Exh. A, at ¶¶ 6-8, 11). However, the record of proceedings of this case shows that the respondent did attend his March 6, 2013, hearing with the former counsel (Tr. at 29). The record also shows that the respondent was orally advised of the Immigration Judge’s decision and his appeal rights through an interpreter (Tr. at 29, 39-40). Therefore, the respondent’s factual assertions regarding ineffective assistance of former counsel are unfounded and contradicted by the record of this case.3
 
In sum, the respondent has not shown that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance by not informing him of his hearing date at the Immigration Court. The respondent also has not shown that the motion to reopen time limitations should be equitably tolled in his case, or that contacting the former counsel or filing a bar complaint in compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, was impossible and/or futile. Based on the above, the respondent’s motion will be denied. The motion for stay of removal is denied as moot.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent’s motion was not paginated as required in Board of Immigration Appeals Practice Manual, § 3.3(c)(iii) at 40 (Apr. 26, 2016) (“Briefs and other submission should always be paginated”).

2

The respondent’s “Affidavit” was purported to have been made under penalties of perjury, but it contains no signature by anyone, and was not sworn to by anyone before an officer authorized to administer oaths (Motion Exh. A). Therefore, it does not qualify as an affidavit. Even if were to assume that this statement was actually from the respondent and therefore constitutes “““evidence,” it still would not support the factual assertions in the motion as noted above.

We also note that the respondent’s current counsel had made a request to review the respondent’s record of proceedings at the Immigration Court in June 2016, thus he would have been in a position to be apprised of the record of this case before filing the current motion to reopen (Motion Exh. B).

IN RE: GABRIEL LOPEZ-SANCHEZ

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Romy L. Lerner, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Timothy M. Cole
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Motion to Suppress; motion to terminate; motion to retract and substitute
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated February 25, 2015, which denied his motion to retract and amend his declaration in support of his prior motion to suppress, and ordered him removed from the United States to Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security has filed a response to the appeal, which will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). Considering the arguments advanced on appeal and the lack of clear error in the Immigration Judge’s factual findings, we adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act.
 
As background, the respondent initially filed a motion to suppress before the Immigration Judge on March 24, 2014. Therein, he argued, inter alia, that the DHS’ Form I-213 arose from an illegal arrest, and he sought to terminate proceedings. However, the respondent attached a declaration to his motion which admitted that he was “born in San Geronimo de los Dolores, Mexico, on June 28, 1986.” Thereafter, on April 7, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to retract this declaration, and to substitute a similar declaration without the respondent’s admission of alienage. In a decision dated May 20, 2014, the Immigration Judge found “no just cause” to grant the motion to retract and substitute the respondent’s declarations, and, relying on the respondent’s declaration of alienage, he found the motion to suppress moot (May 20, 2014, I.J. Dec. at 2). The Immigration Judge then shifted the burden to the respondent, under section 291 of the Act, to establish time, place, and manner of entry. See 8 C/F/R. § 1240.8(c). In a pleading dated January 16, 2015, the respondent did not deny his alienage, but also declined to offer evidence on the time, place or manner of his entry. The Immigration Judge ultimately found, in a decision dated February 25, 2015, that the respondent had conceded his alienage and that he had not demonstrated that he had any lawful status in the United States (Feb. 25, 2015, I.J. Dec. at 2-3). Inasmuch as the respondent also did not seek relief from removal, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed to Mexico pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act (Feb. 25, 2015, I.J. Dec. at 3).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not allowing him to retract and amend the statement in his motion to suppress which stated that the respondent was from Mexico. The respondent argues, inter alia, that the admission was a “clerical mistake” evidenced by the fact that the basis of his entire motion to suppress involved the suppression of his alienage. In support of his argument, the respondent relies heavily on the Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure to argue the fairness of allowing the respondent to retract his admission.
 
In response, the DHS argues that Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) controls the outcome of the respondent’s case. We agree. In Velasquez, the Board held that an alien’s lawyer’s admissions in immigration proceedings are binding absent “egregious circumstances.” The Velasquez exception may apply to a concession that (1) was “the result of unreasonable professional judgment,” (2) was so unfair that it produced an unjust result, or (3) was untrue or incorrect. Id.; see also Guzman v. Lynch, 822 F.3d 978 (7th Cir. 2016); Santiago-Rodriguez v. Holder, 657 F.3d 820, 831-32 (9th Cir.2011); Hanna v. Holder, 740 F.3d 379, 387-88 (6th Cir.2014) (“as a threshold matter” the alien must argue “that the factual admissions or concessions of removability are untrue or incorrect,” and that they came from unreasonable professional judgment or produced an unjust result).
 
The respondent does not allege that his admission in incorrect; in fact, as the DHS argues on appeal, the evidence sought to be suppressed by the respondent also indicates that he was born in Mexico on June 28, 1986 (DHS Exh. B). The undisputed truth of the respondent’s declaration of alienage does not unjustly result in his removal; moreover, because the respondent’s attorney explains the inclusion of the respondent’s alienage as a “clerical error”, we also find that no unreasonable professional judgment was involved in the respondent’s admission.1 As such, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s reliance on the respondent’s admission of alienage, and no egregious circumstances which would support the respondent’s request to retract this admission. As such, because alienage was established, we also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate that the respondent by clear and convincing evidence that that he is lawfully in the United States pursuant to a prior admission. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(c). We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s order to remove the respondent from the United States to Mexico under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act, and the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note that the Seventh Circuit in Guzman v. Lynch, supra, recognized possible overlap between the Velasquez exception and the ineffective assistance of counsel requirements as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 18 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent has not set forth a Lozada claim, but we note that such guidelines require a different standard of effectiveness and prejudice.

IN RE: EVILA QUIROZ HERNANDEZ
File: AXXX XX6 189 - San Diego, CA
August 8, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hannah E. Stone, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 21, 2015, denying the respondent’s May 20, 2015, motion to reopen her April 21, 2015, removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a brief in response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The record reflects that a December 29, 2014, Notice of Hearing (NOH) for a February 12, 2015, hearing was served on the respondent while in DHS custody (I.J. at 3). On January 20, 2015, a NOH informing of the changed hearing date of April 21, 2015, was mailed to the Fresno, California address the respondent provided in her Form I-830, Notice to EOIR: Alien Address. The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia on April 21, 2015, when she failed to appear. Service by mail is sufficient if the record contains proof of attempted delivery to the last address provided by the alien in accordance with section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(F). Section 239(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(c). As notice was properly provided, and as the respondent failed to appear for her hearing, the Immigration Judge properly issued an in absentia order of removal.
 
On May 5, 2015, the respondent filed a Form EOIR-33, Alien’s Change of Address reflecting a Manson, Washington address. On May 20, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. In the respondent’s motion to reopen, she alleged in her affidavit that she filed an updated address with the Immigration Court on April 8, 2015, but “never received in the mail any information from the Immigration Court telling me when I had court” and “never knew when I had to go to court” (Respondent’s Declaration). The Immigration Judge properly denied the motion to reopen, finding that the respondent’s move in April 2015 did not relieve her from appearing at her hearing, noting that the NOH was not returned as undeliverable by the postal service, and concluding that the respondent failed to establish lack of proper notice and further did not establish that exceptional circumstances prevented her appearance.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent now presents a new theory, which is contradictory to the initial claim in her motion to reopen. Specifically, the respondent has proffered a sworn statement on appeal in which she concedes receipt of the NOH for the April 21, 2015, hearing, but she alleges that a “““deportation officer” advised the respondent that if she filed a change of address form with the Immigration Court, the location of her hearing would be changed, and the respondent also avers that she believed that after she filed a change of address, her court date would also change. In her appeal brief, the respondent alleges that her previous counsel erroneously filed a motion to reopen based upon lack of notice rather than exceptional circumstances.
 
The respondent has not established that the proffered statement and allegations on appeal are new and previously unavailable. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); Bhasin v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 977, 984 (9th Cir. 2005). Furthermore, to the extent the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of previous counsel, she has failed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and the alleged ineffective assistance is not plain on the face of the record. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 594, 597-98 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting the importance of the notice and affidavit requirements in assessing the merits of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000) (to prevail on a due process challenge, a petitioner must show error and substantial prejudice). Consequently, we find no basis to disturb the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andres J. Ortiz, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 10, 2016, denying her motion to reconsider the denial of her motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia on December 13, 2005, for her failure to appear for her hearing. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed no reply to the appeal. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The Notice to Appear (“NTA”) was personally served on the respondent on June 18, 2005, and the NTA indicates that the respondent was provided oral notice in the Spanish language of the consequences of a failure to appear (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). The NTA also reflects that the respondent was informed of, among other things, the statutory address obligations associated with removal proceedings and of the consequences of failing to provide a current address.
 
Two Notices of Hearing (“NOH”) dated August 10, 2005, for a December 13, 2005, hearing were mailed to the Redwood, CA address reflected in the respondent’s NTA, and both were returned by the postal service (I.J. at 1). The respondent failed to appear for that hearing. Service by mail is sufficient if the record contains proof of attempted delivery to the last address provided by the alien in accordance with section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(F). Section 239(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(c). As notice was properly provided, and as the respondent failed to appear for her hearing, the Immigration Judge properly issued an in absentia order of removal.
 
The respondent admits that she never resided at the Redwood, CA address, and further admits that she never filed any corrected address with the Immigration Court. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674-75 (BIA 2008) (stating that an alien must comply with the statutory responsibility to provide current address information). As the respondent has not established that she complied with her duty to inform the Immigration Court, within 5 days, of a proper address, she is not entitled to rescission of the order of removal. See section 240 (b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii). See also Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d 354, 360 (5th Cir. 2009) (an alien’s failure to receive actual notice of a removal hearing due to his neglect of his obligation to keep the immigration court apprised of his current mailing address does not mean that the alien did not receive notice).
 
*2 We find without merit the respondent’s contention that she was not provided oral advisements in the Spanish language. The NTA was personally served on the respondent and the NTA reflects that the respondent was informed of, among other things, the statutory address obligations associated with removal proceedings and of the consequences of failing to provide a current address (Exh. 1). The NTA specifically informed the respondent that if she failed to provide updated contact information “then the Government shall not be required to provide you with written notice of your hearing,” and that if she failed to appear at her hearing, which could be held at “any date and time later directed by the Immigration Court, a removal order may be made by the immigration judge in your absence, and you may be arrested and detained by the INS.” Exh. 1. Even accepting as true the respondent’s averments that Spanish oral advisals were not provided, current law does not require that the NTA be in any language other than English to constitute effective notice. See section 239 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229. Moreover, the requirement of oral notice in an alien’s native language is only necessary to trigger the sanctions in section 240(b)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(7), which limits an alien’s eligibility for discretionary relief for failure to appear at removal proceedings. Consequently, the NTA and NOH complied with statutory requirements. See Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, supra.
 
The respondent argues that prior counsel, who filed the motion to reopen, failed to raise the issues the respondent raises in her motion to reconsider. However, the respondent has not specifically alleged ineffective assistance of counsel; nor has she complied with any of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent has not established that her former counsel did not employ a reasonable tactical decision, and as such is not amenable to a finding that the attorney was ineffective. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 681 (1984) (noting that counsel’s informed strategic decisions must be respected if they are based on professional judgment). Subsequent dissatisfaction with a strategic decision of counsel is not grounds for reopening. Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998).
 
Nor is reopening warranted under Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998) as the motion was untimely for purposes of new relief. Id.
 
*3 Pursuant to our holding in Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), the power to reopen sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). While the respondent has presented some positive factors in support of sua sponte reopening, these factors either individually or in the aggregate do not trigger the limited authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte. Indeed, many aliens who have been present in the United States for a period of years have accumulated favorable equities subsequent to being ordered removed. See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000) (burden is on the movant to show exceptional circumstances). In reaching this conclusion we note that the respondent did not diligently pursue her immigration status as she first filed her motion to reopen proceedings almost 10 years after being ordered removed in absentia, and 2 years after discovering her in absentia order.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Charlie E. Carrillo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of July 15, 2015. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s May 28, 2015, motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on October 24, 2006. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The Notice of Hearing (NOH) for the October 24, 2006, hearing was mailed to the respondent’s former counsel, Jose Guerrero, Esquire, on September 18, 2006 (I.J. at 2; Exh. 2). The respondent failed to appear at his hearing and an in absentia order was entered on October 24, 2006. The respondent filed a motion to reopen in absentia proceedings through present counsel on May 28, 2015, alleging that he did not receive notice of his hearing. The motion further alleged that prior counsel failed to inform the respondent of his hearing and the respondent noted that he had attempted to file a change of venue request which was rejected by the Immigration Court. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding the motion based upon exceptional circumstances was untimely and finding reopening not warranted based upon lack of notice because notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
Contrary to the respondent’s contention in his motion to reopen, the filing of a Form EOIR-28 constitutes an entrance of appearance for all proceedings, including removal and bond. There is no “limited” appearance of counsel in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). The respondent has not contested the Immigration Judge’s finding in this regard (I.J. at 3), and therefore the issue is deemed abandoned. See Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191, 196-197 n.4 (BIA 1990) (noting that issues not addressed on appeal are deemed waived).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues, inter alia, that it was procedural error not to send the rejection notice of the respondent’s change of venue request to the respondent. However, the record indicates that the rejection notice was indeed mailed to the respondent at the address he provided in the request. Moreover, the fact that the respondent attempted to file a change of venue does not excuse the respondent’s failure to appear at his October 24, 2006, hearing. It is well established that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the respondent from his responsibility to appear, and unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. See Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260, 262 (BIA 1985), aff’d, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986) (the submission of a motion for a continuance does not relieve an alien or his attorney of the responsibility to attend a deportation hearing of which they have been given notice). Nor has the respondent related how rejection of his request to change venue is relevant to whether prior counsel received notice of the hearing.
 
*2 The respondent also maintains on appeal that the Immigration Judge failed to consider equitable tolling. The respondent did not expressly argue in his motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge that his motion should be equitably tolled and thus the Immigration Judge did not err in not addressing this issue. We further note that even if the immigration statutes are subject to equitable tolling, the respondent has failed to show that such tolling would apply here. See Mata v. Lynch, __ U.S. __, 135 S.Ct. 2150, 2156 & n. 3 (2015) (expressing no opinion as to whether the immigration statutes allow equitable tolling). Specifically, the respondent admits that he became aware of his 2006 in absentia order when he was removed in 2010 (Respondent’s Brief, page 5). Consequently, contrary to the respondent’s contention on appeal, we find that he has not established due diligence, because he has not explained why he waited approximately 5 years after discovering his in absentia order to file a motion to reopen. See Medina-Herrera v. Gonzales, 162 Fed. Appx. 329 (5th Cir. 2006) (unpublished) (although generally the determination of whether party has exercised due diligence for purposes of equitable tolling requires finding of fact, Board of Immigration Appeals may determine as a matter of law that party failed to exercise due diligence, where facts on the record are undisputed and the result is inarguable). See also Mendoza-Cortez v. Lynch, ___ F.3d ___, No. 15-60332, 2016 WL 3383417, at 1 (5th Cir. June 17, 2016) (even if the time period for filing a motion to reopen may be equitably tolled, alien has not demonstrated that she would be entitled to equitable tolling because she has not shown that she acted with due diligence).
 
An alien may raise ineffective assistance of counsel as a ground for reopening a deportation case “in ‘egregious circumstances.”DD’ Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006) (quoting Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). However, as a procedural prerequisite for the Board or Immigration Judge to consider a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must provide (1) his own affidavit attesting to the facts, including a statement of the terms of the attorney-client agreement; (2) evidence that counsel was informed of the ineffectiveness allegations and allowed an opportunity to respond; and (3) evidence of a disciplinary filing against the offending attorney or an explanation as to why a grievance was not filed.
 
Here, the respondent has not shown that he has fully complied with the Lozada requirements. See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-98 (5th Cir. 2000) (finding that the Board does not abuse its discretion by requiring compliance with Lozada). First, while the respondent proffered statements regarding his fear of returning to El Salvador (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab O), none outline the terms of the attorney-client agreement he had with his former counsel. Second, while the respondent has proffered evidence on appeal that he communicated with former counsel requesting information, he has not shown that his former counsel has been informed of the allegations of ineffective assistance. Third, while the respondent avers that a complaint against his former counsel has been drafted, he has not shown that the complaint was in fact filed with the state bar. Nor has the respondent explained why the grievance has not been filed. See Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 648 (5th Cir. 2014) (finding that Lozada makes clear that the second requirement is only met when counsel is informed of the charge before allegations of ineffective assistance are presented to the Board and finding the alien did not offer sufficient proof to show that his attorney was informed or had a reasonable opportunity to respond before the allegations were presented in his appeal brief to the Board; nor did the alien offer any adequate reason that his failure to follow the rules should be excused).
 
*3 While the Immigration Judge did not expressly address the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim, he found the motion based upon exceptional circumstances to be untimely. Even if there was error by the Immigration Judge, we find that the respondent has failed to show prejudice therefrom. Specifically, the respondent has not established that he is entitled to equitable tolling, and he has not complied with the Lozada procedural requirements, and thus we find the respondent has failed to show prejudice stemming from the Immigration Judge’s failure to address the ineffective assistance claim. See Ogunfuye v. Holder, 610 F.3d 303, 306-07 (5th Cir. 2010) (explaining that the respondent must make a showing of substantial prejudice before he can prevail on a due process claim); De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir. 2004) (same). See also Chen v. Gonzales, 157 Fed. Appx. 739, 741 (5th Cir. 2005) (unpublished) (finding that once the Immigration Judge held that the alien’s motion, filed more than four years after the 1999 removal order, was untimely, his discussion of the existence vel non of exceptional circumstances was unnecessary, and any error he may have committed on that score is therefore harmless).
 
Moreover, regarding the respondent’s claimed fear of persecution or torture in El Salvador, the regulations provide specific procedures through which an alien subject to reinstatement may pursue such a claim.1 See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.31, 1241.8(e) (describing procedures for those subject to reinstatement who expresses fear of returning to country of removal); Matter of W-C-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 118, 123 (BIA 2007) (denying motion to remand, noting that procedures are in place for those subject to reinstatement who claimed a fear of returning to country of removal); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1241.8(a)(1) (an immigration officer is required to determine whether “the alien is in fact an alien ...”). The respondent may pursue these applications in such proceedings.
 
Contrary to the Immigration Judge’s finding otherwise, the respondent is not barred by section 241(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5), from filing a motion to reopen in absentia proceedings when alleging a lack of notice. See Matter of Bulnes, 25 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 2009) (Board held that an alien’s departure from the United States while under an outstanding order of deportation or removal issued in absentia does not deprive the Immigration Judge of jurisdiction to entertain a motion to reopen to rescind the order if the motion is premised on lack of notice). Given our findings above, however, we find no prejudicial error.
 
*4 Finally, as noted above, the respondent proffers evidence on appeal. Even if we were to construe the respondent’s additional evidence as a motion to remand, the respondent has not shown that this evidence is new or previously unavailable, or that it could possibly alter the decision in this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (holding that a party who seeks a remand to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case). Therefore, we find that a remand is not warranted.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David Swaim, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied. This case was last before the Board on October 23, 2015, when the Board, finding that the respondent knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal, dismissed the respondent’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. On April 18, 2016, the respondent filed the present motion. However, the motion is untimely filed and has not been shown to qualify for any exception to the time limitations imposed by law on motions to reopen removal proceedings. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
Moreover, we decline to equitably toll the applicable time limits based on the respondent’s alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel(s) claim. The evidence proffered along with the respondent’s motion does not sufficiently demonstrate that further hearings on his asserted eligibility for adjustment of status are warranted. See also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-74 (BIA 1992) (recognizing that the respondent bears a “heavy burden” of demonstrating that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case). To date, only minimal evidence of the bona fides of the respondent’s current marriage, which was entered into during the pendency of these removal proceedings, has been proffered and there is no evidence that the respondent’s I-130 has been approved.
 
On this record we do not find that the respondent has sufficiently demonstrated patent error or prejudice stemming from former counsel(s) alleged deficient performance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001) (noting that to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate that counsel’s performance resulted in substantial prejudice); Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F. 3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994) (proving prejudice requires that the petitioner make a prima facie showing that, absent counsel’s deficient performance, he would have been entitled to the relief the sought). Nor are we persuaded that reconsideration of the prior Board decision or reopening of these proceedings is warranted in the exercise of discretion under the Board’s sua sponte authority. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied as untimely filed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Damian J. Miklosovic, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Wylly Jordan
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 15, 2014, denying her motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for her failure to appear for the hearing on March 19, 2002. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to credibility determinations and the likelihood of future events, under a “““clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review all other issues, including questions of law, judgment, or discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record reflects that on January 10, 1999, the respondent’s mother was served with the Notice to Appear on behalf of the respondent, who was a minor at the time (Exhs. 1, 3). See Matter of Gomez-Gomez, 23 I&N Dec. 522 (BIA 2002) (finding that the Service had met its burden of proving a minor respondent’s removability where the father of an 8-year-old respondent signed the child’s Notice to Appear and furnished data on the Form I-213). The respondent’s mother received oral and written notice in the Spanish language of the consequences of a failure to appear and of the requirement to notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever she changed her address or telephone number during the proceeding (Exh. 1). The respondent did not appear for the hearing on March 19, 2002, and the Immigration Judge issued an in absentia order of removal.
 
An alien may not be entitled to receive notice of her hearing if she does not provide an address at which she may be contacted during proceedings. See section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(B) (eliminating the notice requirement where the alien fails to provide the required contact information); see also Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674-75 (BIA 2008) (stating that an alien must comply with the statutory responsibility to provide current address information).
 
Upon de novo review, we affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. He acknowledged the respondent’s contention in her motion to reopen that she was eight years old and living with her mother when the notice of hearing was issued, and her mother never told her about a letter or an immigration hearing (I.J. Dec. at 2; Exh. 2). The notice of hearing was sent to the respondent’s last known address, but it was returned to the Immigration Court as undeliverable, stamped with the notation “Not Deliverable as Addressed, Unable to Forward.” We agree with the Immigration Judge that this evidence indicates either the address provided by the respondent’s mother was inaccurate, or the respondent and her mother moved without notifying the court (I.J. Dec. at 2-3; Exh. 3). Consequently, the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent received proper notice of her hearing. See United States v. Zelaya, 293 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir. 2012) (holding that mailing a notice to the last known address is sufficient to satisfy the government’s duty to provide an alien with notice of a removal hearing).
 
*2 On appeal the respondent requests that her case be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further consideration. However, the respondent has not submitted any evidence that she is eligible to apply for any relief, nor has she submitted any applications for relief. To the extent the respondent’s appeal implies that the attorney who assisted her in filing a motion to reopen provided ineffective assistance of counsel, she has failed to establish such a claim. The respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as enunciated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Consequently, the respondent has not submitted any evidence to address the issue further.
 
The respondent also states that she was the victim of abuse at different times in her life, and she is distressed at the prospect of returning to Honduras with her children, as crime and violence are rampant there. The time and number limits for motions to reopen do not apply to a motion to reopen proceedings if the basis of the motion is to apply or reapply for asylum or withholding of removal based on changed country conditions or changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); 1003.23(b)(4)(i); see also Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013) (holding that proceedings conducted in absentia may be reopened where the alien seeks asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions). However, the respondent has not submitted an asylum application, she does not allege or discuss any changed country conditions in Honduras to support her claim, and she has not presented any evidence of a change in country conditions which is material to her claim for asylum. Therefore, the respondent is not exempt from the 90-day time limitation because she has not shown that it is based on changed country conditions arising in Honduras since the date of her removal order. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i).
 
We further find no basis for exercising our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings in this case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John J. Garzon, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s October 22, 2014, decision ordering the respondent removed from the United States to El Salvador. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed, pursuant to this Board’s authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5), for the reasons set forth therein, and the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3(i), (ii), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. On appeal, the respondent contends that his prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance and that the Immigration Judge should have continued the respondent’s October 22, 2014, hearing based upon prior counsel’s stated desire to withdraw from representing the respondent.
 
The averments of respondent’s counsel on appeal that are not present in the record are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (statements of counsel in a brief are not evidence). Furthermore, the respondent’s claim, through counsel, that prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance has not been established. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the general criteria for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
Finally, prior counsel’s effort to withdraw, standing alone did not establish good cause for a continuance of the respondent’s removal proceeding pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29 where the record establishes that the respondent and prior counsel were aware of the scheduled hearing and the obligation to be prepared to proceed with any application for relief before the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 5-9, 11-22). In this regard, prior counsel indicated on the record that pursuing voluntary departure and withholding of removal were also being considered but were not pursued. Also, at the final hearing, respondent’s prior counsel informed the Immigration Judge that the respondent was aware of his options. Thus, good cause to continue the respondent’s hearing did not exist as the respondent had notice of the timing and purpose of the hearing and did not comply with the deadline for submission of applications set by the Immigration Judge, thereby abandoning any application for relief from removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). On appeal, the respondent does not indicate what relief he is seeking or what he was prevented from presenting to the Immigration Court. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Kathryn E. Shepherd, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christopher Coxe
Deputy Chief Counsel
*1 The respondents are natives and citizens of Guatemala who were placed in removal proceedings. Represented by counsel, they requested an order of removal, and did not request any relief from removal. On April 5, 2016, the Immigration Judge issued an order of removal against the respondents. The order indicated that no other application for relief was requested, and that the appeal was waived.
 
The respondents did not file a timely Notice of Appeal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38 (Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision). The Department of Homeland Security represents that the respondents were detained on or about May 16, 2014. Thereafter, on May 24, 2016, the respondents filed a Notice of Appeal, as well as a request for a stay. Since the Notice of Appeal was filed after expiration of the 30 day time limit for filing a Notice of Appeal, the appeal is untimely.1
 
The respondents request that we accept the untimely appeal on certification, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), and remand the record because the respondents’ former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondents have not complied with Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondents assert that they wanted to file for asylum but their attorney did not comply with their request. However, their former attorney has not been notified of this claim, or been given an opportunity to respond.
 
The respondents also contend that permitting them to file an untimely Notice of Appeal would be a reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The respondents have not demonstrated any specific disabilities applicable to them, or further demonstrated that the Rehabilitation Act specifically applies to them. Given these circumstances, we decline to accept the appeal on certification. The request for a stay is denied as moot.
 
Since we find that the appeal is untimely, the Immigration Judge’s decision is accordingly now final, and the record will be returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.

The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review issues of law, discretion, or judgment de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the motion to reopen and reconsider were untimely filed (IJ at 3). See sections 240(c)(6) and (7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6) and (7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1). Further, the respondent has not demonstrated that any exception to the time limitation on reopening applies. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4). On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in declining to exercise his discretionary sua sponte authority to reopen and/or reconsider his final order of removal. We agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the motions.
 
We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s discretionary denial of reopening for the reasons set forth in his decision denying reopening (IJ at 3-5). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent requested sua sponte reopening so that DHS may exercise its prosecutorial discretion (Motion to Reopen Sua Sponte filed 4/8/15). The DHS has not indicated that it will exercise its prosecutorial discretion in this case, and neither the Immigration Judge nor the Board have the authority to order DHS to do so. Further, the relief that the respondent seeks from DHS may not be available. See United States v. Texas, -- S.Ct.--, 2016 WL 3434401 (June 23, 2016), aff’g, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015). Since the respondent did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances for reopening proceedings, the Immigration Judge did not err in declining to exercise his discretionary sua sponte authority to reopen.
 
We also find no error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of reconsideration as moot (IJ Dec. dated 6/4/15 at 5). During proceedings before the Immigration Judge, the respondent, through counsel, admitted that he was not a citizen of the United States, that he was a citizen of Mexico, that he entered the United States illegally, and that he was removable as charged (Exh. 1; IJ Dec. dated 6/4/15 at 2, 4; IJ Order dated 10/20/14). His concession of removability was a condition precedent for the only relief he sought See section 240B(a)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i). Based on the respondent’s concessions, inter alia, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent the right to voluntarily depart within 120 days of the issuance of his order. Since the respondent did not voluntarily depart, the Immigration Judge’s order converted to an order of removal effective as of October 20, 2014.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent does not dispute the Immigration Judge’s finding as to alienage. Rather, the respondent argues, as he did in his motion to reconsider, that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated during a stop, which subsequently brought him to the attention of DHS and caused him to be placed in proceedings (Motion to Reconsider filed 3/19/15).1 The respondent contends, as he did before the Immigration Judge, that equitable tolling applies because he pursued his rights diligently and some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way (Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 8-11). The respondent argues that he was not aware of the constitutional violation of his rights until he spoke to his new lawyer.
 
Evidence obtained as a result of a Fourth Amendment violation is suppressible in the course of a civil deportation proceeding only if the violation is egregious or undermines the reliability of the evidence in dispute. See Almeida-Amoral v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 231, 235 (2d Cir. 2006); see also INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1050-51 (1984). An individual in removal proceedings who raises a question about the admissibility of evidence must come forward with proof establishing a prima facie case before the Government will be called on to assume the burden of justifying the manner in which it obtained the evidence. Cotzojay v. Holder, 725 F.3d 172, 178 (2d Cir. 2013).
 
Here, the respondent did not submit a signed, dated affidavit in support of his assertions (IJ Dec. dated 10/20/14 at 4 n. 1). See Motion to Reconsider Sua Sponte at pp. 23-24 (26-27). Moreover, it is well settled that arguments of counsel are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980). As such, the respondent did not meet his burden of proving a prima facie case. Cotzojay v. Holder, supra.
 
Even assuming, purely for the sake of argument, that the information was obtained through an egregious constitutional violation, the respondent’s alienage was established through means independent of any evidence of the stop he wished to suppress. See Vanegas-Ramirez v. Holder, 768 F.3d 226, 236 (2d Cir. 2014) (an alien’s concessions of removability are not fruit of the illegality, but an intervening act of free will); Pretzantzin v. Holder, 736 F.3d 641, 651 (2d Cir. 2013) (evidence of alienage is admissible if obtained through means independent of or sufficiently attenuated from the primary illegality).
 
The Immigration Judge found, and the respondent does not dispute on appeal, that the respondent admitted during his removal proceeding that he was not a citizen or national of the United States and was a native and citizen of Mexico (IJ Dec. dated 6/4/15 at 2, 4). The respondent conceded alienage about two years after the date of the alleged violations, with the assistance of counsel.2 As a result, the concession of alienage was sufficiently independent of any violation that may have previously occurred. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge correctly denied the motion to reconsider sua sponte as moot and the appeal shall be dismissed.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jason A. Nielson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William M. Hunt
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s motion is untimely filed and is denied on that basis. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The motion has not been shown to satisfy any exception to the time limitations imposed by law on motions to reopen removal proceedings. Further, untimely motions to reopen to apply for adjustment do not fall within any statutory or regulatory exception to the time limits on motions and generally will be denied. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 105 (BIA 2009).
 
Moreover, we decline to equitably toll the applicable time limits based on the respondent’s asserted ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for advancing such a claim, or the requirement that he show prejudice resulting from former counsel’s alleged deficient performance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). Further, the respondent does not dispute that at the very least, he was aware of the Board’s February 7, 2012, decision approximately 3 months after the decision was issued. Other than hire current counsel, for which the respondent provides no dates or details, the respondent has not offered a persuasive explanation for waiting more than 4 years to file the present motion.
 
On this record, the respondent has not provided an adequate basis to excuse the untimeliness of the present motion. Nor has he demonstrated an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretion to reopen his proceedings under our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “[t]he power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

File: AXXX XX6 569 - Atlanta, Georgia

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hiba Ghalib, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of South Korea, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 24, 2016, denying his motion to reopen the removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, and the likelihood of future events, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record reflects that the respondent and his attorney appeared at a continued Master Calendar hearing on November 5, 2015. Based on the respondent’s admissions and concession of removability (Exh. 2) entered at the May 15, 2015, hearing, the Immigration Judge entered an order granting the respondent’s request for pre-conclusion voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), with an alternate order of removal if he failed to depart on or before March 4, 2016. However, the respondent failed to voluntarily depart by the March 4, 2016, deadline. Instead, on March 4, 2016, he filed a motion alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, and seeking reopening in order to apply for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, 8 C.F.R. § 1255, based on his recent marriage to a United States citizen who had filed an immediate relative immigrant visa petition (Form I-130) on his behalf.
 
The record includes a document (Exh. 3) explaining the conditions attendant to the grant of the request for pre-conclusion voluntary departure, including the waiver of appeal, signed by both the respondent and his attorney on November 5, 2015, indicating their understanding and acceptance of the terms of the agreement. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i). The Immigration Judge’s November 5, 2015, decision became an administratively final order on that date when the respondent agreed to the terms of the grant of pre-conclusion voluntary departure, waived appeal and accepted that decision as final. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.14 and 1003.39.
 
*2 With certain limited exceptions, an alien is permitted to file one motion to reopen a final administrative order of removal, not later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent filed his motion to reopen on March 4, 2016, more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s administratively final order entered on November 5, 2015. Thus, the Immigration Judge properly denied the motion as time-barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
Moreover, to the extent that respondent is arguing that his legal representation before the Immigration Court was deficient, we agree with the Immigration Judge (3-4) that the respondent has not satisfied the procedural requirements for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); accord Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir. 2003). Notwithstanding, even if we were to find the respondent had complied with the Lozada requirements, in order to establish ineffective assistance of prior counsel, the respondent must establish that his former counsel’s performance was so deficient that it impinged the “fundamental fairness” of the hearing and he suffered prejudice thereby. See Ali v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 643 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir. 2011) (alien must establish prejudice in order to prevail on ineffective assistance claim), citing Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, 178 F.3d 1139, 1146 (11th Cir.1999); see also Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273-74 (11th Cir.2005) (“Prejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.”); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (establishing ineffective assistance of counsel requires an alien to demonstrate prejudice from counsel’s conduct, such that it compromised the fundamental fairness of the hearing). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, supra at 561. Here, no such prejudice has been shown.
 
Although the respondent now claims prejudice in that he would not have agreed to the grant of voluntary departure, if he had known he had other options, he does not identify in his motion what were those other options. Rather, the record reflects respondent’s former counsel elected to pursue the only apparent form of relief from removal then available to the respondent, pre-conclusion voluntary departure. An attorney’s tactical decisions in the preparation and presentation of an alien’s case, including accepting an extended period of voluntary departure, do not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel. See, e.g., Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 934 (9th Cir. 1986). We find no violation of due process or a denial of a fair hearing, as the respondent, represented by counsel, had ample opportunity to meet with him; and prepare for and present his case before the Immigration Court.
 
*3 Further, while an Immigration Judge retains limited discretionary authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte in “exceptional situations,” see Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997), we agree with the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 4-5) that the respondent’s motion presented no such situation.
 
Therefore, in light of the foregoing, we find that the Immigration Judge was correct in denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. Finally, in view of our disposition, the respondent’s request for a stay of removal will be denied. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion for a stay of removal is denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph A. Baker, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Hilary Rainone
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia, appeals from the May 19, 2015, decision of the Immigration Judge denying a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including those on credibility, for clear error, and review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues on appeal on a de novo basis. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
The respondent was granted multiple continuances to await a decision on his application for deferred status pursuant to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) which was ultimately denied. At his hearing before the Immigration Judge in May 2015, the respondent requested a further continuance to file a motion to vacate a criminal conviction. However, the pursuit of post-conviction relief does not constitute good cause to delay proceedings since the outcome of such an endeavor would be speculative, and a conviction is considered final for immigration purposes unless and until it is overturned. See Matter of Cuellar, 25 I&N Dec. 850, 855 (BIA 2012); Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987) (the decision to grant or deny a continuance for good cause is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge and will not be overturned on appeal unless it is shown that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6. Therefore, we find no error in the decision of the Immigration Judge to deny the respondent’s motion for a further continuance. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
To the extent that the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in his removal proceeding, we find that he has failed to substantially comply with the procedural requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). By the respondent’s own admission, he has taken only initial steps to file a formal complaint with the state bar where his prior counsel is licensed (Brief at 4). Furthermore, former counsel’s alleged failure to file a motion in state court regarding the respondent’s criminal conviction is not relevant to these removal proceedings. We thus find that he has not established that prior counsel’s representation resulted in the prejudice necessary to prevail on such a claim. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Accordingly, the motion to remand will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Margaret W. Wong, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Hana A. Sato
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India who was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on July 14, 2005, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge dated July 1, 2015, denying her motion to reopen. The respondent has filed an appeal brief, as well as a supplemental brief with additional evidence and argument, which we have construed as a motion to remand. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has expressed opposition to the appeal and the motion. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and her motion will be denied.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
An in absentia order of removal may be rescinded only where (1) the alien files a motion to reopen within 180 days of the date of the order of removal and demonstrates that the failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1), or (2) at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) and (2) of the Act, or was in Federal or State custody and the failure to appear was through no fault of the respondent. See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i)-(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 722-23 (BIA 1999).
 
Proper notification under section 239(a)(1) of the Act includes informing an alien of the time and place for his or her scheduled appearance before an Immigration Judge. See section 239(a)(1)(G)(i) of the Act. Where a hearing notice is properly addressed and sent by regular mail according to normal office procedures, a presumption of delivery attaches, although it is weaker than the presumption that applies to documents sent by certified mail. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 671-73 (BIA 2008). Additionally, a hearing notice is properly served on an alien if served on the alien’s counsel of record. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; see also Garcia v. INS, 222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
In her motion, which she filed on March 13, 2015, the respondent sought reopening of her proceedings on the basis of lack of notice. Specifically, the respondent alleged that she received no notice of her July 14, 2005, hearing, which demonstrated inadequate representation by her former counsel preventing her from having an opportunity to present her case. The respondent also alleged in her motion that the consequences for failing to appear at her hearing were not adequately represented to her at any time after her proceedings were initiated because the warnings in the Notice to Appear were given in a language that she barely spoke (Hindi) and she did not speak, write, or read English in 2005.1 She further alleged that her former attorney’s assertion (per the tape recordings of her in absentia hearing) that he informed her of her hearing date was not true as she never heard from her attorney after she last saw him at her bond hearing. According to the respondent, she first learned of her removal order in March or April 2013 after she hired an attorney to help her look into her immigration status and she never saw a copy of the in absentia removal order until her current attorney, with whom she started speaking in July 2014, showed it to her (Respondent’s Motion at 1-9 and Tab B, Affidavit).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge failed to consider whether she overcame the presumption of receipt under Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008), and instead simply concluded that she received proper notice because the Notice of Hearing (“NOH”) was sent to her attorney, without addressing her allegations regarding lack of notice (Respondent’s Brief at 4-7). The respondent also argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge completely ignored her contentions that her former counsel’s actions were shockingly inadequate and his performance so prejudicial as to warrant [a finding of] ineffective assistance. She asserts that she has a lack of understanding of the terms of her agreement with her former counsel and that she never filed a complaint against him but argues that, because she never signed an agreement with her former counsel, she should not be held to the same strict compliance [requirements] of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), as an individual who personally hired and signed an agreement with her attorney (Id. at 7-9).
 
The respondent also challenges on appeal the Immigration Judge’s finding that, by filing her motion almost 10 years after she was ordered removed in absentia, she did not demonstrate due diligence. According to the respondent, the delay was not unreasonable as she diligently pursued relief “since she discovered the circumstances of her claim” (Id. at 9-11). Finally, the respondent argues that sua sponte reopening of her proceedings is warranted because she intends to seek a provisional waiver, followed by a request for lawful permanent residence through consular processing, based on an approved visa petition; she is the primary caretaker of her United States citizen husband, who lost his right eye in 2000 and has had four eye surgeries in 14 years, as well as of their two United States citizen children; and, as a person of good moral character with no criminal record, is not a priority for removal under the DHS’s current guidelines (Id. at 11-13).
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s appellate arguments and we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision for the reasons stated in the decision (I.J. at 1-5). The respondent has not alleged that the NOH was not delivered as mailed and there are no indications on this record that that notice did not reach the respondent’s former attorney. Thus, as there is no question that the presumption of delivery attaches (section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act), the respondent’s argument that she did not receive notice of her hearing does not support a claim for reopening (Id. at 2-3).
 
Additionally, the respondent did not file her motion within 180 days of her removal order nor establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel so as to obtain equitable tolling of the filing deadline (Id. at 3-4). We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). Precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this case arises, provides that while the requirements of Lozada are generally reasonable, they need not be rigidly enforced where their purpose is fully served by other means (I.J. at 4). See Correa-Rivera v. Holder, 706 F.3d 1128, 1131 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002)); see also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (“Lozada is intended to ensure both that an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one”).
 
*3 We agree with the Immigration Judge that the general statements proffered by the respondent in her motion do not provide a clear indication of ineffective assistance of counsel and that the respondent has not complied with any of the Lozada requirements. First, the respondent’s affidavit does not detail the agreement that was entered into with her former counsel. Instead, it offers a vague reference of the nature of the respondent’s agreement with her attorney. Second, the respondent has conceded that she has not informed her former counsel of the allegations she has made against him, which has prevented that counsel from having an opportunity to respond to those allegations. Third, the respondent has not filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority against her former counsel or explained why such a complaint has not been filed (Id. at 3).
 
We further agree with the Immigration Judge that the evidence in this case shows a lack of due diligence by the respondent. The respondent could have discovered her former counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness when she hired her second attorney in March or April 2013 or, at the latest, in July 2014, when she spoke with her current attorney about the documents she has obtained pursuant to a FOIA request, yet she filed her motion in May 2015 (Id. at 4).
 
We find that, under the circumstances of this case, the respondent has not established a basis to rescind the Immigration Judge’s in absentia removal order and reopen her proceedings.
 
We also find that the respondent has not established that sua sponte reopening of these proceedings is warranted. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We do not find that the information provided by the respondent in this regard establishes that her case presents a truly exceptional situation warranting reopening.
 
In her motion, the respondent asks that we consider one of our unpublished decisions, dated June 25, 2015, in which we issued a remand after concluding that administrative closure to allow the alien to pursue an I-601 provisional waiver application may constitute relief for purposes of reopening. We will deny the motion for the reasons stated by the DHS in its brief opposing the respondent’s motion. See DHS’s brief titled “Department’s Opposition to the Respondent’s ‘Supplement to Respondent’s Brief in Support of Appeal.”DD’ First, the respondent’s submission, which was received after the September 17, 2015, deadline we set when we granted a briefing extension request on August 27, 2015, does not comply with the Board Practice Manual’s requirement that a brief filed outside the period granted in a briefing schedule be accompanied by a Motion to Accept Supplemental Brief that complies generally with the rules for motions, including service on the opposing party. See Board Practice Manual, section 4.7(g). Second, the respondent is asking the Board to rely on an unpublished decision, which has no precedential value. Third, even if we were to consider the non-precedential decision submitted with the motion, the circumstances in that case are very different from those in the instant case, particularly in that the motion in that case was timely filed. Thus, the respondent in the instant case is not similarly situated as the alien in our unpublished decision that he now seeks to have admitted into the record.
 
*4 Given the foregoing, we decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen and will deny the respondent’s motion to remand. Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Margaret W. Wong, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of June 19, 2015. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s June 10, 2015, motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on June 3, 2010. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The Notice of Hearing (NOH) for the June 3, 2010, hearing was mailed to the respondent’s former counsel, Barry Frager, Esquire, on December 16, 2009 (I.J. at 1; Exh. 3). The respondent failed to appear at his hearing and an in absentia order was entered on June 3, 2010. The respondent filed a motion to reopen in absentia proceedings through present counsel on June 10, 2015, alleging that he did not receive notice of his hearing. The motion further alleged that prior counsel failed to inform the respondent of his hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding reopening not warranted based upon lack of notice because notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent (I.J. at 2-3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
While the respondent alleges his counsel did not notify the respondent of his hearing date, the Immigration Judge properly found that the respondent has not shown ineffective assistance of counsel insofar as he has not complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988)(I.J. at 2-3). See Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857, 863 (6th Cir. 2006). We find without merit the respondent’s appellate contention that strict adherence to the Lozada requirements is not necessary (Respondent’s Brief, at 8), where the respondent has not explained his failure to fulfill any of the Lozada requirements. See Ibarra-Reina v. Lynch, __ F.3d __ No. 15-3395, 2016 WL 3212266, at 4 (6th Cir. June 7, 2016) (holding that although Lozada is not enforced rigidly, neither have requirements been as loosely applied as the alien suggests).1
 
*2 In Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998), the Board held that an alien may reopen for purposes of pursuing previously unavailable relief in circumstances where she was not given oral warnings in her native language of the consequences of failing to appear at a deportation hearing and where the motion complies with the general time limits governing motions to reopen. The motion is untimely, however, and thus reopening on this basis is not warranted.
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge that no exceptional circumstances have been presented to warrant sua sponte reopening (I.J. at 11). Pursuant to our holding in Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), the power to reopen sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). While the respondent has presented some positive factors and alleges hardship to his U.S. citizen spouse and children, these factors either individually or in the aggregate are not so exceptional as to trigger the limited authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte. Indeed, many aliens who have been present in the United States for a period of years have accumulated favorable equities subsequent to being ordered removed. See Matter of Bedford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000) (burden is on the movant to show exceptional circumstances).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We find meritless the respondent’s argument on appeal that the Immigration Judge failed to consider Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 675 (BIA 2008) (Respondent’s Brief, at 7). That decision is inapposite because the facts are distinguishable from the case here.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David Stoller, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alexandra Rivas
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. On August 18, 2014, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On April 14, 2016, he filed an untimely motion to reopen. The respondent alleges that the time limitation should be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent contends, inter alia, that his former counsel should have disputed the charges of removability more vigorously and that he should not have been treated as an arriving alien. The respondent further argues that due to intervening precedent, his conviction is no longer an aggravated felony and he is eligible for cancellation of removal.
 
The motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel is denied as the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Although he attached a copy of a complaint to bar counsel, the motion does not include any evidence that it was actually filed (Motion, Exh. E). Further, the respondent has not demonstrated due diligence. See Avila-Santoyo v. Att’y Gen., 713 F.3d 1357, 1363 n. 5 (11th Cir. 2013) (en banc). The respondent has been aware of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, since our August 18, 2014, decision, but he still has not demonstrated compliance.
 
We will, however, grant the motion to reopen under our discretionary sua sponte power due to intervening precedent. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Donawa v. Att’y Gen., 735 F.3d 1275 (11th Cir. 2013)(conviction under section 893.13(1)(a) of Florida law does not qualify as an aggravated felony under the “drug trafficking crime” clause of section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act). Accordingly, we will remand this proceeding for further consideration of whether the respondent is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

26 I. & N. Dec. 765 (BIA), Interim Decision 3865, 2016 WL 3538417
U.S. Department of Justice
Executive Office for Immigration Review
Board of Immigration Appeals
MATTER OF ANTONIO GOMEZ-BELTRAN, RESPONDENT
Decided June 27, 2016
**1 *765 An alien cannot establish good moral character under section 101(f)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)(6) (2012), if, during the period for which it is required, he or she gives false testimony under oath in proceedings before an Immigration Judge with the subjective intent of obtaining immigration benefits.
 
FOR RESPONDENT:
Marina N. Alexandrovich, Esquire
Tempe, Arizona
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY:
Brent Landis
Senior Attorney
BEFORE: Board Panel: MALPHRUS and CREPPY, Board Members; GELLER, Temporary Board Member.
MALPHRUS, Board Member:
In a decision dated October 3, 2012, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable on his own admissions under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (2012), as an alien who is present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, and denied his applications for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1) (2012), and voluntary departure. The respondent has appealed from that decision and has filed a motion to reopen and remand. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes both the respondent’s appeal and his motion. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion will be denied.1
  
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico who last entered the United States on January 1, 2007. On his application for cancellation of removal, the respondent claimed that he had only one conviction, which *766 was on January 9, 2009, for driving under the influence. However, when he testified before the Immigration Judge, the respondent at first stated that he had never been convicted of any criminal offense. He only acknowledged the conviction after being reminded by counsel that it was listed on his application. The respondent’s attorney then asked if he had “any other arrests or convictions anywhere in the world,” to which the respondent clearly answered, “No, sir.”
 
On cross-examination, the respondent initially reaffirmed his claim that he had no other arrests or convictions. After he repeatedly denied any further criminal activity, the DHS confronted him with a series of specific dates and offenses that the respondent had not disclosed on his application.2 Even after the DHS questioned the respondent about the first of these offenses, he did not correct his prior misrepresentation or voluntarily reveal the extent of his criminal history, waiting instead until the DHS asked him about each incident. The respondent eventually admitted five additional arrests or convictions that were not included in his application and were not disclosed during the hearing until the DHS confronted him with each one.
 
**2 The Immigration Judge found that the respondent gave false testimony regarding his criminal history at the hearing and determined that he was not credible. Based on the respondent’s false testimony, the Immigration Judge concluded that he lacked good moral character under section 101(f)(6) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)(6) (2012), and was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal and voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge also denied his applications for relief in the exercise of discretion.3
  
II. ANALYSIS
  
A. Good Moral Character
 
The respondent has the burden of establishing that he meets all applicable eligibility requirements for cancellation of removal and that he merits a grant of relief in the exercise of discretion. See section 240(c)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4) (2012); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d) (2016). To qualify for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, the respondent must establish, among other things, that he has been a person of *767 good moral character for at least 10 years immediately preceding the date of his application.4 Section 240A(b)(1)(B) of the Act.
 
Section 101(f)(6) of the Act provides that no person can establish good moral character if, during the period for which it is required, he or she “has given false testimony for the purpose of obtaining any benefits” under the Act. The term “testimony” in section 101(f)(6) is limited to oral statements made under oath. Matter of L-D-E-, 8 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1959) (holding that false statements in an application do not constitute testimony). The Supreme Court has determined that the statutory bar applies to any oral statements made under oath by a person who has a subjective intent to obtain immigration benefits, regardless of whether the misrepresentation is material. Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 780 (1988) (stating that section 101(f)(6) “denominates a person to be of bad moral character on account of having given false testimony if he has told even the most immaterial of lies with the subjective intent of obtaining immigration or naturalization benefits”).
 
Immigration court proceedings are adversarial in nature and are governed by formal rules of procedure, which include requiring the Immigration Judge to take witness testimony under oath at transcribed *768 hearings. Section 240(b)(1) of the Act; Jacinto v. INS, 208 F.3d 725, 732-33 (9th Cir. 2000); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.7(b), 1240.9 (2016). False statements made under oath during proceedings before an Immigration Judge may constitute false testimony within the meaning of section 101(f)(6) of the Act. See Phinpathya v. INS, 673 F.2d 1013, 1018-19 (9th Cir. 1981) (“Testimony means a statement made by a witness under oath for the purpose of establishing proof of a fact to a court or tribunal.”), rev’d on other grounds, 464 U.S. 183 (1984); Matter of Barcenas, 19 I&N Dec. 609, 612 (BIA 1988) (finding that an alien’s false statements at a deportation hearing rendered him ineligible for voluntary departure); cf. Ramos v. INS, 246 F.3d 1264, 1266 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that false statements made in an asylum examination are “false testimony”); Bernal v. INS, 154 F.3d 1020, 1023 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that false statements made under oath in a naturalization interview are “false testimony”).
 
**3 Truthful testimony and disclosures are critical to the effective operation of the immigration court system. In the asylum context, courts have noted that the process depends on the alien’s fundamental obligation to tell the truth. Martinez v. Holder, 557 F.3d 1059, 1065 (9th Cir. 2009) (stating that the “asylum process is ultimately an honor system” and that the major check on the system is not the “[Immigration Judge’s] scrutiny or the government’s fact checkers,” but is, instead, “the asylum seeker’s belief that he or she will be held to that oath”); Diallo v. Gonzales, 447 F.3d 1274, 1280 (10th Cir. 2006) (“Asylum seekers must be held accountable for the veracity of statements that they swear to under oath.”). The same principle applies to applications for cancellation of removal.
 
In this case, the respondent testified that he had only been convicted of a single offense in 2009, denied any further incidents, and then admitted five additional arrests or convictions when confronted with each one by the DHS during cross-examination. He claims that his testimony was not untruthful because he honestly answered questions regarding specific offenses and dates and that it only appeared inconsistent when he was asked “vague, open-ended questions.”5
 
We do not agree. The questions regarding criminal history on the cancellation of removal application and at the hearing were not vague; they were simple and direct. The respondent was asked about his criminal history several times during the hearing and was given ample opportunity to disclose all his arrests and convictions before he was confronted by the *769 DHS. There is no indication that he did not understand the questions.6 Cf. United States v. Hovsepian, 422 F.3d 883, 887-88 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc) (finding no subjective intent to deceive under section 101(f)(6) of the Act where inaccuracies resulted from poor memory, mistake, or vague questioning).
 
Nor was the interpretation of the proceedings in any way faulty. The respondent made no objection regarding the interpreter at the hearing, and he has made no showing on appeal that the interpreter did not perform competently. See Matter of D-R-, 25 I&N Dec. 445, 461-62 (BIA 2011); Matter of Exilus, 18 I&N Dec. 276, 280-81 (BIA 1982). The respondent claims that the interpreter mistakenly interpreted his date of birth as May 5, instead of May 14, but there is no indication that this discrepancy had any impact on his case. Furthermore, we find no merit to the respondent’s suggestion that the DHS may have questioned him about another person’s criminal record as a result of the incorrect birth date, because the respondent admitted each arrest or conviction referred to by the DHS. The remaining interpretation errors the respondent has identified were minor and unrelated to his false testimony. See Matter of D-R-, 25 I&N Dec. at 461-62.
 
**4 Although the respondent eventually answered questions truthfully when confronted with his criminal records, this does not undermine the fact that he made false statements when initially asked about his arrests and convictions. He did not fully and voluntarily disclose his criminal history and only admitted each arrest or conviction when specifically confronted with it by the DHS. See Ramos, 246 F.3d at 1266 (stating that the petitioner’s admission to lying did not preclude a finding that she lacked good moral character because ““her later honesty . . . does not remove her from the ambit of the statute”). Therefore, the respondent did not voluntarily make a timely recantation of his false testimony. Valadez-Munoz v. Holder, 623 F.3d 1304, 1310 (9th Cir. 2010) (stating that “when a person supposedly recants only when confronted with evidence of his prevarication, the amelioration [for recantation] is not available”); Matter of Namio, 14 I&N Dec. 412, 414 (BIA 1973).
 
When asked why he did not fully disclose his criminal activities, the respondent stated only that he “did not know.” The Immigration Judge did not err in rejecting this response as unpersuasive. The respondent’s *770 explanation raises a strong inference that he made false statements with the subjective intent to prevent the Immigration Judge from considering his criminal record in determining whether he is statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal and warrants such relief as a matter of discretion. See Akwasi Agyei v. Holder, 729 F.3d 6, 16 (1st Cir. 2013) (holding that the petitioner’s false testimony about his sham marriage warranted a finding that he lacked good moral character because his unexplained “fear” of telling the truth raised the “strong inference” that he was “afraid” he would be denied adjustment of status, which “is indistinguishable from a subjective intent to obtain immigration benefits via fraud”).
 
In determining whether the evidence is sufficient to establish that an applicant gave false testimony within the meaning of section 101(f)(6) of the Act, the trier of fact must conduct a case-by-case assessment. See Hovsepian, 422 F.3d at 887 (“Whether a person has the subjective intent to deceive in order to obtain immigration benefits is a question of fact.”); see also Siewe v. Gonzales, 480 F.3d 160, 167 (2d Cir. 2007) (“Drawing inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence is a routine and necessary task of any factfinder. . . . In the immigration context, the [Immigration Judge] is the factfinder to whom this indispensable work is delegated.”); accord Matter of D-R-, 25 I&N Dec. at 454. While not every misrepresentation or omission will be sufficient to constitute false testimony under section 101(f)(6) of the Act, this is not a close case. See generally Kungys, 485 U.S. at 781 (stating that the good moral character bar does not apply to mere ““concealments”).
 
**5 We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent actively sought to mislead the court regarding the extent of his criminal history when he only admitted his 2009 conviction and denied any others in responding to clear questions that called for full disclosure. Consequently, the Immigration Judge did not clearly err in finding that the respondent made false statements under oath with a “subjective intent to deceive” for the purpose of influencing the Immigration Judge’s decision regarding his applications for relief from removal. Id. at 780-81. We therefore conclude that the Immigration Judge properly held that the respondent is precluded from establishing good moral character under section 101(f)(6) of the Act and that he is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1)(B) of the Act and for voluntary departure.7
 
*771 Moreover, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent does not merit a favorable exercise of discretion on his applications for relief from removal. See section 240(c)(4)(A)(ii) of the Act. Based on our de novo review of the record, we conclude that the respondent’s equities, which include his long residence and family ties in the United States, are outweighed by his significant criminal history and his untruthfulness during the hearing. See Aragon-Salazar v. Holder, 769 F.3d 699, 706-07 (9th Cir. 2014) (stating that the Immigration Judge can consider an applicant’s lack of truthfulness during the hearing as part of the discretionary determination on an application for relief). Accordingly, we conclude that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s applications for cancellation of removal and voluntary departure, and we will dismiss his appeal.
  
B. Motion To Remand
 
The respondent’s motion was filed during the pendency of his appeal, so it is considered to be a motion to remand. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4) (2016); see also Matter of L-V-K-, 22 I&N Dec. 976, 978-80 (BIA 1999) (discussing differences between a motion to reopen and a motion to remand in the context of an appeal). We conclude that the respondent has not demonstrated that a remand is warranted based on his newly submitted evidence and allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992); see also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127, 138 (BIA 2009) (stating that the requirements for a motion to remand are essentially the same as those for a motion to reopen).
 
First, the respondent has not substantially complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 597-99 (9th Cir. 2004). Nor has he presented a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel,” as provided under Ninth Circuit law. Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (“Lozada is intended to ensure both that an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one.”). However, even if there had been substantial compliance, the respondent has not shown that his first attorney’s performance was deficient. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310-11 (BIA 1998).
 
**6 Contrary to the respondent’s assertions, prior counsel was aware that the respondent is the beneficiary of an approved visa petition. But since his priority date was not current and no visa was immediately available to him, the respondent was not eligible to adjust his status. Furthermore, administrative closure would not have been warranted because of the *772 remote availability of a visa and the speculative nature of the respondent’s ability to adjust his status, particularly in light of his false testimony and criminal history. See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688, 696 (BIA 2012).
 
In addition, we reject the respondent’s assertion that his prior counsel was ineffective because he did not discover or disclose the respondent’s complete criminal history. The respondent admitted that he misrepresented his criminal history to his first attorney, who stated that the respondent had only informed him of the 2009 offense. The responsibility for the respondent’s false testimony, and its consequences, therefore rests on his own shoulders.
 
We find no merit to the other arguments the respondent raised in his motion regarding his ineffective assistance claim. Therefore, because the respondent has not established that prior counsel’s performance was deficient or that it adversely affected the outcome of the proceedings, we find no basis for remanding. See Lianhua Jiang v. Holder, 754 F.3d 733, 741 (9th Cir. 2014) (finding no denial of due process where the alleged violation did not affect the outcome of the proceedings); Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 857-58 (9th Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (stating that prejudice must be shown to prevail on a due process claim based on ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
Finally, although the respondent claims that he is now eligible for additional relief from removal, he has neither submitted an application nor established prima facie eligibility for any such relief. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992) (stating that a motion to reopen is properly denied when a prima facie case for the relief sought has not been established); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

We note that the question on the cancellation application regarding the applicant’s criminal history is broadly worded to require full disclosure of all arrests and convictions.

We review the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including those relating to credibility, to determine if they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2016). We review de novo all questions of law, discretion, and judgment. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

The respondent’s false testimony occurred during the period in which he was required to establish good moral character. In Matter of Ortega-Cabrera, 23 I&N Dec. 793 (BIA 2005), we held that an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act is a continuing application for purposes of evaluating whether an applicant has established the required 10-year period of good moral character. In this case, the respondent provided false testimony before the Immigration Judge in June 2012, 2 years after his application was filed in May 2010, and 4 years prior to our current resolution of the matter.
In Castillo-Cruz v. Holder, 581 F.3d 1154, 1162 (9th Cir. 2009), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this case arises, cited Matter of Ortega-Cabrera and applied our approach to determining the period of good moral character for section 240A(b)(1) cancellation of removal. Moreover, other circuit courts have expressly deferred to our interpretation under Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Rodriguez-Avalos v. Holder, 788 F.3d 444, 452-55 (5th Cir. 2015); Duron-Ortiz v. Holder, 698 F.3d 523, 526-28 (7th Cir. 2012).
In Aragon-Salazar v. Holder, 769 F.3d 699, 706 n.4 (9th Cir. 2014), the Ninth Circuit held that an application for special rule cancellation of removal under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (“NACARA”), Pub. L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160, 2193 (1997), is not a continuing one for purposes of evaluating good moral character and that the required period of good moral character refers only to the 7 years immediately preceding the filing of the application. The court declined to follow Castillo-Cruz, finding that it arose “in a different context.” Id. We conclude that Castillo-Cruz continues to be controlling in the context of applications for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act.

The respondent may have been confused by the use of the term ““departure” during a line of questioning concerning his entries and departures. However, in finding that the respondent gave false testimony, the Immigration Judge did not appear to rely on this possible inconsistency, and we have not considered it in reviewing his decision.

6

The respondent was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings, and there were no indicia of incompetency. See Matter of M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 474, 477 (BIA 2011) (stating that “an alien is presumed to be competent” and that “absent indicia of mental incompetency, an Immigration Judge is under no obligation to analyze an alien’s competency”).

7

Since the respondent has not established good moral character, we need not address the Immigration Judge’s determination that he did not meet his burden to prove the requisite hardship under section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act. See INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25 (1976) (stating that “courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach”).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mary H. Berlanga, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s June 19, 2015, decision denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings held in absentia on May 14, 2015. The Department of Homeland Security has not opposed the appeal, which will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Upon de novo review, we affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. On appeal, the respondent reiterates that he did not receive notice of his hearing. He states that he did not receive a notice of hearing at the address he provided to the court, and therefore was unaware of the May 14, 2015, hearing. The record reflects that the Notice to Appear was served personally on the respondent on December 6, 2013, and that he received oral notice in the Spanish language and written notice of the the consequences of failing to appear at his removal hearings (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). On January 6, 2014, attorney Ronald Higgins entered an appearance on behalf of the respondent (I.J. at 1). On January 7, 2014, attorney Avia Castillo-Garza entered an appearance on behalf of the respondent (I.J. at 1). The Immigration Court mailed both Mr. Higgins and Ms. Castillo-Garza a hearing notice for the respondent’s May 14, 2015, removal hearing (I.J. at 1). There is no evidence in the record indicating that the notice of hearing was returned to the immigration court as undeliverable.
 
Based on the foregoing, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent received proper notice inasmuch as written notice of his hearing was provided to his attorneys of record. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (finding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (providing that whenever a person is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to the attorney or representative of record, or to the person himself if unrepresented). To the extent the respondent asserts that his former attorneys provided ineffective assistance of counsel, he did not establish such a claim. The respondent did not comply with the procedural requirements for filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as enunciated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 Moreover, to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for purposes of reopening, the respondent must demonstrate that he was substantially prejudiced by his former counsels’ performance. See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). Proving prejudice requires that the respondent make a prima facie showing that, absent counsels’ deficient performance, he would have been entitled to the relief he sought. See Miranda-Lores v. INS, 12 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994) (citation omitted). However, the respondent has not provided any applications for relief or established that he is prima facie eligible for any form of relief from removal. The fact of Mr. Higgins’s resignation of his law license does not, in and of itself, constitute ineffective assistance of counsel in this case such that the respondent suffered prejudice as a result of his representation.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Murray D. Hilts, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John D. Holliday
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 5, 2014, decision denying her motion to reopen removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, under a clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The following facts are not in dispute. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, entered the United States on or about May 1985 (I.J. at 1; Application for Cancellation of removal (Form EOIR-42A) at 2). The respondent was granted temporary resident status on February 1, 1989, and adjusted her status to that of lawful permanent resident (LPR) on March 5, 1993 (I.J. at 1; Exh. 2; Resp. Motion to Reopen at 24). On June 25, 1997, the respondent was issued a Notice to Appear charging her with removability under section 212(a)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C), as an alien the Attorney General knows or has reason to believe is an illicit trafficker in a controlled substance (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). On November 14, 1997, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and denied her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) (I.J. at 2; Order of the Immigration Judge, dated Nov. 14, 1997). The respondent did not appeal that decision (I.J. at 1). The respondent was removed to Mexico, and she unlawfully re-entered to the United States soon thereafter (Resp. Brief at 4).
 
On February 10, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, arguing that ineffective assistance of prior counsel prevented her from pursuing an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act (I.J. at 2; Resp.’s Motion to Reopen). Specifically, she asserts that under Ortega de Robles v. INS, 58 F.3d 1355 (9th Cir. 1995)--which held that an LPR could include time spent as a lawful temporary resident to establish the requisite 7 years of lawful unrelinquished domicile for former section 212(c) relief--she had established 7 years of continuous residence for section 240A(a) relief at the time of her removal hearing (Resp. Brief at 7-10). Her prior counsel’s “failure to keep abreast” of Ortega de Robles v. INS, supra, amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel (Resp. Brief at 7-10). The Immigration Judge denied reopening, concluding that the respondent had not shown that she was prejudiced by prior counsel’s assistance (I.J. at 3-4). See Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 587 (9th Cir. 2011); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, with the following notations. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). At the time of the respondent’s removal hearing in 1997, neither the Board nor the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had held that an LPR could include time spent as a lawful temporary resident to establish 7 years of continuous residence for cancellation of removal (I.J. at 4). The respondent’s reliance on Ortega de Robles v. INS, supra, is misplaced as that case addressed eligibility for former section 212(c) relief and was issued 2 years before cancellation of removal existed as a benefit. See Matter of Abdelghany, 26 I&N Dec. 254, 257 n.6 (BIA 2014) (explaining that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (effective April 1, 1997) eliminated former section 212(c) relief and created cancellation of removal). Thus, contrary to the respondent’s appellate assertion, there is no “““clear[] conflict” between Board precedent at the time of the respondent’s removal hearing and prior counsel’s concession that the respondent did not have the requisite 7 years of continuous residence (Resp. Brief at 10). As noted by the Immigration Judge, the Board did not hold that admission as a temporary resident could be counted toward the residency requirement for cancellation of removal until 2 years after the respondent’s removal hearing (I.J. at 4). See Matter of Perez, 22 I&N Dec. 689, 692 (BIA 1999).
 
The respondent argues that her prior counsel should have argued that the holding in Ortega de Robles v. INS, supra, regarding lawful domicile for former section 212(c) purposes applied to continuous residence for section 240A(a) purposes (Resp. Brief at 6-8). Given the unsettled nature of the law at that time of the respondent’s removal hearing, we agree that prior counsel did not commit ineffective assistance of counsel by conceding the respondent’s ineligibility for cancellation of removal (I.J. at 4-5). Moreover, we agree with the Immigration Judge that respondent did not establish prejudice, as the law was unsettled at that time. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899-90 (9th Cir. 2003) (explaining that prejudice results when “the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings”) (internal citation or quotation marks omitted).
 
Finally, considering the totality of the circumstances presented and alleged, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances sufficient to justify exercising his discretionary authority to reopen the respondent’s removal proceedings sua sponte (I.J. at 4-5; Resp. Brief at 10). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: JUAN BELTRAN ORTIZ
File: AXXX XX1 425 - Houston, TX
June 6, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a motion requesting the Board reconsider our decision of March 8, 2016, in which we affirmed the denial of his first untimely motion to reopen. The respondent also again seeks reopening with the submission of additional evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). As a motion to reconsider, this motion is timely filed. Insofar as the respondent seeks reopening, this motion is untimely and number-barred. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The record does not contain a response from the Department of Homeland Security. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must identify a material error of fact or law in the decision for which reconsideration is being requested. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). The respondent argues that his prior motion should have been construed as a “statutorily authorized” motion to reopen, notwithstanding that it was untimely filed. In support of this argument, the respondent relies on an interpretation of the term “sua sponte” which is limited to circumstances in which the Board chooses to reopen proceedings in the absence of a motion from the parties (Motion to Reconsider and Reopen at 6-11). He contends that if his motion was “statutorily authorized,” and not subject to reopening under “sua sponte” discretionary authority provided for in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), then the limitation on our discretionary authority in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) does not apply.
 
We are not persuaded of any material error in the Board’s decision of March 8, 2016. First, the respondent relies solely on a narrow reading of the phrase “““on its own motion” in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), which ignores the proviso that the Board may reopen “at any time.” The phrase “at any time” is inclusive of times when the Board is ruling on a motion from the parties. The respondent does not cite any authority for his interpretation of the Board’s authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Moreover, as the respondent acknowledges, the respondent’s interpretation directly contradicts not only Board precedent but also relevant circuit court authority (Motion at 9-11). See Ovalles v. Holder, 577 F.3d 288 (5th Cir. 2009); Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, 330 F.3d 672 (5th Cir. 2003); see also Garcia-Carias v. Holder, 697 F.3d 257, 265 (5th Cir. 2012).
 
*2 Further, the respondent ignores that on appeal the Board was not interpreting our own authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), but rather the Immigration Judge’s authority to do so under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). While these regulatory provisions are generally interpreted in an identical fashion with respect to sua sponte reopening, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) is explicit that an Immigration Judge’s authority to reopen sua sponte may be utilized “upon his or her own motion at any time, or upon motion of the Service or the alien” (emphasis added). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
Finally, if the respondent’s argument were accepted it would require the mandatory denial of his motion to reopen on the basis of untimeliness. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act contains an explicit timeliness limitation on motions to reopen. For those motions such as the respondent’s which do not fall within a statutorily authorized exception from the time limits, the regulatory authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte represents the sole mechanism by which the motion could be granted. For these reasons, the respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.
 
The respondent also seeks to present additional evidence to cure defects in the prior motion, and to that end this motion constitutes an untimely, second motion to reopen. Specifically, the Board previously noted that the respondent’s motion to remand on appeal did not comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent’s current motion seeks to remedy that deficiency by submitting evidence of compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
As alternatively noted by the Board in our decision of March 8, 2016, the respondent has not set forth a viable argument for ineffective assistance. The respondent has alleged equitable tolling was warranted because prior counsel did seek equitable tolling in the respondent’s first untimely motion. However, he has not explained why competent counsel would have sought equitable tolling in his first motion to reopen.1 Equitable tolling is ordinarily reserved for circumstances in which a party is actively misled or in which ineffective assistance of counsel prejudiced an alien and prevented a timely filing of an application or motion. See, e.g., Ott v. Johnson, 192 F.3d 510, 513 (5th Cir. 1999). The respondent, by contrast, was seeking reopening based on an intervening change in law, which does not constitute a basis for equitable tolling. See Matter of X-G-W-, 22 I&N Dec. 71 (BIA 1998); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999). To the extent that the respondent seeks sua sponte reopening based on an intervening change in law, we construe the departure bar in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) as a limitation on our discretionary authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte.
 
*3 Finally, we note that the respondent has not shown he would no longer be found removable even if we reopened proceedings. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). The respondent references United States v. Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d 921 (5th Cir. 2001), which did hold that convictions for driving under the influence do not establish removability for an aggravated felony crime of violence (Motion at 2-3). However, the respondent had also conceded removability under section 237(a)(2)(E)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), and the respondent does not allege that he is no longer removable on that basis.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

Respondent has submitted a letter from prior counsel which acknowledges that he did not seek equitable tolling in the first motion. However, the letter does not suggest prior counsel admitted to rendering ineffective assistance, as respondent claims, as the letter does not suggest that prior counsel was deficient for having not done so (Motion at 3-4; Motion, Tab A, at 7).
