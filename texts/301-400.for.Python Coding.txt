File: AXXX XX6 130 - Dallas, TX
October 22, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
J. David Swaim, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Zimbabwe, appeals the Immigration Judge’s October 4, 2012, decision denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent contends that he has submitted sufficient evidence to establish that his prior counsel, Ms. Cynthia K. Rigney, Esquire (formerly Cynthia K. Velarde), committed ineffective assistance by not reserving his right to appeal the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to continue proceedings on June 19, 2012 (Resp. Br. (11/05/12) at 2). He also argues that the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen violated his due process rights to a fundamentally fair proceeding (Resp. Br. at 4). Mr. J. David Swaim, Esquire, respondent’s current counsel before the Board, is the managing partner of the firm for which Ms. Rigney was employed when she was the respondent’s counsel of record before the Immigration Court in June 2012 (I.J. at 2).
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings as the respondent did not comply with the requirements to establish ineffective assistance by Ms. Rigney, and that the actions of Ms. Rigney did not constitute ineffective assistance (I.J. at 1-2). We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s October 4, 2012, decision. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994).
 
The respondent has not submitted a formal grievance with the appropriate state bar disciplinary authority regarding the performance of his prior counsel, and contends that such a formal grievance is not required to establish a claim of ineffective assistance (I.J. at 2; Resp. Br. at 10-11). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (an ineffective assistance claim should reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not). The filing of a state bar complaint, containing the notification of breaches of professional conduct, not only serves to deter meritless claims of ineffective representation but also highlights the standards which should be expected of attorneys who represent persons in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639-40; Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996), aff’d by Rivera v. INS, 122 F.3d 1062 (4th Cir. 1997). In Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 2014), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld a Board decision that denied a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel where the alien did not establish he had met all requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, supra. The Fifth Circuit explicitly considered precedents of the Ninth Circuit that found a claimant need not strictly comply with all the Matter of Lozada requirements to establish ineffective assistance. Id. The Fifth Circuit rejected the reasoning in these decisions and affirmed that compliance with the Matter of Lozada requirements was needed to demonstrate ineffective assistance. Id.
 
*2 We are not persuaded by the respondent’s explanations on appeal that a grievance to the Texas state bar is not required in the current case. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. The respondent has not established through objective evidence that he does not have the resources to pursue a disciplinary complaint against his former counsel (Resp. Br. at 12). In addition, the “““confidential” nature of disciplinary proceedings before the Texas state bar or the time it would take to resolve a claim are not valid excuses for failure to file the claim (Resp. Br. at 12). See Bouchikhi v. Holder, 676 F.3d 173, 180 (5th Cir. 2012).
 
Furthermore, the prior counsel’s tactical decision to waive appeal, after the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to continue to seek adjustment of status based on a third visa petition by the same spouse, which was contrary to the managing partner’s strategy for the case, does not indicate ineffective assistance (I.J. at 1-2; Motion to Reopen (08/13/12) at 2, item 10).1 See Morales v. Thaler, 714 F.3d 295, 305 (5th Cir. 2013), cert. denied 134 S. Ct. 393 (2013) (a counsel’s legitimate and reasonable tactical decisions, that may ultimately have an adverse effect on a client’s case, do not establish ineffective assistance). Moreover, the Immigration Judge, who the respondent and his prior counsel appeared before in June 2012, assessed the claims presented in the sworn statements and found that he was unable to conclude that Ms. Rigney disobeyed the respondent’s instructions (I.J. at 2; Resp. Br. at 8). See Matter of D-R-, 25 I&N Dec. 445, 454 (BIA 2011) (explaining that an Immigration Judge may make reasonable inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence in the record as a whole and is not required to accept a respondent’s account where other plausible views of the evidence are supported by the record).
 
The respondent contends that his former attorney’s actions were unreasonable as he had established good cause to warrant a grant of a continuance in order for his spouse to pursue a visa petition on his behalf (Resp. Br. at 7-9). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23. The spouse’s two previous visa petitions had been denied and there is no showing in the record to establish facts that would demonstrate that it is likely the third visa petition would be successful (I.J. at 1). See Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 790 (BIA 2009).
 
As the respondent has not met his burden to establish that Ms. Rigney provided ineffective assistance in June 2012, we need not address the respondent’s contentions that the denial of his motion to reopen has prejudiced his federal district court case against the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (“USCIS”) (Notice of Appeal, Attachment at 8-10). Moreover, the respondent’s contentions about the USCIS’s processing of visa petitions, and any actions of the federal court, are not within the purview of the Board to evaluate.
 
*3 Based on the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: JOSE GUADALUPE CABRERA-YURIAR
File: AXXX XX7 058 - San Diego, CA
October 21, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
J. Manuel Sanchez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kori LaPoint
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has filed an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 5, 2013, written decision denying his application voluntary departure as abandoned, cancelling a hearing scheduled for May 8, 2013, and ordering the respondent’s removal from the United States. The respondent has also filed, through his new counsel, a motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel. In response, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has moved for summary affirmance and expressed its opposition to the motion. We will dismiss the appeal and deny the motion.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. We find that the Immigration Judge properly determined that the respondent abandoned his opportunity to apply for relief from removal by not complying with the Immigration Judge’s November 14, 2012, order to file, no later than March 1, 2013, a written brief stating whether he was interested in seeking voluntary departure (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 15-16; Immigration Judge’s Record of Master Calendar Pre-Trial Appearance and Order, Form EOIR-55, dated November 14, 2012). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (providing that the Immigration Judge may set and extend time limits for the filing of applications for relief and that applications not filed within the time limit set by the Immigration Judge shall be deemed waived). The Board has long held that applications for benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act are properly denied as abandoned when the alien fails to timely file them. See Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547 (BIA 1992); see also Matter of Jean, 17 I&N Dec. 100 (BIA 1979), modified, Matter of R-R-, supra.
 
The respondent initially argued, when he filed his appeal brief through the same counsel who represented him before the Immigration Judge, that the Immigration Judge erred in not entertaining his previously submitted request for voluntary departure and that there was ambiguity in the instructions pertaining to the deadline imposed, which both parties understood was not for a request of voluntary departure, but for additional applications for relief (Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 2-10). We disagree. As argued by the DHS in its brief in response to the respondent’s appeal brief, the Immigration Judge’s instructions were clear and the DHS understood that the March 1, 2013, deadline was set for the respondent to decide whether he wanted to request voluntary departure (DHS’s Reply Brief at 1-2; Tr. at 15-16). Moreover, we note that the respondent, who is now represented by new counsel, seems to have withdrawn this particular argument as he now asserts that his prior counsel “failed to submit the written request for [v]oluntary [d]eparture,” resulting in the Immigration Judge’s determination that he “had abandoned my request for” such form of relief (Respondent’s Affidavit accompanying the Motion to Reopen, at 3; see also Motion to Reopen at 2, 6, 9).
 
*2 Given the foregoing, we decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s application for voluntary departure as abandoned because of the respondent’s noncompliance with the March 1, 2013, deadline set by the Immigration Judge in his November 14, 2012, order.
 
We will deny the respondent’s motion to remand. We agree with the DHS that the respondent has not complied with the requirement set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), of indicating whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate State bar and, if not, why not (DHS’s Opposition to the Respondent’s Motion to Remand at 1-2). Additionally, while the respondent has submitted proof that he informed his prior counsel of the allegations he is now making against him, we note that the date on that particular letter indicates that the letter was sent, at the latest, only four days prior to the respondent’s filing of his motion to remand. Thus, we are not satisfied that this communication suffices as proof that the respondent’s prior counsel was given an adequate opportunity to respond to the allegations being made against him. Also, while the respondent argues in his motion that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s failure to advise him that he could file an application for cancellation of removal, the respondent has not submitted such an application with his motion nor sufficiently identified the evidence that would establish that he is prima facie eligible for this or any other form of relief from removal. As such, we are unable to find that the respondent was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s handling of this matter. For these reasons, we will deny the respondent’s motion.
 
Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

IN RE: JUANA NIDIA RAMIREZ-DE MENDEZ A.K.A. JUANA NIDIA RAMIREZ PENA
File: AXXX XX1 699 - Boston, MA
September 25, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tony V. Blaize, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on May 25, 2005, when we dismissed as moot the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s May 3, 2004, decision. The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removable as charged after determining that the evidence of record overcame her claim to United States citizenship. See Immigration Judge’s Decision at 1, 5. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal, however, because after unsuccessful attempts to contact the respondent by mail, we deemed the appeal to have been abandoned. On June 2, 2014, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen. The respondent seeks reopening to apply for adjustment of status as the parent of a United States citizen. The motion is untimely by nearly 9 years and will be denied. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent does not claim, and it does not appear, that any exception to the filing deadline imposed on motions to reopen applies to her case. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 105 (BIA 2009) (emphasizing that untimely motions to reopen to apply for adjustment of status generally do not fall within any of the statutory or regulatory exceptions for motions to reopen and are generally denied); 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c)(3). Further, we are not persuaded to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen the proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (discussing the Board’s limited authority to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte in exceptional situations).
 
Insofar as the respondent now challenges the Immigration Judge’s decision, including the finding with regard to her alleged United States citizenship, we emphasize that such issues are deemed waived as the respondent was found to have abandoned her appeal. See generally Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191, 196, n.4 (BIA 1990) (noting that issues not addressed on appeal are deemed waived on appeal).
 
In her motion, the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel against Lawrence Perlmutter, the attorney who represented her before the Immigration Judge.1 See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (discussing ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the Board), affirmed, Lozada v. I.N.S., 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). She also claims that Lawrence Perlmutter represented her on appeal before the Board even though the Notice of Appeal was filed “pro se.”
 
*2 The respondent has offered evidence that in 2010, Mr. Perlmutter was charged in a Federal money-laundering case after being accused of conspiring to conceal illegal drug trafficking proceeds beginning in 2006. The respondent has not shown, however, that such activity was in any way related to Lawrence Perlmutter’s handling of her case. Further, although the respondent claims that her former attorney did not adequately prepare for her hearing because he did not secure witnesses and documentary evidence regarding her alleged United States citizenship, she has not offered any evidence with this motion in support of her citizenship claim. Further, with regard to her appeal, the respondent has not shown that the Board’s unsuccessful attempts to contact her with regard to her appeal were related to her former attorney’s handling of the appeal. Indeed, she has offered no explanation addressing why the Board’s attempts to contact her at her last address of record were unsuccessful. We are not persuaded, therefore, that Mr. Perlmutter’s allegedly deficient performance may have altered the outcome of her case. See Zeru v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 59, 72 (1st Cir. 2007) (stating that to succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, petitioners must show a reasonable probability of prejudice resulting from their former representation).
 
The respondent has also not shown that she exercised due diligence in bringing her ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board. See Bead v. Holder, 703 F.3d 591, 594 (1st Cir. 2013) (finding that the Board’s determination that an alien who sought reopening based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim had not diligently pursued his rights, as required for equitable tolling doctrine, was not abuse of discretion); Matter of Lozada, supra, 639. Although the respondent claims that she was unaware of the Board’s decision until she contacted her current attorney, she has not set forth any arguments or evidence of any attempt to contact her former attorney or this Board with regard to her appeal at any time following the filing of the Notice of Appeal on June 11, 2004.
 
In sum, we are not persuaded that equitable tolling or reopening sua sponte based on the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is warranted in this case. We acknowledge that the respondent desires to remain in the United States due to the status of her health. We emphasize, however, that we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999). The respondent’s case does not present any such exceptional situation. See Matter of J-J-, supra. Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
*3 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Emmanuel A. Fishelman, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Termination
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated December 14, 2012, denying her motion to withdraw her admission of alienage and admission of removability.1 The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a brief in opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision in this case. In denying the motion, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent, through counsel, admitted and conceded she was from Guatemala (I.J. at 2).2 The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent conceded she entered the United States without inspection in her asylum application (I.J. at 2).
 
The respondent contends that she had a valid “ineffective assistance of counsel” claim, and that she did not need to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) in a pretrial motion (Resp. Br. at 11-15). The respondent cites to Figeroa v. INS, 886 F.2d 76, 77-79 (4th Cir. 1989) in support of her argument. In citing to Figeroa, she asserts that like the respondent in Figeroa, she did not speak English, was not educated, and was unfamiliar with the procedures by which one could file a bar complaint (Resp. Br. at 13). We reject this argument inasmuch as the respondent was represented by counsel before the Immigration Judge who could have complied with the Lozada requirements. We also reject the respondent’s argument that the lawyer was “properly” focused on the respondent’s deportation case, and not on prosecuting a civil action or bar complaint against the respondent’s former attorney (Resp. Br. at 13-14).
 
We disagree with the respondent’s contention that concessions in a motion to change venue without the respondent’s consent should not be used (Resp. Br. at 17-18). The respondent has not cited to legal authority for her argument. To the degree that the respondent asserts that her attorney made the concession of removability in the motion to change venue without her consent, this argument is without merit inasmuch as the respondent has not complied with the Lozada requirements as described above.
 
*2 We disagree with the respondent’s contention that information in the respondent’s application of relief should not be used as a concession of alienage (Resp. Br. at 18). Although the respondent cited to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.11(e) for this proposition, the relevant section proscribes using an application to constitute a concession of alienage only in a case in which the alien does not admit her alienage. In this case, the respondent admitted her alienage in her motion to change venue.
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge did not consider whether the DHS violated 8 C.F.R. § 287.3. However, we note that the applicable DHS regulations listed under 8 C.F.R. § 287 expressly provide that they “do not, are not intended to, shall not be construed to, and may not be relied upon to create any rights, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any matter, civil or criminal.” 8 C.F.R. § 287.12; see also Navarro-Chalan v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing 8 C.F.R. § 287.11 (1995) and the current version at 8 C.F.R. § 287.12 to explain that even if DHS regulations were applicable in the alien’s matter and were in fact violated, the regulations by its own express terms do not confer any individual rights that may be enforced in any matter). Thus, DHS regulations are not enforceable by the respondents to seek termination of proceedings or to suppress evidence. Further, even when a regulatory violation occurs, termination of proceedings or suppression of evidence is not the proper remedy. See Arias v. Rogers, 676 F.2d 1139, 1143 (7th Cir. 1982) (“To give a person who has been illegally arrested total immunity from either criminal punishment or deportation is an excessive sanction for the illegal arrest.”); cf. United States v. Guzman-Padilla, 573 F.3d 865, 890 (9th Cir. 2009) (“the government’s violation of its own rules does not provide a basis for the suppression of evidence in a criminal action”); United States v. Ani, 138 F.3d 390, 392 (9th Cir. 1998) (“Absent a constitutional violation or a congressionally created remedy, violation of an agency regulation does not require suppression of the evidence.”).
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: SEDRICK KNIGHT
File: AXXX XX0 800 - New York, NY
August 29, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brian Figeroux, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider the Board’s decision of February 27, 2014, in which the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s first untimely motion to reopen. The respondent has also submitted additional evidence, and to that end this motion is in the style of the respondent’s second, untimely motion to reopen since the respondent’s final administrative decision of January 23, 2001. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent does not allege any specific errors of fact or law in the Board’s prior decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); see also Matter of 0-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (noting that a motion to reconsider is not a vehicle by which a party can request reopening by generally alleging error in the prior decision). The request for reconsideration is denied.
 
Insofar as the respondent reiterates his request for reopening, we are not persuaded that equitable tolling of the time and number limits on motions to reopen is warranted in this case. The time and number limits on motions may be tolled due to ineffective assistance of counsel, where competent counsel would have acted otherwise and that ineffective assistance prejudiced the alien. Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d 879, 882B83 (2d Cir. 1994). In addition, the alien must show due diligence in attempting to correct the error during “both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed.” Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 131-32 (2d Cir. 2008). Finally, the alien must substantially comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent alleges ineffective assistance surrounding the filing of a visa petition after he married his United States citizen spouse on May 2, 2001, and subsequent advice regarding when to reopen his removal proceedings (Motion at 2, 4). The alleged ineffective assistance did not prejudice the respondent, as even if an I-130 petition had been filed and approved the day of his marriage any motion to reopen would still have been filed outside the 90 day period for motions to reopen. As we conclude no prejudice has been shown, we do not address the respondent’s assertion that he has established due diligence in attempting to discover and correct the alleged errors by prior counsel.
 
*2 While the Board does have the discretionary authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte, that authority is reserved for rare, “exceptional” situations not present here. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). This motion to reopen will be denied as untimely and number-barred.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

*1 The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen his removal proceedings to allow him to apply to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) for a hardship waiver under section 216(c)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(A) [extreme hardship waiver]. In our March 18, 2014, decision we dismissed his appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 29, 2012, decision which found him removable and determined upon review that there was no good reason to disturb the USCIS’s denial of his application for a hardship waiver under section 216(c)(4)(B) of the Act [good faith marriage waiver]. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The Board does not have any authority to reopen proceedings to allow the respondent to apply for a hardship waiver under section 216(c)(4)(A) of the Act. We issued a final administrative decision on March 18, 2014. The regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1216.5(a)(2) provides, in pertinent part, that a conditional resident who is in removal proceedings may apply for the [hardship] waiver only until such time as there is a final [administrative] removal order. It is well established that regulations promulgated by the Attorney General are binding on the Board and Immigration Judges. Matter of Akram, 25 I&N Dec. 874, 880 (BIA 2012). There is thus no basis for us to grant reopening.
 
The respondent, however, alleges ineffective assistance of (present) counsel. In Matter of Compean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General directed the Board to continue to apply the previously established standards for reviewing motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel pending the outcome of a rulemaking process.
 
In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988), we set forth the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated in Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 597 (9th Cir. 2004) that the court presumes, as a general rule, that the Board does not abuse its discretion when it obligates aliens to satisfy the literal requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 The respondent does not show substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent does not present his sworn affidavit or declaration made under penalty of perjury, and thus does not meet the first requirement in Matter of Lozada, supra. Compliance with the second requirement is excused because counsel obviously knows about the respondent’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, as they are made against him.
 
The respondent does not meet the third requirement in that he did not file a complaint against counsel with the State Bar of California, and does not offer a satisfactory explanation of why no complaint was made. Counsel states in her June 17, 2014, declaration (Motion Exh. B) that she did not know that even while the renewal of the good faith marriage waiver was before the Immigration Judge, she could have filed on the respondent’s behalf another Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence (Form I-751) with the USCIS based on extreme hardship. While counsel states that she takes responsibility for the oversight, she does not indicate that she self-reported her alleged ineffective representation to the State Bar of California. See generally California Business and Professions Code section 6068(o) (duties of attorney).
 
When an alien retains prior counsel to pursue an argument of inadequacy of that same attorney, the reporting requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, are likely more meaningful. It is not for the attorney to decide the issues regarding her own prior conduct. The self-reporting requirement does not equate to an obvious need for discipline. The self-reporting requirement lets a state bar decide and puts the state bar on notice if there are further problems. We conclude that the respondent does not show substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, to allege ineffective assistance of (present) counsel. Cf Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 825 (9th Cir. 2003) (the failure to file a bar complaint is not fatal to the alien’s ineffective assistance claim where former counsel submitted a letter of self-report to the state bar; this self-reporting shows that the alien’s former counsel regarded his delinquency as a serious breach of services promised to his client).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Karen H. Pennington, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)] - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
 
Sec. 237(a)(3)(D), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(3)(D)] - False claim of United States citizenship
 
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Kenya, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 17, 2013, sustaining the charges of removability and denying his application for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision will be affirmed. On April 23, 2013, the respondent, through his former attorney, admitted all factual allegations contained in the Notice to Appear and conceded both charges of removability (Tr. at 3). Based on the respondent’s concession that he was removable pursuant to section 237(a)(3)(D) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(3)(D), the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status (I.J. at 2). On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not permitting him to withdraw his concession of removability under section 237(a)(3)(D) of the Act.
 
Absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made during a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity binds his client as a judicial admission. See Matter of Velazquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). In the instant case, the respondent’s admissions and concessions were formal and distinct and were made by the respondent’s former counsel in his professional capacity because they were made at a time when he was the respondent’s official attorney of record. Although the respondent asserts that he was not advised of the consequences of the concession of removability made on his behalf by his former attorney, he has not proffered any evidence to show that the concession was the result of unreasonable professional judgment or was so unfair that it has produced an unjust result.
 
*2 We are not persuaded by the respondent’s assertion that he should not be bound by the concession of his former attorney because it was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Br. at 4-7). In Mai v. Gonzalez, 473 F.3d 162, 473 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2006), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that an attorney’s concession of removability based on a false claim of United States citizenship that cut off all available avenues of relief to the alien constituted ineffective assistance of counsel for purposes of a motion to reopen based on Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 67 (BIA 1988). However, unlike the alien in Mai, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, and has not provided a persuasive reason for not doing so. Although the record reflects that the respondent’s former attorney was aware of the respondent’s allegations (Tr. at 10), the respondent has not provided an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with his former attorney or indicated whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding the allegations and we are not persuaded that former counsel’s awareness of the allegations obviates the need for such evidence (Respondent’s Br. at 6). See, e.g., Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-99 (5th Cir. 2006) (upholding the need to comply with the Lozada requirements). As such, the respondent has not demonstrated that his former attorney provided ineffective assistance in conceding removability under section 237(a)(3)(D) of the Act. Because the respondent has not established that the concession was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel or other egregious circumstances, the Immigration Judge properly denied his request to withdraw his concession of removability under section 237(a)(3)(D) of the Act.
 
In sustaining the charge of removability under section 237(a)(3)(D) of the Act and denying the respondent’s application for adjustment of status, the Immigration Judge relied solely on the respondent’s concession of removability (I.J. at 2). Consequently we do not reach the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge erred in admitting the Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification submitted by the DHS (Respondent’s Br. at 7-11; Exh. 2). But see Downs v. Holder, 2014 WL. 339 77 88 (8th Cir. July 14, 2014).
 
In light of the foregoing, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed. The following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patrick Uke, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alexandra R. Tinkham
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen and national of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 14, 2013. The Immigration Judge denied a request for a continuance and granted voluntary departure with an alternate order of removal from the United States. Neither party appealed the grant of voluntary departure. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 10Q3.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The record demonstrates that the Immigration Judge continued this case at the hearing on December 29, 2011, at which time the respondent was represented by an attorney, and at the hearings on January 17, 2012, January 30, 2012, and May 22, 2012, in which the respondent was acting pro se. At the hearing on May 22, 2012, the Immigration Judge gave the respondent another opportunity to complete the Form EOIR-42B he initially submitted to apply for cancellation of removal and clearly warned him that at the next hearing, if the application and any attachments were not ready, the application would be deemed abandoned or dismissed, pretermitted or denied. The Immigration Judge provided the respondent with another copy of the application for cancellation of removal (Tr. at 32).
 
At the next hearing on February 14, 2013, the respondent appeared with the above noted counsel, who requested more time to help the respondent complete the cancellation of removal form and also indicated that the respondent had informed him that he did not have a Notice to Appear (Tr. at 38-41). The respondent’s counsel indicated that the respondent initially met with the firm beginning the October prior to this hearing and that the respondent had claimed that he did not have a Notice to Appear (Tr. at 38-41). It was clarified at the hearing that the respondent acknowledged receipt of the Notice to Appear at the hearing on December 29, 2011 (Tr. at 41-42). The Immigration Judge deemed the submitted, incomplete application for cancellation of removal abandoned and also pretermitted and denied that application as incomplete. She further determined that any new application was deemed abandoned and dismissed (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 43, 45).
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge abused her discretion and denied him due process by the Immigration Judge by pretermitting, denying, dismissing and deeming his application for cancellation of removal abandoned. Further the respondent argues that he was denied the opportunity to have meaningful representation.
 
There is no indication that the respondent was denied the opportunity to obtain representation. The record indicates that he was represented at his first and last hearings. He was also given several continuances which provided him sufficient opportunity to obtain representation. It is unclear what the respondent is claiming when he argues that he was denied the opportunity to have “meaningful representation.” To the extent that the respondent may have attempted to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we find that he has failed to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5)(ii).
 
*2 The Board does not find that the Immigration Judge abused her discretion in denying another request for a continuance at the hearing on February 14, 2013. She clearly notified the respondent at the prior hearing that she was providing him with one final opportunity to complete the Form EOIR-42B, to apply for cancellation of removal, and if, at the next hearing, the application and attachments were not ready, the application would be deemed abandoned or dismissed, pretermitted or denied (Tr. at 32). The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge if good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; see also Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996); Matter of Silva-Rodriguez, 20 I&N Dec. 448 (BIA 1992); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). The Immigration Judge provided several prior continuances for the respondent to complete his application for cancellation of removal and she did not abuse her discretion in denying yet another request for a continuance to complete such an application.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
*3 WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

IN RE: MIGUEL TALLEDO-GARCIA
File: AXXX XX9 652 - Las Vegas, NV
August 21, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Astrid Guzman-Ugarte, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s February 26, 2013, decision denying his second motion to reopen. We will dismiss the appeal.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Peru. He was personally served with a Notice to Appear for removal proceedings, but the Notice did not specify the time and date of his hearing. On June 13, 2011, after the respondent was released from detention, a hearing notice was mailed to the address he provided upon his release, notifying him that he was scheduled for a removal hearing on February 27, 2012. That hearing notice was returned undelivered by the postal service due to “insufficient address.”
 
The respondent did not appear at his removal hearing, and the Immigration Judge entered an in absentia order of removal. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel but failing to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Immigration Judge denied that motion on July 31, 2012. The respondent did not learn the motion was denied until October 2012, after the appeal period had expired. The respondent filed a second motion to reopen, alleging ineffective assistance of both of his prior counsel. The Immigration Judge denied the motion as number-barred. That denial is the subject of this appeal.
 
An alien who is ordered removed in absentia can file only one motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The Immigration Judge, therefore, properly denied the respondent’s second motion. This holding resolves the issue presented in this appeal.
 
Nonetheless, given the respondent’s claim of double receipt of ineffective assistance of counsel and the fact that the respondent has amply addressed the issues raised in his first motion to reopen, we will review by certification the denial of the respondent’s first motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c).
 
*2 First, lack of receipt of the hearing notice is not a basis for reopening and rescinding the in absentia order. The respondent had actual notice of the hearing because, he claims, his attorney’s assistant called the Immigration Court and inquired about the date and time of the hearing. The record shows, however, that the respondent did not receive the Notice of Hearing that was mailed to him. It was returned as undeliverable due to “““insufficient address.” Section 239(a)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(2), allows service of the Notice of Hearing by regular mail. An alien is charged with receiving proper notice if the notice reaches the correct address but does not reach the alien. Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 189 (BIA 2001).
 
In this case, the record suggests the respondent bears responsibility for the Notice of Hearing being undeliverable. The Form I-830 indicates that the address reported by the respondent upon his release from detention did not include his apartment number (Exh. 2). A subsequent change of address form the respondent submitted indicates he moved from apartment 131 to apartment 173 at the address to which the Notice of Hearing was mailed. It, thus, appears likely that the respondent’s apparent failure to provide his apartment number is the reason the hearing notice was undeliverable due to “insufficient address.” Because the Notice of Hearing was properly mailed to the respondent’s address on file, the respondent’s failure to receive it does not provide an adequate basis for reopening and rescinding the in absentia removal order.
 
Second, the respondent did not sufficiently establish ineffective assistance of counsel. To warrant reopening based on the ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien should (1) submit an affidavit describing the alleged misconduct and detailing the agreement for representation, (2) provide former counsel with an opportunity to respond to the allegations, (3) indicate whether a bar complaint has been filed, and (4) demonstrate that he was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639-40. Neither of the respondent’s motions to reopen satisfied the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada
 
The failure to fully comply with the Lozada requirements will not bar consideration of the motion where ineffective assistance of counsel is clear from the record. Granados-Oseguera v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 993, 998 (9th Cir. 2006); see also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that ineffectiveness was clear on the face of the record where counsel failed to file application for relief). In this case, however, ineffective assistance of counsel is not apparent from the record.
 
*3 The respondent claims that he did not attend his removal hearing because he was told his counsel would attend and his presence was not needed. As the Immigration Judge observed, no counsel entered an appearance in the proceedings, and the respondent did not sufficiently establish that he had obtained counsel. The declaration submitted with his second motion to reopen asserts that he signed a contract with counsel for representation before the Immigration Court, but the respondent has not provided a copy of any such agreement nor asserted that he is unable to provide a copy (second motion to reopen at Tab HI). He does not describe any particular details of the agreement, other than that it was for representation before the Immigration Court. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639 (claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should include “a statement that sets forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken”).
 
The respondent provided two receipts as evidence of his retention of counsel for the proceedings (second motion to reopen at Tab I). The receipts state that they are for attorney’s fees, but do not identify the payee. Thus, they are not strong evidence that the respondent retained counsel as he claims. There is also a discrepancy between the receipts - one for $850 dated February 16, 2012, and one for $150 dated February 25, 2012 - and the respondent’s assertion in his bar complaint that he paid $1,000 on the day he signed the contract with counsel (see second motion to reopen at Tab V).
 
For these reasons, the respondent did not meet his burden of showing he had an agreement with counsel to represent him at the February 27, 2012, removal hearing.
 
Additionally, the respondent did not give his first attorney an opportunity to respond to his claim of ineffective assistance as required by Matter of Lozada. Because it is not apparent from the record that the first attorney was actually retained by the respondent, providing counsel an opportunity to respond to the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance is an important part of his burden of showing that reopening is warranted. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639 (“the potential for abuse is apparent where no mechanism exists for allowing former counsel, whose integrity or competence is being impugned, to present his version of events if he so chooses, thereby discouraging baseless allegations”); accord Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598-99 (9th Cir. 2003) (describing importance of Lozada’s requirement that former counsel be notified of allegations and given opportunity to respond). The respondent’s assertion that he tried to confront the attorney at his office but was instead “received by the attorney’s assistant” did not provide the attorney a meaningful opportunity to respond to the respondent’s claims (respondent’s brief at unnumbered page 7).
 
*4 In these two ways, the respondent did not satisfy his burden under Matter of Lozada to show deficient performance by counsel.1 Having not shown ineffective assistance of counsel or a deficiency in the Notice of Hearing, the respondent has not shown error in the denial of his first motion to reopen.
 
For these reasons, we will dismiss the appeal.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Given the lack of showing of deficiency in the performance of the respondent’s first counsel, no prejudice results from any deficient performance by the respondent’s second counsel, whose firm concedes they did not provide the respondent notice of the denial of his first motion to reopen.

IN RE: OSCAR ANTONIO GONZALEZ
File: AXXX XX1 147 - Newark, NJ
August 18, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rafael Figueroa, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Review of denial of Temporary Protected Status
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated February 27, 2013, finding him ineligible for temporary protected status (“TPS”) and ordering him removed to El Salvador. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). In that the respondent filed his application after May 11, 2005, these proceedings are subject to the REAL ID Act. Matter of S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 42 (BIA 2006).
 
An applicant for TPS may seek de novo review by an Immigration Judge in removal proceedings. See Matter of Ismael Lopez-Aldana, 25 I&N Dec. 49 (BIA 2009); see also Matter of Barrientos, 24 I&N Dec. 100 (BIA 2007). The initial period for registration for TPS for Salvadoran nationals was from March 9, 2001 to September 9, 2002. See 66 Fed. Reg. 14214 (Mar. 9, 2001). The respondent submitted an application for TPS on May 10, 2001, during the initial registration period. However, the respondent’s application was rejected by the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service on September 6, 2001, for insufficient funds and a rejection notice was sent to the respondent at his home address of record (Exh. 2 at illegible page number).
 
The respondent next filed an application for TPS on September 14, 2006. On December 13, 2006, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) informed the respondent that his application would be denied because he did not establish that he was eligible for the late registration provisions of the TPS regulations.1 The application was denied on May 29, 2007.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is ineligible for TPS (I.J. at 3-4). Although he filed an application during the initial registration period for El Salvador, the application was denied. The respondent alleges that he did not receive a notice that the check provided for the filing fee bounced, which also provided a limited opportunity to present the correct fee. Although the record does not contain a copy of the original notice, or the return of that notice, a second notice advising the respondent that his application was rejected for failure to pay the fee is contained in the record (Exh. 2 at illegible page number). The notice was sent to the respondent’s address of record. Id. The respondent also claims that he filed a subsequent application during the initial registration period, but there is no evidence of this filing in the administrative record. Therefore, the respondent did not establish that he had a TPS application pending when the initial registration period ended on September 9, 2002.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent reasserts his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, based on a notary’s handling of his TPS application (Respondent’s Brief at 7-8). However, even if we consider the respondent’s claim that there was the equivalent of ineffective assistance of counsel in the notary’s actions, the claim fails because the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements.2 See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (requiring alien to set forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel; that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and that the alien indicate whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not).
 
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has rejected a strict compliance rule regarding the third prong of Lozada, i.e., filing a bar complaint. See Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127 (3d Cir. 2001); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 559 (BIA 2003) (the Board will apply the applicable circuit court law in each respected circuit regarding Lozada strict compliance). Since the respondent asserts that it was not an attorney, but a notary who gave him erroneous advice, he cannot comply with the third prong of Lozada, i.e., filing a bar complaint. However, he can comply with the equivalent of the first and second prongs, and has not done so. The respondent has not set forth in any detail the agreement that was entered into with the notary, and although he testified that he does not remember the notary’s name, it is listed on his original application for TPS, of which there is a photocopy in the record (Exh. A at 22-25; Tr. at 47-48; Respondent’s Brief at 1-2). Thus, he has not substantially complied with the Lozada requirements (I.J. at 5). See e.g., Omar v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 647 (2d Cir. 2008); Bardales-Montes v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., No. 09-4703, 2011 WL 1370564 (3d Cir. Apr. 6, 2011) (unpublished).
 
Moreover, we agree with the Immigration Judge that even if the respondent were able to establish that he substantially complied with the Lozada requirements, he has not shown that the principle of equitable tolling is warranted in this matter, as he has failed to establish that he exercised due diligence “over the entire period for which tolling is desired” (I.J. at 4-5). Alzaarir v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 639 F.3d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008)).
 
*3 Inasmuch as the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent is ineligible for TPS and ordered him removed to El Salvador, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kim Alabasi, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Daniel Gilbert
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s March 6, 2014, decision denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings which were conducted in absentia on May 29, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal and, in the alternative, asks that we deem the respondent’s appeal to be withdrawn.1 Assuming for the purpose of appeal, that the respondent’s appeal was not withdrawn, we will nonetheless dismiss the appeal.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision with the following notations. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994).
 
A Notice to Appear (NTA) was personally served on the respondent on January 20, 2012 (Exh. 1). The respondent’s former counsel submitted a Notice of Entry of Appearance (Form EOIR-28) for the respondent on January 27, 2012 (I.J. at 1). A notice of hearing for May 29, 2012, was mailed to the respondent’s attorney at the address provided on the Form EOIR-28. On May 29, 2012, an attorney from the same law firm as the respondent’s attorney appeared, but the respondent did not (I.J. at 1-2). The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia. On February 12, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to rescind his in absentia removal order on the basis that he lacked notice and received ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge denied the motion and the respondent appealed.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent was afforded proper notice of his hearing on May 29, 2012, through his counsel of record (I.J. at 2). See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (recognizing that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5 (notice of hearing sent to an alien’s attorney of record is sufficient notice).
 
*2 We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “““exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order. See Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). However, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent cannot seek rescission of the in absentia order based on “exceptional circumstances,” because his motion to reopen was filed more than 180 days after the in absentia order of removal was entered (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
Alternatively, we also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established that his failure to appear at removal proceedings was due to ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 4). The respondent claims that either his attorney or a paralegal informed him that his hearing was not scheduled and he did not need to attend his hearing (Resp. Motion at 2; Resp. Br. at 4; Resp. Br. at Affidavit). While ineffective assistance of counsel may constitute an exceptional circumstance justifying the rescission of an in absentia removal order, the respondent must demonstrate that he complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent did not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra (I.J. at 2; Resp. Motion). The Immigration Judge properly denied the motion to reopen based on the lack of evidence.
 
On appeal, the respondent cites to a Ninth Circuit case, Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934 (9th Cir. 2003), for the proposition that strict adherence to Matter of Lozada, supra, is not required (Resp. Br. at 4). However, the Ninth Circuit has also held that the types of cases in which strict adherence to Matter of Lozada, supra, is not required are in those instances “when the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002); see also Tamang v. Holder, 598 F.3d 1083, 1090 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding that strict compliance with Lozada was necessary because the ineffectiveness of the former counsel was not “plain on its face”). The record here does not show a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance. This case would benefit from strict compliance with Matter of Lozada, and we find no basis to disturb the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948, 953 (5th Cir. 2012) (rejecting arguments for a flexible application of Lozada).
 
*3 Lastly, the Immigration Judge concluded, and we agree, that sua sponte reopening is not warranted in the respondent’s case. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent’s motion for a stay of removal was denied by this Board on March 20, 2014, and the respondent was physically removed on March 26, 2014. The DHS argues that that the respondent’s departure constitutes withdrawal of appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.4; Long v. Gonzales, 420 F.3d 516, 520 (5th Cir. 2005). As we decide this case on other grounds, we will not address this argument further.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
P. Michael Truman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)] - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)] - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document

Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)] - Conditional resident status terminated
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 16, 2013, decision denying his motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. During the pendency of his appeal, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge which will be considered by the Board as a motion to remand. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) (2014). The appeal will be sustained, the proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
The record reflects that through prior counsel the respondent conceded removability under section 237(a)(1)(D)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i), but denied removability under both charges lodged under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act. However, during his proceedings on October 26, 2012, the respondent, through the same counsel, conceded all factual allegations and charges in the Notice to Appear in exchange for pre-conclusion voluntary departure based on a deal with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) (I.J. at 3). The respondent was granted 120 days voluntary departure and, as required, waived appeal (I.J. at 3). Subsequently, on February 19, 2013, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge alleging ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 4). The DHS opposed the motion.
 
On April 16, 2013, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion (I.J. at 5-6). Specifically, the Immigration Judge found that, while the respondent had complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), he had not shown sufficient due diligence in seeking redress for purposes of equitably tolling the motion’s deadline which had long since passed (I.J. at 5-6). See Riley v. INS, 310 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir. 2002). In this regard, the Immigration Judge noted that, while the evidence showed the respondent knew of his former counsels’ actions upon which he based his claim of ineffectiveness as early as the day after the October 26, 2012, hearing, he had not sought new counsel until almost 4 months later (I.J. at 5). Further, the Immigration Judge found that, even if the respondent had used due diligence, he had not established prejudice because he did not dispute the concessions and admissions he made through prior counsel (I.J. at 6). See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent appealed that decision.
 
*2 Given that there is no dispute the respondent complied with the technical requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, we find that the Immigration Judge erred in finding the respondent did not exercise due diligence in seeking redress for his claims of ineffectiveness and in finding the respondent did not establish prejudice (I.J. at 5-6). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (de novo review). The record reflects that the respondent contacted the Immigration Judge the day after his proceedings on October 26, 2012, notifying her of his grievances against his former counsel. In his letter, the respondent indicated to the Immigration Judge that there was some coercion in his acceptance of the deal with DHS to concede all charges, waive his rights to file for relief and to appeal, and to accept pre-conclusion voluntary departure. Although the respondent expressed his unwillingness to make the deal and possible “threats” of arrest communicated to him by his prior counsel, the Immigration Judge did not take any action at that time.
 
Further, contrary to the Immigration Judge’s decision, the evidence submitted by the respondent with his motion reflects that he sought new counsel as early as November 1, 2012, when he signed a contract with another law firm (I.J. at 5). According to this evidence, the new firm was notified of the respondent’s claims but did not take any action and the contract was terminated by the respondent in January 2013 when he sought current counsel. The respondent’s motion was filed less than a month later. Based on his efforts to obtain new counsel within a few days of his hearing, we cannot agree that the respondent did not exercise due diligence (I.J. at 5-6). In addition, the fact that the respondent was not permitted to apply for any relief from removal, such as obtaining a de novo review of his Form I-751, by virtue of his acceptance of pre-conclusion voluntary departure establishes the requisite prejudice for his ineffective assistance of counsel claim (I.J. at 6). See Matter of Assaad, supra. Based on the circumstances of this case, in particular the Immigration Judge’s decision not to act upon the respondent’s October 27, 2012, letter; the respondent’s actions in seeking new counsel within a few days of his October 26, 2012, hearing; and, the inability of the respondent to file for any type of relief from removal, we find that reopening is warranted.1
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, the proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.

CHARGE:

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s order dated December 31, 2013, denying her motion to reopen her proceedings. The request for a waiver of the appeal fee is granted. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the determination of credibility. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues de novo, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was ordered removed in absentia when she failed to appear for her removal hearing. She filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court arguing that she did not receive notice of her hearing. The record reflects that the hearing notice was mailed to the respondent at the address she provided and was returned as undeliverable after her hearing. The respondent contends that she provided notice of her change of address, but does not state with whom she filed such a change and the record does not include a change of address. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. On appeal, the respondent states only her “attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel and this ineffective assistance resulted in Motion to Reopen being denied.” (Notice of Appeal, Form EOIR-26).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The respondent does not contest the Immigration Judge’s finding that she failed to update the Immigration Court with a new address (I.J. Dec. at 3). See section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(B) (eliminating the notice requirement where the alien fails to provide contact information); see also Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674-76 (BIA 2008) (stating that an alien must comply with the statutory responsibility to provide current address information). The respondent’s assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel is not supported by any facts nor has the respondent complied with any of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1998). We therefore find no reason to disturb the decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen the in absentia hearing. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Timothy Lee Cook, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jordan, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 21, 2013. The Immigration Judge denied as abandoned the respondent’s application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent failed to timely file his application for relief. The appeal will be dismissed in part and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record reflects that at a hearing on April 21, 2011, the respondent, through prior counsel, Ms. Melinda Alizadeh-Fard, admitted the factual allegations contained in the Notice to Appear (Form I-862), including the allegation that the respondent was admitted as a nonimmigrant spouse of a United States citizen with authorization to remain in the United States for a temporary period not to exceed August 31, 2008, and that he remained in the United States beyond that date without authorization (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 5; Exh. 1). The respondent, through Ms. Alizadeh-Fard, conceded removability as charged under section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B), as an alien who, after admission, remained in the United States for a time longer than permitted. Also at the April 21, 2011, hearing, the respondent, through Ms. Alizadeh Fard, indicated that he wished to pursue adjustment of status based on his marriage to a United States citizen, to whom he had been married for three years at the time of the hearing (Tr. at 7).
 
At the next hearing on September 27, 2011, the respondent appeared with Ms. Alizadeh-Fard, and informed the Immigration Judge that the I-130 petition filed on his behalf by his current spouse had been approved. The Immigration Judge continued the case until March 22, 2013, and ordered the respondent to file his application for adjustment of status by June 1, 2012 (Tr. at 19-20). The Immigration Judge informed the respondent, through Ms. Alizadeh-Fard, that if his application was not filed by the deadline set, he would deem the application abandoned and order the respondent removed (Tr. at 20). Ms. Alizadeh-Fard indicated that she understood and agreed to those consequences (Tr. at 20). The respondent did not thereafter file his application by the date set by the Immigration Judge, and accordingly, the Immigration Judge issued a decision deeming his application for relief abandoned and ordering the respondent removed.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent asserts that Ms. Alizadeh-Fard provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to file his adjustment of status application in a timely manner. The respondent also asserts on appeal that he is eligible for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). In support of the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim, the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In addition, the record contains an undated letter from Ms. Alizadeh-Fard to the Immigration Court in Dallas, indicating that, although she was at the September 27, 2011, hearing, she was not aware of the June 1, 2012, deadline for filing the respondent’s adjustment of status application. The record does not support this statement inasmuch as Ms. Alizadeh-Ford, as previously noted, acknowledged the June 1, 2012, deadline at the September 27, 2011, hearing, and indicated that she understood the consequences of not meeting that deadline (Tr. at 20). We also note that the record does not contain a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28) from Ms. Alizadeh-Ford before the Immigration Judge so as to establish that she was qualified to speak on behalf of the respondent.
 
With respect to the respondent’s application for adjustment of status, we conclude that, notwithstanding any potential ineffective assistance provided by Ms. Alizadeh-Fard, the respondent cannot establish that he suffered prejudice on account of such ineffective assistance. See Alzainati v. Holder, 568 F.3d 844, 851 (10th Cir. 2009) (requiring a showing of prejudice to support a due process violation claim). Specifically, the respondent cannot establish statutory eligibility for adjustment of status under section 245(a) based on his current marriage inasmuch as he entered as a K-3 nonimmigrant based on his marriage to another United States citizen. We have held that section 245(d) of the Act bars K visa holders from adjusting to permanent resident status on any basis other than the marriage to the citizen who petitioned on their behalf. See Matter of Valenzuela, 25 I&N Dec. 867, 869 (BIA 2012). The record does not contain evidence that the respondent was admitted to the United States in a manner other than as a K-3 nonimmigrant, and therefore he does not appear to be eligible to adjust his status through his current marriage.
 
However, based on the totality of the evidence before us, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge to provide the respondent with an opportunity to apply for voluntary departure, or any other relief for which he may be eligible. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of April 16, 2013.1 In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered deported in absentia on January 9, 1996. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent alleges he did not appear because immigration officials recorded his address incorrectly as “New York” rather than “Jamaica.” However, as noted by the Immigration Judge, the notice of hearing (NOH) for the January 9, 1996, hearing, was properly served on the respondent’s counsel (Exh. 2). On December 22, 1995, counsel filed a motion to withdraw, informing the Immigration Judge that the respondent had been notified of his hearing, and noting that the respondent had failed to maintain reasonable communication with counsel (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge granted the motion to withdraw on January 9, 1996, and counsel was served with the in absentia order.
 
In denying the motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge correctly found that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent (I.J. at 2). See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a). On appeal, the respondent has not addressed the Immigration Judge’s finding that notice on counsel was proper.
 
On appeal, the respondent again alleges he did not receive notice or the in absentia order. We note that the January 9, 1996, in absentia order was properly served on his former counsel. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. Here, however, the respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance by former counsel; nor has the respondent fulfilled any of the Lozada criteria. Consequently, the respondent has failed to perfect a claim of ineffective assistance of his counsel, and there is no basis to reopen under “exceptional circumstances.”
 
*2 The respondent’s motion, to the extent that it seeks new relief in the form of adjustment of status, was filed more than 90 days after he was ordered deported from the United States in absentia. His request for reopening to that extent is therefore untimely. See Matter of Monges, 25 I&N Dec. 246 (BIA 2010); Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew Kriezelman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Seth B. Fitter
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on May 14, 2013, when we reconsidered, pursuant to our sua sponte authority, our denial of the respondent’s first motion to reopen and again denied reopening. On April 16, 2014, the respondent, a native and citizen of Pakistan, filed a second motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In the motion, he asked that his case be remanded so that he may pursue adjustment of status on the basis of an approved visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife. On May 6, 2014, the respondent filed a request for a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes both the respondent’s motion to reopen and his request for a stay of removal. The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.
 
Section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), states that an alien may file one motion to reopen. The respondent’s current motion, however, is his second motion to reopen. The respondent’s motion therefore is numerically barred.
 
Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, in turn, states that motions to reopen “““shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.”1 We entered the final administrative order of removal in the respondent’s case on November 21, 2012. The respondent did not file his current motion until more than a year later. The respondent’s motion to reopen therefore is untimely.
 
The respondent claims that his motion is exempt from the time and numeric limits because it is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the circuit in which the respondent’s case arises, has held that the 90-day deadline for filing a motion to reopen is a statute of limitations and therefore is subject to equitable tolling. See Gaberov v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 590, 594 (7th Cir. 2008). To establish that a situation, like being a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, warrants equitable tolling, an alien must establish that he or she acted with due diligence during the period he or she is seeking to have tolled. Id. Specifically, in this case, the respondent must establish that he could not reasonably have been expected to file his motion earlier. See El-Gazawy v. Holder, 690 F.3d 852, 850 (7th Cir. 2012). The respondent has not met this burden.
 
*2 The respondent claims that he did not discover the ineffective assistance of his prior attorney until he contacted his current attorney about the petition for review that his prior attorney had filed with the Seventh Circuit. The respondent, however, has not explained why our May 14, 2013, decision in his case did not put him on notice of his prior attorney’s alleged failure to inform him that he needed to submit an application for adjustment of status with his motion to reopen to pursue adjustment.2 The respondent also has not provided specific details, such as the date he contacted his current attorney or the date he tried to determine the status of his petition for review. In light of these facts, we cannot conclude that the respondent has met his burden of establishing that he could not reasonably have been expected to file his motion to reopen sooner.
 
In addition, the respondent has not satisfied the procedural requirements necessary to obtain reopening on the basis of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and he has not provided sufficient information to establish that he was, in fact, the victim of ineffective assistance. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Marinov v. Holder, 687 F.3d 365, 368-69 (7th Cir. 2012) (confirming validity of Lozada requirements). To obtain reopening on the basis of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must submit an affidavit detailing the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what former counsel did or did not represent to the respondent in this regard. Id at 639. The respondent, however, has provided little, if any, information regarding his agreement with his former attorney. Further, the respondent appears to have stated incorrectly that his petition for review was dismissed due to the inaction of his former counsel. The Seventh Circuit records do indicate that the court ordered the respondent to show cause why the case should not be dismissed for lack of prosecution, but the records also indicate that the respondent’s case was dismissed pursuant to a motion submitted by his current counsel rather than due to the inaction of his former counsel.3 See Abbas v. Holder, No. 13-2283 (7th Cir. June 3, 2014). Without more information, we cannot conclude that the respondent has satisfied the first requirement of Matter of Lozada, supra, or that he has established that the alleged errors of his former attorney, in fact, constitute ineffective assistance.
 
The respondent also has not satisfied the second Lozada requirement. In particular, he has not established that he has notified his former counsel of the charges against him. The respondent has submitted a letter directed to his former attorney, but he has not submitted sufficient evidence to establish that this letter was mailed or that his former counsel had adequate notice of the charges and an opportunity to respond.
 
*3 Finally, the respondent has not met his burden of establishing that he was prejudiced by his former attorney’s conduct. See El-Gazawy v. Holder, supra, at 860 (stating that establishing prejudice means showing that errors actually had the potential for affecting the outcome of the proceeding). As we noted above, the respondent’s petition for review was not dismissed due to the neglect or inaction of his former attorney. In addition, the respondent has not established that he was the beneficiary of an approved visa petition when we reconsidered and again denied his motion to reopen to pursue adjustment, and the respondent has not established that he warranted a grant of reopening at that time in light of the other factors in his case. See section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a) (listing statutory requirements for adjustment of status); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-73 (BIA 1992) (indicating that an alien seeking reopening for further consideration of an application for relief bears a “heavy burden” and must present evidence of such a nature that the Board is satisfied that, if proceedings are reopened, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case).
 
Based on the foregoing, the respondent has not met his burden of establishing that the filing deadline or numeric limitations on motions to reopen should be equitably tolled in his case. Further, he has not established that reopening is warranted pursuant to our sua sponte authority. See, e.g., Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We therefore deny the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely and numerically barred.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

In referring to the motions deadline, the respondent incorrectly cites the deadline for filing a motion to rescind an in absentia order. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The respondent was not ordered removed in absentia. Accordingly, this deadline is not applicable to him. The deadline contained in section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act applies to his motion.

The respondent alleges that his prior attorney committed several errors including failing to inform him that an adjustment application needed to be included with his motion to reopen, failing to include the application in the motion, not responding to the respondent’s calls or inquiries while the petition for review was pending, and not filing the necessary briefs and responses with the Seventh Circuit. As we note later in our decision, however, the respondent has not provided an affidavit describing the agreement he had with his former counsel regarding representation. The letter notifying the respondent’s former attorney of the charges against him also is only dated 3 days before the respondent filed his current motion, and the respondent has not submitted proof of mailing. It therefore is not clear that the respondent’s former attorney has received sufficient notice of the charges against him. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).

3

We note that the respondent has not provided any information regarding the agreement he reached with his former counsel regarding the petition for review. Without more information on this issue, we do not have a sufficient basis for concluding that the lack of action on the petition for review was due to attorney error rather than to inaction or error on the part of the respondent.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: JACOB DENEDO
File: AXXX XX6 817 - Bloomington, MN
July 15, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vincent P. Martin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Colin P. Johnson
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent has filed an untimely appeal concerning an Immigration Judge’s order denying a motion to reopen, accompanied by a request to have the Board accept the appeal late. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) filed a “Motion for Summary Dismissal of Untimely Appeal.” The request to have the Board consider the appeal out of time will be denied, and the appeal will be dismissed as untimely.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Nigeria. He was charged with being subject to removal under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), for having been convicted in military court of a crime involving moral turpitude.
 
In an order mailed on July 13, 2011, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the removal proceedings, which were conducted in absentia. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of the Immigration Judge’s decision. See •8 C.F.R. § 1003.38. The appeal was filed almost three years late, on April 21, 2014.
 
At the time the motion to reopen was filed with the Immigration Judge, the respondent was represented by attorney Bobby Gordon Onyemeh Sea. In 2012, Sea was convicted of filing false federal income tax returns. He was disciplined by the Supreme Court of Minnesota, and has been disbarred from practice by this Board.
 
The respondent claims that Sea “did not contact him again” about his removal case, after he retained Sea’s services in April, 2011. As a result, the respondent claims, the untimely appeal should be accepted despite it being filed years out of time.
 
A party claiming that equitable tolling applies to a deadline in immigration proceedings must show that he acted with reasonable diligence. See Valencia v. Holder, 657 F.3d 745, 748-49 (8th Cir. 2011). The respondent provides no explanation as to why he took no action to contact Sea, and inquire about the status of his case, between 2011, and 2014, when he was detained by immigration authorities.
 
The respondent, moreover, does not meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent did not give former counsel the opportunity to respond to the allegations, and did not indicate that a disciplinary complaint was filed. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639; see also Ortiz-Puentes v. Holder, 662 F.3d 481, 484 (8th Cir. 2011); Valencia v. Holder, supra, at 748.
 
*2 The appeal will, therefore, be dismissed as untimely.
 
ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s order mailed on July 13, 2011, is final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.

File: AXXX XX9 718 - Newark, NJ

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Elizabeth M. Trinidad, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s January 16, 2013, decision denying her motion to reopen removal proceedings.1 The respondent’s request for a waiver of the appellate filing fee is granted; her request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(e)(7), 1003.8(a)(3). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, under the “““clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was placed in removal proceedings following the issuance of a Notice to Appear (Form I-862) on July 15, 2010 (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). On September 28, 2010, the respondent attended a hearing conducted by the Immigration Judge and received warnings about the consequences of failing to appear at her following hearing (I.J. at 4; Exh. 3B). On March 29, 2011, the respondent did not appear for her scheduled hearing before the Immigration Court (I.J. at 1). The Immigration Judge conducted the March 29, 2011, hearing in absentia and entered an order of removal in a decision signed on March 31, 2011 (I.J. at 1).2
 
On October 22, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reopen her removal proceedings, asserting that her failure to appear at the scheduled hearing was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 1-3; Motion to Reopen at 2-3). The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for purposes of her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 4). However, the Immigration Judge denied the motion upon concluding that the respondent had neither demonstrated that her failure to appear was due to “exceptional circumstances” nor that ineffective assistance of counsel prevented her from timely moving to reopen proceedings (I.J. at 3-4).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in considering the documents submitted by her prior counsel and according them greater weight than the evidence she submitted to support her claim of ineffective assistance (Respondent’s Brief at 7-11). The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge did not properly evaluate whether the conduct of her prior counsel, Ms. Cheung, and an associated paralegal, Mr. Hernandez, amounted to ineffective assistance, such that the filing period for her motion to reopen should be equitably tolled (Respondent’s Brief at 11-17).
 
Upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate that her failure to appear at her March 29, 2011, hearing was due to an exceptional circumstance beyond her control (I.J. at 3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); see also section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). The Board has held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order, where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). There is no dispute that the respondent fulfilled the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra (I.J. at 4). However, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent did not establish that she was defrauded or that Ms. Cheung and Mr. Hernandez misadvised her about the consequences of failing to appear at her scheduled hearing (I.J. at 4).
 
We discern no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not demonstrate that she was the victim of fraud or that her failure to appear at the scheduled hearing was attributable to the deficient advice of former counsel (I.J. at 4). See Borges v. Gonzales, 402 F.3d 398, 407 (3d Cir. 2005) (observing that “[a] finding of fraud is a factual determination”). We acknowledge the respondent’s appellate assertion that the Immigration Judge should not have considered Ms. Cheung’s documentary submission (Respondent’s Brief at 7-10). Yet, we are not persuaded that an assessment of that documentary submission was fundamentally unfair or that the statements of an aggrieved party subject to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may not be considered in the context of a motion to reopen (Respondent’s Brief at 7-10). See, e.g., Matter of Rivera, supra (considering the statements in an affidavit provided by the alien’s former counsel in assessing an ineffective assistance claim); cf. Borges v. Gonzales, supra, at 404 (indicating that the Board evaluated both the alien’s and his former counsel’s affidavits in ruling on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
*3 Moreover, although the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge credited Ms. Cheung’s and Mr. Hernandez’s statements over her own, the record reflects that the Immigration Judge decided that reopening was not warranted based on the respondent’s version of events, as set forth in the respondent’s initial affidavit (I.J. at 4; Motion to Reopen, Tab E; Respondent’s Brief 10-11).3 In particular, the Immigration Judge observed that the respondent admitted that she knew she would be removed if she did not appear for her scheduled hearing (I.J. at 4; Motion to Reopen, Tab E, at 42). We find no clear error in this observation, given that the respondent had previously appeared for a hearing before the Immigration Judge (on September 28, 2010), at which time she received warnings about the consequences of a failure to appear (I.J. at 4; Exh. 3B; Motion to Reopen, Tab E, at 29).
 
Additionally, the Immigration Judge determined that, through her discussions with Ms. Cheung and Mr. Hernandez, the respondent was presented with accurate information regarding her eligibility for relief and the consequences of failing to appear at the March 29, 2011, hearing (I.J. at 4). Specifically, the Immigration Judge observed that the respondent was told that she could apply for voluntary departure, but she was unwilling to depart the United States (I.J. at 3). The respondent’s affidavit confirms that she was advised that she could request voluntary departure at her March 29, 2011, hearing (Motion to Reopen, Tab E, at 37).
 
The respondent objects to the Immigration Judge’s statement that “[t]here is no evidence that [she] was advised to stay away from the court in March, 2011” (I.J. at 3; Respondent’s Brief at 11). We concur with the respondent that her affidavit constitutes evidence in this regard; however, she stated therein that Mr. Hernandez told her that she could opt not to return to court and hide from authorities or appear in court and pursue voluntary departure (I.J. at 3-4; Motion to Reopen, Tab E, at 37, 42; Respondent’s Brief at 11). In view of the contents of the respondent’s affidavit, we find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent “made a strategic and knowing choice to evade her immigration hearing and the immigration authorities” (I.J. at 4).
 
Based on the Immigration Judge’s assessments, we will uphold the ruling that the respondent did not establish exceptional circumstances that would warrant reopening based on her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The statements in the respondent’s affidavit, if accepted as true, reflect that she received unscrupulous advice in several respects. However, considering the facts in a light most favorable to the respondent, we cannot conclude that the Immigration Judge erred in deciding that the respondent did not demonstrate that her failure to attend her scheduled hearing was the result of former counsel’s deficient performance (I.J. at 3-4).
 
*4 In light of the foregoing, we will affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the repsondent’s motion to reopen. Because we hold that the respondent did not establish that her failure to appear at the hearing held in absentia was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel, we need not reach the issue whether she demonstrated sufficient grounds for equitable tolling of the motion filing deadline (I.J. at 4-5; Respondent’s Brief at 11-17). See Matter of S-H-, supra, at 464.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: JOSEPH NJUGUNA MUNIU
File: AXXX XX6 658 - Chicago, IL

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Swaray E. Conteh, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michelle M. Venci
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Kenya, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of July 17, 2013. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on April 25, 2013. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts.
 
Here, as noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent, through counsel, filed a change of venue motion, containing his new address in South Bend, IN, to which the February 7, 2013, Notice of Hearing (NOH) was mailed. In his motion to reopen, the respondent admitted that after the change of venue, he moved to Indianapolis. He does not explain the South Bend address in his motion to reopen. Nor does he allege that he filed a change of address to any of his Indianapolis addresses.
 
An alien bears an affirmative responsibility to keep the agency informed of his correct, current address. See generally Dominguez v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 284 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir. 2002). In fact, under section 240(a)(1)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(F), an alien must immediately provide the government with an address at which he may be contacted and must immediately provide notice of any change of the alien’s address. See section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(F); see also Dominguez, 284 F.3d at 1260. Given this duty, “notice to the alien at the most recent address provided by the alien is sufficient notice,” justifying an in absentia removal. Dominguez, 284 F.3d at 1260.
 
The respondent is not entitled to rescission of a removal order where the failure to receive actual notice of the time of the hearing is the result of his failure to comply with the obligation to keep the Immigration Court apprised of his current mailing address. The alien who evades notice cannot reopen the removal hearing. See Peralta-Cabrera v. Gonzales, 501 F.3d 837, 843-44 (7th Cir. 2007); Sabir v. Gonzales, 421 F.3d 456, 458-59 (7th Cir. 2005).
 
*2 We agree with the Immigration Judge that service of the NOH was properly mailed to the last address provided by the respondent, whether it was valid or not. Furthermore, as is the case here, if an alien does not fulfill his obligation to report his address change, notice of the hearing is not required pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(b)(5)(B), and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Finally, service by mail is sufficient if the record contains proof of attempted delivery to the last address provided by the alien in accordance with section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(F). Section 239(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(c). As the record contains proof of attempted delivery to the address provided by the respondent as reflected in the change of venue motion, the respondent can be charged with receiving proper notice, regardless that the respondent may not have actually received the NOH. Consequently, the NOH was properly mailed to the respondent at the South Bend address, and the respondent has not established that non-delivery was not due to his own fault. See Joshi v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 732, 736 (7th Cir. 2004) (the fact that the intended recipient did not actually receive notice does not contradict evidence that delivery was attempted and the notice requirement thus satisfied.).
 
On appeal, the respondent now admits that he at some point lived at the South Bend address; that the change of venue motion provided the South Bend address; and he further alleges a lack of communication between him and his former counsel. To the extent he is alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, we find no merit. The Board has established threshold requirements for bringing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The alien must submit an affidavit establishing that he had an agreement with counsel to represent him, as well as the terms of representation; the alien must present evidence that he informed counsel of the allegations against him and gave an opportunity to respond; and there must be a statement indicating whether a complaint has been filed against appropriate disciplinary authorities and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). See also Marinov v. Holder, 687 F.3d 365, 368 (7th Cir. 2012). Here, the respondent has fulfilled none of the Lozada requirements.
 
We find that the respondent has not established an exceptional circumstance herein to warrant the sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
*3 For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX2 785 - Chicago, IL

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Al Kola, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Minnie D. Yuen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of May 24, 2013. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on March 28, 2013. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent alleges he did not appear “because of the exceptional circumstance of not being aware of the change of court dates.” As noted by the Immigration Judge, the notice of hearing for the March 28, 2013, hearing, was served on the respondent’s counsel and counsel appeared at the March 28, 2013, hearing, at which time counsel informed the Immigration Judge that the respondent had been notified of his hearing (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge correctly found that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent (I.J. at 2). See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a).
 
On appeal, the respondent again alleges he did not receive notice of his hearing and takes issue with the Immigration Judge’s acceptance of his former counsel’s assertion (apparently that counsel advised the respondent of his hearing) (Respondent’s Appeal Brief, page 4). We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. Here, however, the respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance by former counsel; nor has the respondent fulfilled any of the Lozada criteria. Consequently, the respondent has failed to perfect a claim of ineffective assistance of his counsel, and there is no basis to reopen under “exceptional circumstances.”
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: AMONCIO CRUZ-GOMEZ
File: AXXX XX2 131 - Memphis, TN
June 26, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ellis D. Bingham, III
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 22, 2013, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the scheduled hearing on March 12, 2013. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred by analyzing this case as a Lozada claim, as the facts indicate that neither the attorney nor the respondent received notice of the hearing. The respondent states that he does not allege misconduct by his former counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). He also asserts that as there is no transcript of the proceeding, it is impossible to discern whether oral notice of the hearing was provided. However, a transcript is not ordinarily prepared where a motion to reopen is filed, since the motion will be decided on the basis of its merits rather than on the basis of a review of the record. See Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996) (noting transcript ordinarily not present when motion to reopen filed).
 
The respondent does not dispute that he and his former counsel, Robert B. Ogletree, Esquire, were present in court on March 20, 2012 and received notice of the individual hearing scheduled for August 8, 2013. See Exh. 2. However, he claims that he did not receive notice for the March 12, 2013, hearing. The Immigration Judge indicates in his decision dated August 22, 2013, that the respondent’s claim that he did not know about the March 12, 2013, hearing is incorrect, as the respondent was told in the Spanish language, through an interpreter, that he would be returning to the court two more times and the Immigration Judge stated the dates of the two hearings (I.J. at 3). The Immigration Judge also indicates that Mr. Ogletree was provided oral and written notice of the respondent’s two hearing dates, one to file his application on March 12, 2013, and one for his individual hearing on August 8, 2013. The certificate of service for each notice of hearing indicates that the respondent’s attorney and counsel for the Department of Homeland Security received personal service of the notices. See Exh. 2. Therefore, the record supports the finding that the respondent was provided oral notice and his former counsel was provided oral and written notice of the master hearing scheduled for March 12, 2013. Notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). The respondent indicates that he is not alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, and therefore, we will not address that issue. We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
*2 We further find no basis for exercising our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings in this case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX1 901 - Houston, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jorge Guttlein, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated May 22, 2013, denying his motion to reconsider. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
On January 30, 2006, the respondent’s former counsel was personally served with a Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings (“NOH”) in order to place the respondent on notice that a removal hearing had been scheduled in these proceedings on February 22, 2006 (Exh. 5). As the respondent did not appear at the hearing, he was ordered removed from the United States in absentia. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A).
 
On March 19, 2013, the respondent moved for reopening on the basis of a claim that he did not receive the aforementioned NOH. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act. His motion to reopen did not raise any claim to ineffective assistance of counsel and was not accompanied by any the evidence required by this Board’s decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). On April 3, 2013, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen upon concluding that, as the respondent’s former counsel was personally served with the NOH, notice was effective.1 See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Men Keng Chang v. Jiugni, 669 F.2d 275, 277 (5th Cir. 1982); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien). The respondent filed his motion to reconsider, which is the subject of the current appeal, on May 2, 2013.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The respondent has not established any legal or factual error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2). In particular, the respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge’s finding that the NOH was personally served upon his former counsel is factually erroneous, nor that the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent is legally erroneous.
 
*2 The respondent’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were not properly presented to the Immigration Judge. A motion to reconsider is an alien’s opportunity to specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and not an opportunity to present new evidence, nor an opportunity to reiterate or expand upon arguments that have been previously raised and considered. See Matter of 0-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). While the Act, vis-à-vis the filing of a motion to reopen, grants an alien who is subject to an order of removal an opportunity to present new evidence, the respondent used his single opportunity to present a claim to reopening when he filed his initial motion to reopen on March 19, 2013. See section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). As such, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s claim to reconsideration on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Medrano, 20 I&N Dec. 216 (BIA 1990, 1991) (holding that a motion to reconsider which is based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied).
 
The respondent has attached numerous documents to his appeal brief. The Board does not consider evidence first provided on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv); Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984) (“The Board is an appellate body whose function is to review, not to create, a record.”). Additionally, to the extent that the submission of evidence on appeal can be construed as a request for a remand, such a request is number-barred. See Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000). As discussed above, the respondent used his single opportunity to request reopening when, on March 19, 2013, he filed his aforementioned motion to reopen on account of lack of notice which, for the reasons stated above, the Immigration Judge properly denied.
 
For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reconsider. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent filed his Notice of Appeal from a Decision of an Immigration Judge (Form EOIR-26) with this Board on June 14, 2013. As such, any challenge to the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his motion to reopen is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kristine E. Michel, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Amy E. Greene
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 1, 2013, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen. The respondent asserts that he established ineffective assistance of his former counsel because he did not fully understand the consequences of voluntary departure and he would have sought different relief from removal.
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge issued a decision on January 17, 2013, granting the respondent pre-conclusion voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). The respondent filed a motion to reopen on May 17, 2013, claiming ineffective assistance of his former counsel, Rafael Diaz, Esquire, because he did not inform the respondent of any potential relief from removal or discuss a potential request for prosecutorial discretion. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. (BIA 1988). The respondent claims that although he indicated to the Immigration Judge that he understood what voluntary departure meant, he maintains that he did not fully understand the consequences of voluntary departure because of the lack of advice from Mr. Diaz. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, finding that the respondent has not identified any relief that should have been sought before the court, and that the Department of Homeland Security has jurisdiction over requests for prosecutorial discretion.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen before the Immigration Court was filed untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).1 The respondent concedes that he indicated during the proceedings that he understood and accepted pre-conclusion voluntary departure. Moreover, the respondent has not established that he complied with the notice requirements of Lozada, as he informed his former counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel just three days before filing the motion to reopen with the Immigration Court. See Marinov v. Holder, 687 F.3d 365, 369 (7th Cir. 2012) (court held that Board did not abuse its discretion in upholding denial of motion to reopen where timing of bar complaint denied him any realistic opportunity to respond to the allegations).
 
*2 Furthermore, the respondent did not establish that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s actions. The respondent has not identified on appeal any type of relief from removal for which he is eligible to apply. He states that he would have sought different relief from removal, but he does not state what type of relief. The respondent also indicates that he could have sought prosecutorial discretion with the Department of Homeland Security. However, a request for prosecutorial discretion is within the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security, and the Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals do not have any authority to grant such relief. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX4 192 - San Antonio, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thomas Esparza, Jr., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Stuart D. Alcorn
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; adjustment of status
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 21, 2013, denying his motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status as the spouse of a United States citizen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The record reflects that on August 7, 2000, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure until December 5, 2000. The respondent did not depart during the voluntary departure period. He filed a motion to reopen on April 5, 2012, based on an approval notice dated December 5, 2001, regarding the visa petition filed on his behalf by his United States citizen spouse. The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status. He asserts that the ineffective assistance of his prior counsel, Mansel Turton, Esquire, prejudiced his ability to present and prosecute an application for adjustment of status.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion was filed untimely, as it was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s August 7, 2000, decision. Furthermore, we have determined that the Board and the courts do not have authority to recognize equitable exceptions to the section 240B(d) bar beyond those specifically provided in the voluntary departure provisions. Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87, 92 (BIA 2007); section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d). We acknowledge that the 10-year bar has elapsed since the voluntary departure order was issued. However, the respondent in the instant matter was aware of the requirements of the voluntary departure order, as the respondent was advised by the Immigration Judge of the limitation on discretionary relief for failure to depart by the stated deadline. However, he did not leave within the voluntary departure period.
 
The respondent claims on appeal he is eligible to have his proceedings reopened because he was improperly advised while being represented. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The Immigration Judge correctly determined that at the time of his hearing in August 2000, the respondent did not establish that any relief was available to him, other than voluntary departure. The respondent argues that the motion to reopen is not untimely because of equitable tolling. As noted by the Immigration Judge, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has not determined if equitable tolling of statutory deadlines for ineffective assistance of counsel applies in immigration cases.1 We agree with the Immigration Judge that even if the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed equitable tolling in these types of cases, the respondent has not exercised due diligence in seeking to reopen proceedings. The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed more than eight years after his last application to the government, Form I-212, was denied by the Department of Homeland Security in January 2005. See DHS Response to Motion to Reopen, Tab C.
 
*2 Furthermore, as a matter of discretion, we find that the facts presented in this case do not warrant an intervention of our sua sponte authority to reopen the proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Leo Jerome Lahey, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Renae M. Hansell
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Israel who was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on December 13, 2012, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, signed January 31, 2013, denying his motion to reopen.1 The respondent’s appeal, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security, will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent has not articulated a basis which warrants reopened proceedings. See sections 240(b)(5)(C), (c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229(b)(5)(C), (c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). The respondent, through counsel, acknowledged that he was scheduled for a hearing on December 13, 2012, when he moved for a continuance on December 4, 2012. Thus, he has not established that he did not have notice of his removal hearing. While, at the time of his removal hearing, the respondent had a pending motion to change venue (which was present in the Record of Proceedings at the time of the entry of the in absentia order of removal) (I.J. at 2), “exceptional circumstances” did not excuse his failure to appear as “[t]he filing of a motion to change venue does not excuse the appearance of an alien or representative at any scheduled hearing.” Immigration Court Practice Manual, § 5.10(c) at 102 (June 10, 2013); see also Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996). While counsel for the respondent concedes that he “failed to press upon the respondent the necessity of his presence in the Atlanta Court if the change of venue was not granted” (Respondent’s Br. at 4), the respondent has not brought forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (I.J. at 2). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
To the extent that the respondent is offering new evidence on appeal, i.e., evidence that he has filed for post-conviction relief, the pendency of post-conviction relief claims does not affect the finality of a conviction for immigration purposes. See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992). As such, a remand is not warranted for the Immigration Judge to consider said evidence. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992). To the extent that the respondent appears to be also requesting sua sponte reopening, such measures have not been shown to be warranted. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, we decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. The following order is entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX3 887 - Oklahoma City, OK
June 11, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael Robert Abdoveis, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On March 14, 2014, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen proceedings in which the Board dismissed his appeal on August 1, 2013. He also seeks a stay of removal. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely as it was filed more than 90 days after the Board’s decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). However, he contends that reopening is appropriate as he had ineffective assistance from former counsel. In support of his motion, he has submitted evidence reflecting that he filed a bar complaint against former counsel, and informed him of this fact (Motion, attachment at 1-7). Mickeviciute v. INS, 327 F.3d 1159, 1161 n. 2 (10th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The letter to former counsel states that, because counsel did not file a criminal history chart, the respondent was unable to meet his burden of proving eligibility for voluntary departure and adjustment of status (Motion, attachment at 6-7).
 
However, to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must not only satisfy the procedural requirements for such a claim. Rather, he must also show that he was prejudiced by counsel’s reported ineffective performance. Ochieng v. Mukasey, 520 F.3d 1110, 1115 (10th Cir. 2008) (rejecting ineffective-assistance claim based on failure to show prejudice). Prejudice is shown by demonstrating that, but for counsel’s ineffective performance, the result of his case would have been different. Duran-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1158, 1163 (10th Cir. 2003). We find that the respondent has not met this burden.
 
The failure to submit records regarding the respondent’s criminal history was only one of many factors that the Immigration Judge considered in rendering his adverse credibility and discretionary determinations. The respondent’s testimony that he was arrested for a firearm offense (Tr. at 42-6) was not a factor in his inconsistent testimony regarding his dates of his marriage and travel into the United States, his knowledge of his wife’s filing of fraudulent tax returns, his own failure to file tax returns for 24 years, his initial false report in his adjustment application of having no arrests, and his on-going decision to drive without a license or insurance in violation of law (I.J. at 10-20). While the Immigration Judge did “consider” that the respondent had a conviction for a firearms offense, due to the absence of any records of this “conviction” he did not find that it was an aggravated felony (I.J. at 12, 16, 18). Rather, it was mentioned as one of many factors in his decision. Moreover, the Immigration Judge based his consideration of the case on the respondent’s own testimony that he was arrested in 1990 for possession of a firearm in a drinking establishment, for which he paid a fine (I.J. at 16; Tr. at 42-6). We note that the records submitted with the motion confirm that he was arrested in 1997 and charged with four firearms offenses, all of which were dismissed. The respondent has not explained why he testified otherwise, nor has he addressed any of the numerous other bases for the Immigration Judge’s adverse determinations.
 
*2 In sum, given the record presented, we do not find that the respondent has shown that the result of his case would have been different if former counsel had submitted records regarding his criminal history. As we find that the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by former counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance, reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not warranted. Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is denied.

IN RE: LUIS MIGUEL PARRA
File: AXXX XX0 127 - Imperial, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Shahid Ali, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reissuance; reopening
 
*1 The respondent’s motion is untimely. The Board entered the final administrative order in these proceedings on October 6, 2011, when it dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent filed his motion to reopen and reissue the Board’s 2011 decision and request for a stay of removal, on February 28, 2014, over 2 years after the Board’s final decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The motion and stay of removal will be denied.
 
The respondent asserts that the Board should reissue its earlier decision because he would like to file a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Motion at 1-2). The Board has on occasion reissued its decisions, but generally only due to Board error or administrative problems involving receipt of the Board’s decision. Federal regulations require the Board to serve its final decision on the alien, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(f). “Service” is defined as either “physically presenting or mailing a document to the appropriate party or parties.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.13.
 
The respondent does not allege that he did not receive the Board’s decision, but rather that the time and numerical limitations for motions to reopen should be tolled because he is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The time and number limits for motions to reopen may be equitably tolled where an alien raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). However, it will only apply where the alien shows that he was prejudiced by his attorney’s conduct. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
The respondent has not complied with any of the Lozada1 procedural requirements. See generally Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893 (9th Cir. 2008). Furthermore, the respondent has not demonstrated that he acted with due diligence in pursuing his claim prior to filing the instant motion on February 28, 2014, over 2 years after the Board’s prior decision. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra, at 897 (holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). Furthermore, we see no reason to exercise our discretion to reopen proceedings sua sponte where the respondent has not articulated any available forms of relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the motion to reopen and reissue our decision and the request for a stay of removal will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reissue is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: JORGE PATRICIO LEMA LEMA
File: AXXX XX7 508 - New York, NY
May 30, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
H. Raymond Fasano, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the August 14, 2013, Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings which had been conducted in absentia on March 22, 2013. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed no reply to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of fact by an Immigration Judge under the clearly erroneous standard of review, and may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
Here, the Notice of Hearing (NOH) for the March 22, 2013, hearing was personally served on the respondent’s former counsel (I.J. at 1; Exh. 2). Notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Garcia v. INS, 222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (notice to counsel sufficient); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a).
 
In his motion, the respondent contends that his former counsel failed to inform the respondent of the hearing. Ineffective assistance of counsel may be an exceptional circumstance warranting rescission of an in absentia removal order. See Aris v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595 (2d Cir. 2008). To succeed on a motion to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien must substantially comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46 (2d Cir. 2005) (requiring substantial compliance with Lozada to preserve an ineffective assistance of counsel claim). Here, although the respondent provided his affidavit with the motion, it does not set forth what agreement, if any, he had with his former counsel. Nor has he fulfilled the other Lozada requirements, as noted by the Immigration Judge, and thus the respondent has failed to substantially comply with the Lozada requirements.
 
We find no merit to the respondent’s appellate contention that the Immigration Judge should have held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the respondent’s previous attorney provided ineffective assistance. The respondent has cited to no authority for this argument, and moreover, given his failure to substantially comply with the Lozada requirements, no evidentiary hearing was warranted.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent now requests that the Board sustain the appeal and remand to allow the respondent to request that DHS exercise its prosecutorial discretion (citing Memorandum from Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton titled “Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion Consistent with the Civil Immigration Enforcement Priorities of the Agency for the Apprehension, Detention, and Removal of Aliens” (June 17, 2011) (hereinafter “Memorandum from ICE Director John Morton”)). Under the Morton Memo, the DHS may exercise prosecutorial discretion at any stage of an enforcement proceeding. Thus, the entry of this order does not prevent the respondent from pursuing such immigration benefits directly from the DHS. See Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 350 (BIA 1982). If the DHS elects to grant the respondent deferred action (or other immigration benefits as a matter of prosecutorial discretion), the parties are not precluded from filing a joint motion to reopen in the future. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(iii). However, we find no basis to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion to reopen.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Deborah Hoover Hupfer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rhana Ishimoto
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 7, 2013, denying her motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for her failure to appear for the scheduled hearing on May 27, 1999. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal the respondent contends that she has established ineffective assistance of counsel for her failure to appear. She asserts that notice was served only on her former counsel, and that she was not provided oral notice of the hearing in her native language. The respondent claims that she has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent also indicates that she was not provided with a transcript of the proceedings. However, a transcript is not ordinarily prepared where a motion to reopen is filed, since the motion will be decided on the basis of its merits rather than on the basis of a review of the record. See Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996) (noting transcript ordinarily not present when motion to reopen filed).
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the alien has satisfied the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). However, in order to equitably toll the filing deadline for a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate that she has exercised due diligence during the entire period she seeks to toll. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that equitable tolling is available when an individual is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud or error, and exercised due diligence in discovering such circumstances).
 
*2 The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed untimely. The respondent has not demonstrated the due diligence required for equitable tolling of the filing deadline based on the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on May 27, 1999, yet she did not seek reopening until January 8, 2013. The respondent does not indicate in her affidavit that she attempted to contact her former counsel after her last appearance in court, and she states that she did not contact another attorney until late 2004. The respondent states on appeal that she made one personal trip to the Immigration Court to inquire about her next hearing date, but the filing windows were closed when she arrived. She has not indicated that she inquired thereafter with the Immigration Court to determine the status of her case. The respondent avers that since becoming aware of the in absentia order of removal in 2005, she has been actively trying to resolve the matter by retaining three different attorneys since then. However, she does not indicate that she attempted to determine the status of her case, or to consult with any other attorneys, between March 1999 and late 2004. The respondent has not met her burden of showing that she had been diligent during the entire period she seeks to toll. See id. at 679 (explaining that if an individual is “ignorant of counsel’s shortcomings, whether petitioner made reasonable efforts to pursue relief is a consideration when assessing diligence). The respondent has not demonstrated that she is entitled to equitable tolling, as she has not established that she acted with due diligence in this matter.
 
Moreover, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent has not established ineffective assistance of counsel. The record reflects that a notice of hearing dated March 3, 1999, was served personally on the respondent in court and she was provided with oral notice of the hearing scheduled for May 27, 1999, and of the adverse consequences of a failure to appear. Both the Record of Master Calendar Hearing and the notice of hearing dated March 3, 1999, contain the respondent’s signature underneath an ink stamp with the words “receipt by respondent,” further verifying that she received actual notice in court. As the respondent was personally served with the notice of hearing in court, she received proper notice of the hearing scheduled for May 27, 1999. See Khan v. Ashcroft, 374 F.3d 825 (9th Cir. 2004) (court held alien’s due process rights were not violated by failing to provide notice in his native language since he had actual notice and was personally served with notice at a hearing). Contrary to the respondent’s contention on appeal, the written notice to the respondent was only required to be provided to the respondent in the English language. In any event, the notice of hearing reflects that the respondent was provided oral notice of the contents of the hearing notice in her native language, or in a language she understands, by the Immigration Judge (Exh. 10). Section 240(e)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1).
 
*3 The Immigration Judge indicates that she listened to the audio tapes of the May 27, 1999, proceedinss, and the respondent’s former counsel did appear for the hearing on that date. The Immigration Judge correctly determined that since the respondent was provided with both written and oral notice in court of the next hearing date, the ineffective assistance claim against her former counsel for failing to provide her notice of the May 27, 1999, hearing is unsubstantiated. The respondent also has not established exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear for the hearing, as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1).1
 
We further find no basis for exercising our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings in this case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
Finally, the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent has not established eligibility for any relief, nor has she submitted any applications for relief. We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: LAI MING MA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Xiaosheng Huang, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kathleen W. Taylor
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of April 10, 2013. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s March 26, 2013, motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia on July 12, 2011. The respondent has proffered evidence and we construe her appellate submission as a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief in opposition to the appeal and motion. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent was provided notice of the date, time, and location of her scheduled hearing before the Immigration Judge. As correctly noted by the Immigration Judge, the Notice to Appear (NTA) was personally served on the respondent (Exh. 1). The written notice of hearing (NOH) was mailed to the respondent, and she does not dispute receipt. In her motion, the respondent alleges that the NTA was stolen from her. However, the fact that the respondent lost or had her NTA stolen subsequent to receipt does not vitiate service.1
 
A motion to reopen alleging exceptional circumstances for a failure to appear at a removal hearing must be filed within 180 days of the order of removal, and only one such motion is allowed. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i) & 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent’s motion claiming that she did not appear at her hearing because the NTA was stolen was properly found untimely, as it was filed well beyond 180 days after the removal order was entered.
 
On appeal, the respondent now alleges that: she was the victim of a second robbery, on April 19, 2011, at which time her NOH was also taken; she suffered an auto accident on April 24, 2011, and since then she has suffered “bad health;” and Mr. Michael Lin, Esquire, who represented her in her “personal injury case,” and who filed the motion to reopen, provided ineffective assistance. (Respondent’s Affidavit, page 1). Regarding her allegations against Mr. Lin, the respondent maintains that he failed to provide evidence with the motion to reopen, and she further alleges that Mr. Lin told her she did not have to appear at her immigration hearing. The respondent included; a copy of a letter to the Nevada Bar Counsel; an undated letter to Mr. Lin; her affidavit; police reports for theft incidents on February 16, 2011, and April 19, 2011; and an April 24, 2011, traffic accident report indicating that the respondent’s car was hit in a parking lot.
 
*2 Before we will consider an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, however, the respondent first must satisfy threshold procedural requirements established in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and adopted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case lies. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 900 (9th Cir. 2003). She must provide “(1) an affidavit by the alien setting forth the agreement with counsel regarding the alien’s representation; (2) evidence that counsel was informed of the allegations and allowed to respond; and (3) an indication that a complaint has been lodged with the bar, or reasons explaining why not.” Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639.
 
In Lozada, we explained that the notice requirement serves both to notify an alien’s former counsel of the ineffective assistance allegations and to give former counsel an opportunity to contest them before the Immigration Judge or Board. The participation of an alien’s former counsel, in turn, provides a mechanism by which the Immigration Judge or Board may more accurately assess the merits of an alien’s ineffective assistance claims. “[T]he potential for abuse is apparent,” we cautioned, “where no mechanism exists for allowing former counsel, whose integrity or competence is being impugned, to present his version of events if he so chooses, thereby discouraging baseless allegations.” Lozada, supra at 639.
 
Here, the respondent’s letter to Mr. Lin did not substantially comply with the Lozada requirement that she notify her former attorney of ineffective assistance allegations and submit any subsequent response from the attorney with the motion. We first note that the letter is not dated. In addition, the letter seeks a refund from Mr. Lin, but does not inform him that a Bar complaint and motion to reopen with the Board were filed. Although the respondent may have put Mr. Lin on notice concerning the substance of her ineffective assistance allegations, if she actually sent Mr. Lin a copy of the complaint letter,2 she offers absolutely no evidence that Mr. Lin received notice of the concomitant motion to reopen and Bar complaint.3 Because the respondent gave Mr. Lin no notice of the motion to reopen and no opportunity to respond to her allegations before the Board, we conclude that the respondent has not substantially satisfied Lozada’s notice requirement. Id. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598 (9th Cir. 2004) (undated letter to prior counsel insufficient to meet notice and opportunity to respond requirements).
 
*3 To the extent the respondent maintains that she sustained injuries preventing her from timely filing a motion to reopen, she has failed to adequately establish she sustained any injuries from her April 24, 2011, auto accident. The report does not indicate any injuries were sustained; nor did the respondent proffer any medical evidence to corroborate her allegation that she is in “bad health.”
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: JUAN MARTINEZ-ALVAREZ
File: AXXX XX9 323 - Dallas, TX
May 29, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frances M. Cruz, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s June 28, 2012, decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed an appeal brief. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
We review the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether or not the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On February 6, 2012, the Immigration Judge denied as abandoned the respondent’s application for adjustment of status because the application was not filed by the court-imposed deadline of February 1, 2012. By separate order, also dated February 6, 2012, the Immigration Judge denied a motion to withdraw as counsel and a request for additional time to file applications, which was filed on February 3, 2012. On April 20, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reopen sua sponte pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23, which the Immigration Judge denied on May 14, 2012, for failure to pay the filing fee for motions. A subsequent motion to reopen was filed on June 20, 2012, which the Immigration Judge denied on June 28, 2012, concluding that the motion was untimely and number-barred, and determining that there was an insufficient basis for sua sponte reopening. The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for sua sponte reopening.
 
“An Immigration Judge may upon his or her motion at any time . . . reopen or reconsider any case in which he or she has made a decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). The power to reopen or reconsider is limited to exceptional situations. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
We find that sua sponte reopening is appropriate in this case. Although the respondent did not fully comply with the evidentiary requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988),1 we note that he did submit an affidavit outlining the circumstances surrounding his representation by the Mathur Law Offices in this case, as well as his attorney fee agreement with the Mathur Law Offices, invoices and case notations from the firm, and attorney email correspondence.
 
*2 The motion to withdraw reflects that the respondent hired the Mathur Law Offices, and was assigned Cristobal Colindres as his attorney. The motion further states that Mr. Colindres ended his employment at the Mathur Law Offices on September 19, 2011, and that after his departure, he notified the firm that motions to substitute as counsel should be filed in all of his pending cases, including the respondent’s case, and that if pending filing deadlines were not met, his clients could have their claims denied as abandoned. In requesting to withdraw from the case and in seeking additional time for the respondent to file his application, Mr. Colindres noted that he received information from a court clerk on February 3, 2012, that the Mathur Law Offices had filed motions to substitute as counsel in all of his pending cases except the respondent’s case. Email correspondence between Mr. Colindres and representatives at the Mathur Law Offices, filed with the motion to withdraw and with the motion to reopen, confirms that in January 2012, before the filing deadline, Mr. Colindres inquired about the status of the motions to substitute and was told, incorrectly, that they had been filed in all of his pending cases. The respondent states in his affidavit that he last met with Attorney Mathur at the Mathur Law Offices on November 18, 2011, and that while he was informed that Mr. Colindres no longer worked for the firm, he was not informed about the need to file his applications with the court by February 1, 2012.
 
The evidence in the record therefore reflects that the respondent’s legal representation with the Mathur Law Offices was in transition shortly before the filing deadline, and that the Mathur Law Offices did not file a motion to substitute counsel after Mr. Colindres left the firm or submit the respondent’s application by the February 1, 2012, deadline. Based on the particular circumstances of this case, we thus conclude that sua sponte reopening is appropriate so that the respondent may have his application for adjustment of status considered on the merits. See Matter of J-J-, supra. Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.2
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

File: AXXX XX6 495 - Charlotte, NC
April 29, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jaime Jasso, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Susan Lecker
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the July 27, 2012, decision of the Immigration Judge denying his motion to reconsider. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On March 19, 2012, the respondent, through counsel, requested and was granted pre-conclusion voluntary departure with an alternate order of removal. He subsequently filed a motion to reopen proceedings on June 29, 2012, which the Immigration Judge denied, inter alia, because it was untimely, and the respondent claimed ineffective assistance of counsel, but had not complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741, 748 (4th Cir. 2006).
 
The respondent subsequently filed a motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider must specify “[e]rrors of fact or law in the prior decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C). A party seeking reconsideration requests that the original decision be reexamined in light of alleged factual or legal errors, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57-58 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402-03 (BIA 1991).
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s subsequent motion to reconsider because it did not identify an error of law or fact in the prior decision (Decision on a Motion, July 27, 2012). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, supra; Matter of Cerna, supra. On appeal, the respondent largely raises the same or similar arguments. However, we have considered those arguments and find them unpersuasive when viewed within the record as a whole before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 58 (a motion to reconsider is not a process by which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief presented on appeal and seek reconsideration). The respondent’s disagreement with the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen did not provide a basis for a motion to reconsider. See id. The Immigration Judge did not err in finding that the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely, and that he failed to comply with the procedural requirements to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Nor did the respondent demonstrate a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel that was sufficient to waive the Lozada requirements. See Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133 (2d Cir. 2007) (persuasive authority). Therefore we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reconsider.
 
*2 We also uphold the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen as a matter of discretion (I.J. Order of July 13, 2012). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of Barrera, 19 I&N Dec. 837, 844 (BIA 1989). The regulation states that “[t]he Immigration Judge has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the moving party has established a prima facie case for relief.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). For the foregoing reasons the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: DAVID KIRWA KURGAT
File: AXXX XX3 420 - Kansas City, MO
April 25, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher B. McKinney, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Justin Howard
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)] - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
 
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; continuance; voluntary departure
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 28, 2012, decision denying the respondent’s request for a continuance, pretermitting his application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), and denying his application for voluntary departure. During the pendency of his appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion will be granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
Through his motion, the respondent contends that he should be permitted to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act because his application was pretermitted by the Immigration Judge due to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Respondent’s Motion at 5-9. According to the respondent, his prior counsel failed to complete and submit a Form I-864 Affidavit of Support despite the fact that he had provided prior counsel with his entire file and his sponsor had provided prior counsel with all of the necessary documentation to complete the form via fax prior to the respondent’s proceedings on March 28, 2012, resulting in pretermission of his application. See id. at 6. The respondent further claims that prior counsel advised him that a continuance would be granted at the hearing on March 28, 2012, such that his witnesses need not appear in court. See id. As such, the respondent alleges that he provided prior counsel with all of the necessary information needed to complete the adjustment of status application but prior counsel failed to do so, instead relying on a request for a continuance at the March 28, 2012, hearing. See id. at 5-9.
 
A successful motion based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy two conditions. First, the claim must comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Briefly, the Lozada requirements are (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit detailing counsel’s failings, (2) that counsel be informed of the allegations, and (3) that the motion show that disciplinary charges have been filed with the appropriate authority, or if not, adequately explain why not. Id. Second, the alien “““must also show that he or she was prejudiced by the actions or inactions of counsel.” See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003). In this case, the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 As to the issue of prejudice, the respondent claims that he and his sponsor provided all of the information needed to complete the Affidavit of Support prior to the March 28, 2012, hearing. In his response, prior counsel submitted evidence showing that the sponsor faxed to him, inter alia, a summary of her prior year’s tax return and an employment letter.1 However, prior counsel claims that for various reasons this information was insufficient to complete the Affidavit of Support. Along with his motion, the respondent has provided an affidavit from the sponsor. In her affidavit, the sponsor states she was told by prior counsel that he had received her documents and that he was going to file the Affidavit of Support before the next hearing. Thus, the respective claims in regard to this sponsor by the respondent and prior counsel are in contradiction.
 
The respondent also asserts through his motion that he provided prior counsel with his entire file from a previous counsel before the March 28, 2012, hearing. In this regard, prior counsel states in his responses to both the respondent and the bar officials that he did not receive the file until after the March 28, 2012, proceedings. For his part, the respondent provided a fax he sent to prior counsel from detention on February 15, 2012, and states that, along with that fax, he faxed over his entire file. While the fax submitted was only a page in length, it refers to a purported previous fax, and on the next page is a letter dated February 17, 2012, saying “I hereby fax to you” the respondent’s conviction records. Again, as to this issue, the respective claims by the respondent and prior counsel are in contradiction.
 
The respondent also asserts that prior counsel advised him that court appearances by his witnesses were not necessary on March 28, 2012, on the basis of a request for a continuance. See Respondent’s Motion at 6. In this regard, the respondent has provided affidavits from these witnesses stating their understanding that prior counsel had indicated that they need not attend the March 28, 2012, hearing. However, prior counsel disputes this claim vigorously in his responses, asserting that he would never advise a client in this way because he could never know that an Immigration Judge would in fact grant a continuance. Again, the facts on the issue are in dispute.
 
Under these circumstances, we conclude that for purposes of the instant appeal and motion, the respondent has met his burden of establishing a prima facie ineffective assistance of counsel claim, requiring a remand to the Immigration Judge to determine the truth in regard to the various issues and claims by both the respondent and prior counsel. In this regard, on remand, the Immigration Judge should develop the record and find facts pertinent to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The Immigration Judge should also consider the respondent’s arguments on appeal that he misstated the respondent’s criminal record in denying voluntary departure. In this regard, we also note that it is incumbent on the Immigration Judge to balance all of the favorable and unfavorable facts in assessing the respondent’s moral character and in exercising discretion.
 
*3 Accordingly, the motion will be granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Neil St. John Rambana, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John Gihon
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the January 10, 2013, Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings which had been conducted in absentia on November 4, 2008. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of fact by an Immigration Judge under the clearly erroneous standard of review, and may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent filed a motion to reopen in absentia proceedings on December 13, 2012, alleging ineffective assistance by former counsel Mr. James Tipler. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, noting that the record reflected that the respondent was represented by Mr. Jeffery Toney in these immigration proceedings.
 
A motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273-74 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).
 
On appeal, the respondent has proffered new evidence pertaining to his allegation that Mr. Jeffery Toney provided ineffective legal assistance. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case lies, has held that an alien seeking to show ineffective assistance must meet each of the three screening requirements of Lozada, even where counsel’s ineffective assistance was clear on the record. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir. 2003). While the respondent included an affidavit from his wife on appeal, detailing his former attorney’s allegedly ineffective representation, thus satisfying the first procedural requirement of Lozada, he failed to comply with Lozada’s second and third prongs. The respondent did not submit, in support of his motion to reopen, any information to the Immigration Judge or to the Board on appeal, showing that he had notified Mr. Toney of the allegations and that a complaint has been filed with the relevant Florida disciplinary authorities.1 Id. Therefore, reopening is not warranted as the respondent failed to comply sufficiently with Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Although the respondent proffered letters from the Florida State Attorney’s office indicating that the respondent was victimized by Mr. Tipler, and that Mr. Toney was associated with Mr. Tipler, there is no indication that the respondent has filed a complaint with the Florida Bar against Mr. Toney.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pierre I. Eloi, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Gabriel A. Couriel
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the March 18, 2013, Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings which had been conducted in absentia on October 3, 2011. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of fact by an Immigration Judge under the clearly erroneous standard of review, and may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent filed a motion to reopen in absentia proceedings on November 26, 2012,1 alleging ineffective assistance by his former counsel.2 The Immigration Judge denied the motion, noting, inter alia, that the respondent’s former counsel appeared at the October 3, 2011, hearing and stated that he had notified the respondent of his hearing. The Immigration Judge further found that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel and he had failed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Here, the Notice of Hearing (NOH) was mailed to the respondent’s former counsel (Exh. 3), and he appeared at the October 3, 2011, hearing. Notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
Although the respondent asserts that his absence from the hearing was attributable to the ineffectiveness of his former attorney, as noted by the Immigration Judge, he has not alleged or shown that he complied with any of the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir. 2000); Soadjede v. Ashcroft, 324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir. 2003). See also Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644 (5th Cir. 2014) (holding that the requirement, for raising claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, that counsel have been informed of the allegations and allowed to respond, is only met when counsel is informed of the charge before allegations of ineffective assistance are presented to Board).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent argues that his case was not properly analyzed under Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). We find no merit to this contention. Notice was properly provided to the respondent’s counsel. His counsel indicated that he had notified the respondent. Thus, it is the respondent’s burden to establish his former counsel provided ineffective assistance, and he has failed to do so in accordance with Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: JATINDER SINGH
File: AXXX XX2 930 - Harlingen, TX
March 31, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Genet Getachew, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 11, 2013. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on July 11, 2011. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On September 23, 2010, the Notice to Appear (NTA) was personally served on the respondent. The NTA advised the respondent of the consequences of failing to appear for his removal hearing. On October 29, 2010, the respondent was released from the custody of the Department of Homeland Security. Upon his release, the respondent provided the Immigration Court with an address in New York at which he could be served. On November 30, 2010, a Notice of Hearing (NOH) was mailed to the respondent’s counsel of record. The NOH notified the respondent that he was scheduled to appear for a hearing on July 11, 2011.
 
On April 4, 2011, the respondent’s former counsel, Norma Sepulveda, Esquire, moved to withdraw from this matter. In the motion, Ms. Sepulveda stated that she had sent a copy of the NOH to the address the respondent had provided in New York, and she had called the respondent at the phone number he had provided. Despite these attempts, Ms. Sepulveda was unable to contact the respondent.
 
On July 11, 2011, the respondent did not appear for his hearing. On that date, the Immigration Judge granted Ms. Sepulveda’s motion to withdraw and ordered the respondent removed in absentia. On February 15, 2013, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings and rescind the in absentia order. The Immigration Judge denied the motion and this appeal followed.
 
The respondent had proper notice of the removal hearing pursuant to sections 239(a)(2), (c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229(a)(2), (c), because the NOH was mailed to his former counsel, Ms. Sepulveda. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). Further, the respondent’s motion is untimely because it was filed more than 180 days after the in absentia order was entered. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i).
 
*2 The respondent nevertheless argues that the 180-day deadline is subject to equitable tolling due to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Specifically, the respondent asserts that Ms. Sepulveda did not inform him of the July 11, 2011, hearing. The respondent also argues that equitable tolling is warranted because, after he learned of the in absentia order, the respondent hired an attorney1 to file a motion to reopen proceedings on his behalf, but this attorney never filed the motion.
 
However, the respondent’s motion does not demonstrate that he has informed Ms. Sepulveda, or the attorney who promised to file a motion to reopen on his behalf, of their alleged defective representation and allowed them to respond. Id. at 639. The motion merely contains certified mail receipts of correspondence sent to both attorneys. The motion does not contain what was actually sent to these attorneys. Similarly, the respondent has not shown that he lodged a complaint with disciplinary authorities regarding former counsel or the attorney hired to file the motion to reopen. Id. The motion only contains a certified mail receipt of correspondence sent to the Chief Disciplinary Counsel in Austin, Texas. The motion does not contain what was sent to this office. As a consequence, the respondent has not established that he has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. See Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647-48 (5th Cir. 2014) (holding that an alien must strictly comply with the Lozada requirements). We therefore find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion is untimely because the respondent has not shown that equitable tolling is warranted in this instance. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. Further, the respondent’s motion does not demonstrate an exceptional situation that would warrant reopening his proceedings under either the Immigration Judge’s or this Board’s sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Royal F. Berg, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Colleen Peppard
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 21, 2013. The Immigration Judge denied as untimely the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. On appeal, the respondent urges that his motion was timely, and further that he established exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear at his hearing. The Department of Homeland Security submitted a response to the respondent’s appeal, agreeing with the respondent’s appellate argument that his motion was timely, and indicating its non-opposition to a remand for the Immigration Judge to consider whether the respondent established exceptional circumstances. The DHS further urged that the respondent had not established exceptional circumstances. We will sustain the appeal and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further fact-finding.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion as untimely, inasmuch as he found that the motion was filed more than 180 days after his in absentia order. However, the record reflects that the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed on October 31, 2013, less than 180 days after his May 7, 2013, in absentia order, and he raised a claim of exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Accordingly, we conclude that the respondent’s motion is timely, and we will vacate the Immigration Judge’s decision finding otherwise.
 
While the respondent demonstrated that he timely filed the present motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia removal order, he must also demonstrate that his failure to appear at his hearing was because of exceptional circumstances, which may include ineffective assistance of counsel. See id. The respondent asserted in his motion that his attorney1 received the Notice of Hearing of the May 7, 2013, hearing date; however, his attorney did not inform him of his hearing date.2 The Immigration Judge, however, did not make any findings of fact with respect to whether the respondent established exceptional circumstances. Given our limited fact-finding ability on appeal, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for consideration of whether the respondent established exceptional circumstances to explain his failure to appear at his May 7, 2013, hearing. See Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994) (finding that an Immigration Judge must fully explain the reasons for denying a motion in order to allow the respondent a fair opportunity to contest the decision and the Board an opportunity for meaningful appellate review); see also Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468, 477 (BIA 1999). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained and the Immigration Judge’s November 21, 2013, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: These removal proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further consideration of the respondent’s motion to reopen consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT:
 
Jose Alfredo Hernandez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On December 17, 2013, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his application for adjustment of status. On January 23, 2014, the respondent moved the Board to reopen the proceedings. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent seeks reopening for further consideration of his application for adjustment of status based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against David M. Paz Soldan, the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). The motion will be denied.
 
A party who seeks to reopen proceedings to pursue relief previously considered bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated that an inquiry into whether counsel provided ineffective assistance must begin by determining whether competent counsel would have acted otherwise before examining whether an alien was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective actions of counsel. See Maravilla-Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004). In addition, “substantial prejudice” must be established and such prejudice means that an alien must show that the alleged ineffectiveness may have affected the outcome of proceedings. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004), amended 404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir. 2005); Lata v. I.N.S., 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
During his removal hearing, the respondent sought adjustment of status based on a visa petition filed on his behalf in 1991, and approved in 1992. At the hearing, however, the Department of Homeland Security introduced evidence that by 1997 the visa petition been terminated pursuant to section 203(g) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1153(g). See Exhibit 13. Inasmuch as a visa was not immediately available to the respondent, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s application for relief. See section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a).
 
*2 In the instant motion, the respondent claims that Attorney Paz Soldan, whom he engaged in 2008, did not properly argue that the termination of the visa was improper because the respondent did not receive notice of the visa’s termination.1
 
As we emphasized in our prior decision, arguments regarding the termination of a visa under section 203(g) of the Act are not reviewable in removal proceedings. The respondent has not cited to any authority that holds that section 203(g) rulings are reviewable in removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R.§§ 245.2(a)(1), (a)(5)(ii); Singh v. Clinton, 618 F.3d 1085 (9th Cir. 2010); Zixiang Li v. Kerry, 710 F.3d 995 (9th Cir. 2013); Matter of Aurelio, 19 I&N Dec. 458 (BIA 1987). Therefore, regardless of whether the termination of the visa was improper, a visa was not immediately available to the respondent at the time of his removable hearing. Hence, the respondent could not establish prima facie eligibility for the relief. Under the circumstances, the fact that Attorney Paz Soldan did not argue that the visa’s termination was improper did not constitute prejudicial error as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel in these removal proceedings.2 See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, supra.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

It appears that the Department of State notified the respondent’s former attorney, Charles T. Hindley, Esquire, of the visa’s termination.

Insofar at the respondent alleges that Attorney Paz Soldan failed to properly prepare for the removal hearing, we note that the Immigration Judge described the respondent’s case for adjustment of status as “well-documented,” and noted that the respondent (through counsel) objected to the introduction of the evidence of the visa’s termination. See Immigration Judge’s Decision at 2.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rosaura Gonzalez Rucci, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jose Rivera
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent, a native of the Dominican Republic and a citizen of the Netherlands Antilles, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, mailed July 20, 2012, denying her motion to reconsider. The Department of Homeland Security is opposed to the respondent’s appeal. The record will remanded.
 
On March 7, 2012, the respondent appeared before the Immigration Judge and was granted the privilege of voluntarily departing the United States on or before July 5, 2012. See section 240B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c. On April 9, 2012, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen claiming ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to the processing of an immigrant visa petition her husband had filed on her behalf.1 The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen in a decision mailed on April 24, 2012. On May 22, 2012, the respondent moved for reconsideration. The Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reconsider is the subject of the present appeal.
 
A motion to reconsider is an alien’s opportunity to specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and not an opportunity to present new evidence, nor an opportunity to reiterate or expand upon arguments that have been previously raised and considered. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). While the Act, vis-à-vis a motion to reopen, allows an alien who is subject to an order of removal to present new evidence, the respondent used her single opportunity to present new evidence when she filed her initial motion to reopen on April 9, 2012. See section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A). As such, to the extent that the respondent attached evidence to her motion to reconsider and has presented evidence to this Board on appeal, we conclude that the presentation of said evidence subsequent to the filing of the respondent’s motion to reopen is number-barred. See Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000).
 
While the presentation of additional evidence is number-barred, we conclude that it is appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge in order to further consider the merits of the respondent’s motion to reconsider. In denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider, the Immigration Judge found no legal or factual error in her prior conclusion that the respondent had not complied with the evidentiary standards set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Under Matter of Lozada, a motion to reopen based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not.
 
*2 Here, in support of reopening, the respondent presented a personal affidavit, a copy of a complaint letter addressed to the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands, and, through counsel, indicated that the complaint letter had been filed and her former counsel had been informed of the complaint being filed. In her motion to reconsider, the respondent identified evidence that she had previously offered in support of reopening and argued that her motion to reopen substantially complied with Lozada’s evidentiary requirements. The Immigration Judge, in denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider, faulted her for not presenting evidence that the complaint letter had been actually filed and questioned whether it was proper to file a letter with the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands (as opposed Virgin Islands Bar Association) (I.J. at 1).
 
The Lozada requirements are meant to serve as a threshold and a screening mechanism to help Immigration Judges and this Board assess the substantial number of ineffective assistance claims that they receive, but need not be rigidly enforced where their purpose is fully served by other means. Fadiga v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 488 F.3d 142, 156 (3d Cir. 2007). “[O]nly in rare circumstances have courts refused to reopen immigration proceedings solely because [an alien] failed to file a bar complaint.” Xu Yong Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 134 (3rd Cir. 2001). However, in the present case, the Immigration Judge appears to have concluded that the respondent was required to strictly comply with Lozada in order to have her claims considered. As the respondent need only establish that the evidentiary requirements set forth in Lozda have been fully served by other means, we will remand the record for the Immigration Judge to further consider the issue of whether the respondent has sufficiently complied with the threshold evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada such that the underlying merits of her ineffective assistance of counsel claims should be considered.
 
In her decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge also held that the respondent had not established that the result in this case would have been different if the errors had not occurred. See Fadiga v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 159 (holding that an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings must show that there was a “““reasonable likelihood that the result would have been different if the claimed error had not occurred”); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638 (“One must show, moreover, that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance.”). However, the Immigration Judge did not address this prior holding in her decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reconsider. We observe that, in support of her claim that she was prejudiced by her former counsel, the respondent argued in her motion to reconsider that her motion to reopen contained approximately 70 pages of evidence concerning the bona fides of her marriage and said evidence was not considered by the Immigration Judge in her decision denying the motion to reopen. As such, upon remand, the Immigration Judge should, among other things, further determine whether the respondent demonstrated legal or factual error in her prior holding that the respondent was not prejudiced by her former counsel.
 
*3 For the reasons set forth above, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the respondent’s motion to reconsider.2

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Susan Church, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s October 29, 2013, decision denying his request for a continuance and ordering him removed from the United States. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This case was last before the Board on September 11, 2013, when we dismissed as untimely the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s July 1, 2013, decision finding him removable as charged and denying his request for a continuance. The record reflects that the respondent sought a reissued decision from the Immigration Judge, and the Immigration Judge reissued his July 1, 2013, decision on October 29, 2013. The respondent thereafter filed a timely appeal. On appeal, the respondent contends that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel during his proceedings and that a continuance is warranted to allow him to pursue collateral attacks on his criminal conviction because the lab that was involved in his conviction has been accused of misconduct. Specifically, on July 22, 2010, the respondent was convicted for the offense of distribution of cocaine in Massachusetts (I.J. at 1-2; Exhs. 2 and 3).
 
A successful motion based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy two conditions. First, the claim must comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Briefly, the Lozada requirements are (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit detailing counsel’s failings, (2) that counsel be informed of the allegations, and (3) that the motion show that disciplinary charges have been filed with the appropriate authority. Id. Second, the alien “must also show that he or she was prejudiced by the actions or inactions of counsel.” See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003).
 
In this case, the respondent contends that prior counsel was ineffective because he failed to appear in Immigration Court on a few occasions, failed to timely file an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s original decision, and failed to pursue relief on behalf of the respondent. See Respondent’s Brief at 2-4 and 8). In support of his assertions, the respondent has submitted a copy of a letter addressed to the Massachusetts Board of Bar Overseers dated February 18, 2014, and a copy of a letter addressed to prior counsel dated February 19, 2014, providing him with a copy of the letter to the Bar Overseers and notifying him that the letter was “scheduled to be sent.” See Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent also asserts that his is an “extreme case” negating the need to show prejudice and that prior counsel should have pursued withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and protection under the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16-.18 (2013), based on the fact that he is the only potential kidney donor for his father. See Respondent’s Brief at 8.
 
*2 Notwithstanding the respondent’s contentions on appeal, we find he has not met his burden in establishing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Specifically, under the circumstances of this case, the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by any actions and/or inactions of prior counsel. See Matter of Assaad, supra. As to the respondent’s contention that prior counsel failed to file a timely appeal resulting in the Board’s dismissal of that appeal on September 11, 2013, we point out that the respondent was able to get the Immigration Judge to reissue his decision and he thereafter timely appealed. Further, as to the respondent’s assertion that prior counsel should have sought withholding of removal and/or protection under the Convention Against Torture, we note that the respondent’s basis for his claims is that he is the only potential kidney donor for his father and this does not form a valid basis for those types of relief and protection. In addition, the record reflects that the respondent was able to obtain a stay of removal after the Immigration Judge reissued his decision on October 29, 2013, in order to seek medical testing. The respondent’s remaining arguments in this regard relate to his prior counsel’s actions during his criminal proceedings; a matter over which we have no jurisdiction. Thus, the respondent has not shown that the result of his prior proceedings would have been any different but for the actions of his prior counsel. See id.
 
The respondent next contends that the Immigration Judge erred in not granting his request for a continuance so that he could pursue a collateral attack on his drug conviction. See Respondent’s Brief at 5-7. The respondent contends that his drug conviction “stems” from malfeasance and misconduct by the laboratory that conducted tests on the evidence in his criminal case. See id. However, the respondent concedes that his motion to set aside his conviction based on these assertions was denied by the criminal court. See id. at 6. While the respondent maintains that he intends to file a motion to reconsider with the criminal court, he has not submitted evidence indicating that he has done so or that his criminal conviction has otherwise been vacated or set aside. See id. As found by the Immigration Judge, the respondent’s criminal conviction remains final for immigration purposes. Under these circumstances, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s request for an additional continuance (I.J. at 2). See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983) (alien must show good cause for continuance).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ify J. Ugbala, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John Donovan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 At a hearing held on January 30, 2012, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s request for voluntary departure. The respondent timely filed a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, which the Immigration Judge denied on March 23, 2012. The respondent’s appeal from that decision will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen, for the reasons set forth in her decision. Although the respondent complied with the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), he did not establish that his former attorney’s actions were prejudicial to his case. See id. at 640; see also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 167 (5th Cir. 2006); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). At the time of his final hearing, the respondent was not prima facie eligible for any form of relief aside from voluntary departure. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services had denied the visa petition filed on the respondent’s behalf by his United States citizen wife; the Immigration Judge did not have jurisdiction over any appeal from that decision. Moreover, as the Immigration Judge noted, the pendency of any such appeal would not have established good cause for a further continuance of the respondent’s removal proceedings (I.J. at 2). Insofar as the respondent asserts on appeal that his former attorney erred by failing to file a motion to terminate proceedings, we note that in fact his former attorney did file such a motion on September 13, 2011, and it was denied on the merits by the Immigration Judge. In light of the foregoing, as the respondent was not shown to have experienced actual prejudice by his previous attorney’s actions, we agree with the Immigration Judge that he did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel so as to warrant reopening of his proceedings. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640; Matter of Assaad, supra.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Julie Goldberg, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, mailed December 13, 2013, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand.
 
Due to the respondent’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, we conclude that the record should be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of his claims to reopening. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In particular, upon remand, the Immigration Judge should further consider (1) whether the respondent has now established that rescission of the in absentia order of removal, entered on December 14, 2005, is warranted on account of lack of notice, (2) whether he has now established that changed country conditions in El Salvador warrant reopening in order to allow him to pursue an Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal (Form I-589), and (3) whether he has now established that sua sponte reopening is warranted. See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(ii), (c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii), (c)(7)(C)(ii); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). While we conclude that the respondent has established that the Immigration Judge should have an additional opportunity to consider his claims to reopening, we express no opinion regarding the underlying merits of his claims to reopening at the present time. The following order is entered.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Wayne Spindler, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 24, 2013. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was charged with being removable for being present in the United States without having been admitted or paroled (Exh. 1). The respondent (through counsel) admitted the factual allegations in the Notice to Appear and conceded removability as charged (Tr. at 7). The respondent requested no relief from removal. He requested only pre-conclusion voluntary departure, and the Immigration Judge granted that relief (Tr. at 8-10).
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in not considering him for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.1 The respondent argues that, despite his express concession of ineligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture, and despite his express agreement to forgo all relief, he wished to be considered for relief from removal.
 
First, we note that, at the hearing, the respondent (through counsel) indicated that the respondent had no fear of return to El Salvador (Tr. at 8). Second, we note that counsel for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) advised the Immigration Judge (and the respondent) that he had twice been granted TPS, had it expire in 2003 and 2006, had not thereafter renewed it, and had been convicted of a misdemeanor assault (Tr. at 8).2 In response to this, the respondent did not request TPS or request a continuance to consider applying for TPS. Third, the respondent was present at that hearing and personally indicated that he agreed to waive all applications for relief from removal in order to be granted pre-conclusion voluntary departure (Tr. at 9). We conclude that the waiver of relief is binding on the respondent. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal concession made by counsel is binding on the alien). Cf. Hoodho v. Holder, 558 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir. 2009) (holding that facts admitted by a party are “judicial admissions” that bind that party throughout the litigation). Moreover, we note that the respondent does not assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lynsay Gott, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ian D. Fiske
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s May 20, 2013, written decision which denied his motion to rescind his in absentia removal order. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has requested summary affirmance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues involving questions of law, judgment and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993).
 
Following a hearing conducted in absentia on June 23, 2009, at which the respondent failed to appear and the DHS presented evidence, an Immigration Judge found him subject to removal as charged, determined that he had abandoned all potential applications for relief, and ordered him removed from the United States. See generally section 240 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a.
 
On December 4, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reopen in which he alleged that his prior counsel had failed to notify him about the June 23, 2009, hearing. He claimed that he had difficulty communicating with his attorney in the time period preceding the hearing, and that he did not understand what his attorney’s assistant meant when she told him that his case had been “closed” because he failed to attend the hearing when she contacted him shortly after the June 2009 hearing. The respondent also alleged that his attorney’s representation was deficient in other respects, and that he had committed ineffective assistance of counsel, although he declined to file a bar complaint because of his “limited financial capacity.” He attached a letter from his prior attorney dated October 10, 2012, in which the attorney reiterated his statement made to the Immigration Judge at the June 23, 2009, hearing that he had spoken with the respondent 1 week before to remind him about the hearing (Exh. S). Finally, he attached a copy of an informal admonition issued by the District of Columbia bar counsel against this attorney in 2003 in connection with an unrelated immigration matter (Exh. T).
 
*2 The DHS filed a response in opposition to the motion to reopen, noting that the respondent had failed to file a bar complaint and had failed to exercise due diligence to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the motion on May 20, 2013, based upon the reasons set forth in the DHS opposition, notably the respondent’s failure to comply with the standards for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and his “failure to take action for several years” (I.J. at 1).
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that he filed a bar complaint against his prior attorney on May 30, 2013, which was 10 days after the Immigration Judge’s decision, and that he also filed a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge. However, the record does not contain any evidence that the respondent filed a motion to reconsider, and he has not attached a copy of his bar complaint.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent has not established that his absence at the scheduled hearing was the result of a lack of notice because his attorney received proper notice of the hearing. Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996) (alien seeking to reopen in absentia proceedings based upon her unsuccessful communications with attorney about hearing date did not establish exceptional circumstances where she failed to satisfy all of requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (notice to alien’s counsel constitutes notice to alien); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c)(2), 1292.5(a).
 
Turning to the respondent’s request for equitable tolling, it is not clear that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the circuit in which this case arises, would apply equitable tolling in these circumstances. In addition, he does not cite any applicable Fourth Circuit precedent on this issue either in his motion or on appeal. However, in other circuits which have applied equitable tolling when an alien has demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien is required to exercise due diligence, which has not been established on this record. See, e.g., Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006); Bead v. Holder, 703 F.3d 591 (1st Cir. 2013); Neves v. Holder, 613 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 2010); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001).
 
*3 Although the respondent claims that he did not understand what his attorney’s assistant meant when she informed him that his case had been “““closed” in June 2009 for failing to attend his hearing, this information was sufficient to alert him to further inquire about the status of his removal proceeding, and his waiting more than 3 and one half years before he filed a motion to reopen does not represent due diligence. In addition, the record does not contain any evidence that he filed a bar complaint as claimed in 2013, and his prior attorney’s conduct in an unrelated immigration case more than 10 years ago does not, without more, establish that he committed ineffective assistance in the respondent’s case.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Subhash Chandra, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jennifer A. May
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 16, 2012, decision denying her motion to reopen. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
This case was originally before the Immigration Judge on April 10, 2006, when the respondent was granted voluntary departure. Subsequently, on June 5, 2007, the Board returned the record to the Immigration Court without further action, noting the respondent’s then counsel had waived appeal during the proceedings. On April 5, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge alleging she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel during her prior proceedings and that her decision to take voluntary departure was not voluntary. On April 16, 2012, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen in a terse decision. In particular, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion as untimely, noting that she “was receiving legal advice from an attorney after [her original attorney] whom she complains about.” The Immigration Judge summarily concluded there is “nothing to justify [the respondent’s] six year delay before deciding to file [the] motion.”
 
We find that the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion is insufficient. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2013) (de novo review). In particular, the Immigration Judge did not specifically address in any meaningful way the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel or that she did not want voluntary departure, and we consequently cannot properly adjudicate the merits of an appeal of that decision. In this regard, the Immigration Judge did not address any of the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and/or whether the respondent met her burden of proof under Lozada. Nor does the Immigration Judge’s decision reflect any consideration of the respondent’s arguments concerning her reasons for not learning of the alleged ineffective assistance of her first attorney until she had contacted a third attorney (current counsel), her reasons for not contacting current counsel sooner, and her reasons for not making a claim under Lozada against the second attorney that she consulted. We cannot uphold the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely where he did not meaningfully address and/or consider her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel which may excuse the untimeliness of the motion. Thus, we find a remand is warranted for the Immigration Judge to fully consider and adjudicate the arguments made in the respondent’s motion to reopen, as well as her accompanying motion for a change of venue, and to issue a new decision.1
 
*2 Accordingly, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.

However, we find no merit in the respondent’s contention that jurisdiction to adjudicate her motion to reopen resided in the Immigration Court in Chicago, Illinois, rather than Kansas City, Missouri. The record indicates that although an Immigration Judge in Chicago presided over the previous proceedings by televideo, those proceedings were docketed in Kansas City and the parties appeared at the Immigration Court there. Therefore, the Immigration Judge in Kansas City properly adjudicated the respondent’s motion to reopen. The filing instructions to which the respondent cites relate only to the physical location of the Immigration Court with administrative control over the record of proceedings, not to adjudication authority. We recognize that the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has issued decisions addressing proper venue in proceedings conducted by televideo, but those decisions determined the venue for a petition for review in the court of appeals under section 242(b)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(2), rather than the authority to decide a motion to reopen at the administrative agency level. See Cordova-Soto v. Holder, 732 F.3d 789 (7th Cir. 2013); Ramos v. Ashcroft, 371 F.3d 948 (7th Cir. 2004). Nor has the respondent established any prejudice with regard to her apparent contention that the Immigration Judge’s April 16, 2012, decision did not inform her of her right to appeal, inasmuch as she filed a timely appeal of that decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jordan G. Forsythe, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joy Lampley
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)] - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section (212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I))
 
Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 23, 2012, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the scheduled hearing on August 18, 2005. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge committed error and abused his discretion by not considering the lack of notice and the availability of adjustment of status to the respondent. The respondent asserts that he did not receive proper notice of his hearing, and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.1
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear was issued on December 30, 2004, and served personally on the respondent on that date. The respondent appeared for hearings on February 10, 2005, March 17, 2005, and April 7, 2005. During the hearing on April 7, 2005, the respondent received oral and written notice of the next hearing scheduled for June 30, 2005. However, on May 31, 2005, a new notice of hearing was sent to the respondent at his most recent provided address, setting forth the hearing date as August 18, 2005. The Notice to Appear reflects that the respondent received oral and written notice of the consequences of a failure to appear and of the requirement to notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever he changed his address or telephone number during the proceeding. Furthermore, during the proceedings on February 10, 2005, March 17, 2005, and April 7, 2005, the respondent was provided oral and written notice of the hearings and of the consequences of a failure to appear. The record reflects that the notice of hearing dated May 31, 2005, was returned to the Atlanta Immigration Court as “““Attempted - Not Known.” The respondent did not appear for the hearing on August 18, 2005, and the Immigration Judge issued an in absentia order of removal. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on May 2, 2012, seeking reopening of the proceedings sua sponte, based on his eligibility for adjustment of status.
 
*2 The Immigration Judge acknowledged that the notice of hearing sent to the respondent’s address was returned “attempted unknown.” However, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent intentionally moved without providing an address to the Immigration Court or the Department of Homeland Security, thus making his whereabouts unknown to the government and thereby rendering the enforcement of the order of removal to Peru difficult, if not impossible. He stated that the respondent has been a fugitive from justice and appeared only after he married a United States citizen and qualified for a benefit.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the record supports the finding that the respondent moved and did not provide his new address to the Immigration Court. The respondent was advised orally and in writing of the consequences of a failure to appear when he was served personally with the Notice to Appear and when he appeared in Immigration Court at three different hearings. Moreover, from the date of his last appearance in court in April 2005, until the filing of the motion to reopen in May 2012, the respondent did not contact the Immigration Court to determine the status of his case, nor did he seek reopening prior to acquiring eligibility for adjustment of status.2 The respondent did not receive notice of his hearing because he failed to comply with his obligation to provide the Immigration Court with current address information, and there was no record evidence submitted by the respondent showing that the address provided was in fact his mailing address and that he had not moved. The respondent has not established lack of proper notice as the notice of hearing was sent to the most recent address provided by the respondent, and he intentionally moved and failed to notify the court of his new address despite repeated warnings of the consequences of a failure to appear.
 
Therefore, the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed untimely whether the respondent is seeking reopening under the rescission provisions pertaining to in absentia orders of removal, or the general motions to reopen provisions. See Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000); section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(4)(ii), 8 C.F.R. 1003.23(b)(1). Subsequent to the filing of the appeal in this matter, on October 26, 2012, the respondent filed the approval notice of an immediate relative visa petition (Form I-130) filed by his spouse, as a supplemental document to the brief on appeal. The approval of a visa petition filed on the respondent’s behalf does not constitute an “exceptional situation” sufficient to warrant reopening of the respondent’s removal proceedings pursuant to the Board’s sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1977) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship).
 
*3 The respondent also contends on appeal that that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “““exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the alien has satisfied the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). However, the respondent has not complied with any of the Lozada requirements, nor has he submitted any evidence in support of his claim that he exercised due diligence in this matter. See Avila-Santoyo, 713 F.3d 1357 (11th Cir. 2013) (court held that the 90-day deadline to file a motion to reopen is subject to equitable tolling, and reasoning is equally applicable to the 180-day deadline to seek reopening of an in absentia removal order). Therefore, the respondent has not established that reopening is warranted on this basis. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent also claims that the Immigration Judge erred in focusing on his previous asylum application rather than considering only the motion to reopen before the court. However, the record does not contain an asylum application, and the Immigration Judge only mentioned that the respondent indicated at a master calendar hearing on April 7, 2005, that he had no fear of returning to Peru.

We also note that the respondent received oral and written notice of his hearing scheduled for June 30, 2005 (which was later rescheduled), yet he did not appear at the Immigration Court on that date. If he had appeared for the hearing on June 30, 2005, he would have discovered that it had been rescheduled to August 18, 2005.

The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s September 12, 2013, decision denying his motion to reopen the removal proceedings and to rescind an in absentia removal order issued against him on December 8, 2011. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of India, concedes that he is removable from the United States by virtue of his unlawful presence (Respondent’s Br. at 3). The respondent was physically present when he was served the Notice To Appear (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). In the interim, the respondent was released from detention on bond. On March 8, 2011, the Immigration Court issued a written notice of the December 8, 2011, hearing to the respondent’s lawyer (I.J. at 1). Two days prior to the respondent’s removal hearing, respondent’s former counsel filed a motion to withdraw as counsel explaining to the Immigration Judge that she had made numerous unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the respondent, had provided the respondent written advisals of his hearing, had exhausted all reasonable efforts to contact the respondent and that the respondent had made no attempt to contact her (I.J. at 1-2; Motion to Withdraw at 2). Concluding that the respondent had failed to appear for his removal hearing despite having received proper notice thereof, the Immigration Judge ordered him removed in absentia. Section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5) (2000); 8 C.F.R. 1292.5(a) (stating that whenever an alien is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to the attorney of record).
 
In August 2013, the respondent filed a motion in Immigration Court requesting reopening of the removal proceedings and rescission of the Immigration Judge’s in absentia removal order. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. In that motion, the respondent asserted that he had not received notice--from either the Immigration Court or his attorney--of the December 8, 2011, hearing, and also claimed that his former lawyer had provided ineffective assistance of counsel by not informing him that he was required to appear for his hearing or notifying him that an in absentia removal order had been issued against him.
 
In a decision dated September 12, 2013, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, concluding that the respondent had received proper notice of the December 8, 2011, hearing and also finding that his ineffective assistance of counsel claim was deficient despite the fact that he had substantively complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (I.J. at 1-2).1 The respondent’s counsel filed a motion to withdraw after indicating she had made numerous unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the respondent and had provided the respondent with written advisals of his hearing, but that the respondent “made no attempt to contact Counsel” (I.J. at 1-2; Motion to Withdraw at 2; Respondent’s Motion at 33). The Immigration Judge observed that the respondent does not claim that he attempted to contact his former counsel during this period (I.J. at 2).
 
*2 An in absentia removal order may be rescinded only if the alien files a motion to reopen: (1) within 180 days after the date of the removal order in which he establishes that his failure to appear was because of “exceptional circumstances,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act; or (2) at any time in which he establishes that he did not have proper notice of the hearing in which the removal order was entered. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act.
 
The record provides support for the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent had received proper notice--through his counsel of record--of his December 8, 2011, removal hearing. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (recognizing that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5 (notice of hearing sent to an alien’s attorney of record is proper, sufficient notice). Furthermore, even if the respondent could establish “exceptional circumstances” for his failure to appear, his motion to reopen and rescind was filed after the expiration of the 180-day filing deadline set forth at section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. Lastly, the Immigration Judge concluded, and we agree, that sua sponte reopening was not warranted in the respondent’s case (I.J. at 2). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); see also Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216 (5th Cir. 2008).
 
In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the removal proceedings and to rescind his December 8, 2011 2001, in absentia removal order.
 
The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the jurisdiction of the instant case, has not issued a published decision directly adopting the doctrine of equitable tolling in the context of a motion to reopen in absentia proceedings. Cf. Borges v. Gonzales, 402 F.3d 398 (3d Cir.2005) (finding equitable tolling of the statute of limitations for ineffective assistance of counsel is appropriate). Even assuming equitable tolling was available to the respondent, the Immigration Judge determined that he was not entitled to it (I.J. at 1-2).

File: AXXX XX2 564 - San Juan, PR
February 10, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rosaura Gonzalez-Rucci, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The final order of removal in this matter was entered by the Immigration Judge on February 17, 2010. Thereafter, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, which alleged ineffective assistance of counsel by the respondent’s prior attorney. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s subsequent motion to reconsider, and the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen with the Board, again alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and requesting the Board to sua sponte reopen proceedings.
 
The respondent’s current motion is number-barred, was not filed within 90 days of the final order of removal, has not been shown to fall within an exception to the filing requirements, and does not establish any exceptional situation that would warrant reopening sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
The focus of the respondent’s motion is that his former attorney knew that the respondent’s sister had filed a visa petition on the respondent’s behalf in 1995 but did not pursue adjustment of status based on that petition. It is the same claim as the one made in the respondent’s prior motion to reopen. However, the respondent has still not demonstrated that his former attorney’s representation resulted in prejudice because he has still not shown he is eligible for adjustment of status.1 See Muyubisnay-Cungachi v. Holder, 734 F.3d 66 (1st Cir. 2013) (providing that a petitioner bringing an ineffective assistance claim must establish both a deficient performance by counsel and a reasonable probability of prejudice resulting from the former representation); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 640 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The respondent has not submitted documentation that the visa petition filed by his sister was approved.2 The respondent has also not demonstrated that he is eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(i) of the Act. Such a waiver would be necessary in light of findings of fraud concerning the respondent’s marriage. The Immigration Judge’s decisions denying reopening and reconsideration addressed these issues but the respondent’s current motion does not mention them. Because the respondent has not demonstrated eligibility for adjustment of status based on his sister’s visa petition, he has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his former attorney’s failure to pursue this relief. Additionally, he has not demonstrated that sua sponte reopening is warranted.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

The respondent appears to seek adjustment under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i) because he was not admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer, a requirement for adjustment under section 245(a) of the Act (Exh. 1).

A notice submitted by the respondent from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS) confirms that a visa petition on behalf of the respondent was received by USCIS on March 30, 1995. However, the USCIS website still indicates that USCIS has not processed the petition and that there may be a clerical problem involving the petitioner’s address. This issue was noted by the Immigration Judge in her decision denying reconsideration.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bernice Funk, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ryan Kahler
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)] - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)] - Crime involving moral turpitude (Withdrawn)
 
Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)] - Controlled substance violation (Withdrawn)
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent moves the Board pursuant to section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7), and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen his removal proceedings to apply for adjustment of status. In our decision dated July 31, 2013, we dismissed his appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 16, 2012, decision which found him removable as charged above, denied his motion for a continuance, but granted him voluntary departure. We also granted him 30 days voluntary departure. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings filed on October 29, 2013, is timely.1 He alleges ineffective assistance of former counsels (Larry W. Smith and Brenda C. Diaz). In Matter of Compean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (“Compean II”), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General directed the Board to continue to apply the previously established standards for reviewing motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel (pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
The respondent meets the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to allege ineffective assistance of Ms. Diaz. He presents his affidavit and a copy of the complaint filed against Ms. Diaz (in which counsel states that she notified Ms. Diaz of the complaint) [Motion Exhs. B, E]. We have no authority to consider the ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Mr. Smith, whose actions allegedly led to the issuance of the Notice to Appear (Form I-862) against the respondent. Cf. Matter of Compean II, supra, at 3 (concluding that the Board’s discretion to reopen removal proceedings includes the power to consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel based on conduct of counsel that occurred after a final order of removal had been entered).
 
*2 The respondent shows prejudice. See generally Correa-Rivera v. Holder, 706 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir. 2013) (prejudice will be found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings). The respondent was found removable under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), based on two convictions. Section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that any alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of any law of a State relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 802)), other than a single offense involving possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana, is deportable.
 
The first removability conviction is a March 4, 1991, conviction in a California criminal court for using or being under the influence of any specified controlled substance (Exh. 2). Ms. Diaz did not challenge removability based on this conviction (Tr. at 18-19). However, the record of conviction does not identify the controlled substance involved. See Ruiz-Vidal v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 1072, 1076-77 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding that conviction under the California possession statute was not a categorical controlled substance offense because California regulates the possession and sale of many substances not covered by the Controlled Substances Act). Removability has not been shown on the present record.
 
The respondent’s second removability conviction is an October 28, 1993, conviction in a California criminal court for possession of marijuana more than 28.5 grams (Exh. 2). However, the record of conviction does not establish whether the amount involved was for 30 grams or less, or for more than 30 grams. See Rodriguez v. Holder, 619 F.3d 1077, 1079 (9th Cir. 2010); see also Medina v. Ashcroft, 393 F.3d 1063, 1065 n.5 (9th Cir. 2005) (the government bears the burden of establishing that an alien’s conviction does not fall within the exception for possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana). Removability has not been shown on the present record.2 We conclude that the respondent shows prejudice.
 
In sum, the respondent meets the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, and shows prejudice. Because his motion to reopen is timely filed, due diligence is not an issue. We will grant the motion to reopen and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for new determinations on removability under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act and eligibility for adjustment of status.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

Because the respondent filed a motion to reconsider on August 29, 2013, which was prior to the expiration of the 30-day voluntary departure period we granted in our July 31, 2013, decision [Aug. 30, 2013], the grant of voluntary departure was automatically terminated, and the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).

CHARGE:

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 17, 2013. The record reflects that following the respondent’s failure to appear for a scheduled hearing on February 22, 2012, the Immigration Judge issued a written decision, ordering him removed in absentia. On March 8, 2013, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings and rescind the in absentia order, alleging that he failed to appear for the hearing due to a lack of notice (I.J. at 1; Respondent’s Motion at 2-3 and Declaration). Following the Immigration Judge’s April 17, 2013, denial of the respondent’s motion, the respondent filed a timely appeal with the Board. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact by the Immigration Judge for clear error, while all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, are reviewed de novo. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i)-(ii) (2014). Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act. See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161, 165 (BIA 2013).
 
First, the respondent’s motion states that he attended two prior hearings and he therefore had no reason not to appear for the February 22, 2012, hearing (Respondent’s Motion at 2). The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent appeared telephonically with his former attorney for the prior master calendar hearings (i.e., on July 6, 2011, and October 19, 2011) and that both he and his former attorney were notified of the February 22, 2012, hearing orally and by a written notice that was mailed to the attorney’s office (I.J. at 1). See Notice of Hearing, dated October 19, 2011, for February 22, 2012; Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Br. at 2-4. Moreover, the respondent has shown no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that it is uncontroverted that his former attorney received notice of the hearing (I.J. at 1). As recognized by the Immigration Judge, it is well-established that notice to an attorney is imputed to his or her client. See I.J. at 1 (citing, inter alia, Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985)).
 
*2 While the respondent concedes that notice to an attorney is imputed to the attorney’s client, he contends that he has “an extremely limited oral understanding” of English and “did not comprehend the date of the hearing” (Respondent’s Br. at 4). Although the respondent did not raise any issue regarding his limited English skills in his motion or declaration, we find that he has not met his burden--even accepting his contention as to his language difficulty--in demonstrating that he lacked notice for the hearing in question. The regulations define the term “service” as “physically presenting or mailing a document to the appropriate party or parties,” while stating that “a Notice to Appear or Notice of Removal Hearing shall be served to the alien in person, or if personal service is not practicable, shall be served by regular mail to the alien or the alien’s attorney of record.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.13. Here, the record reflects that the Notice of Removal Hearing for February 22, 2012, was mailed to the respondent’s attorney of record who was authorized to represent him at that time (I.J. at 1). See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.4(a). Such notice to his former attorney constitutes notice of the scheduled hearing to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a); see also Dominguez-Capistran v. Gonzales, 438 F.3d 876, 878 (8th Cir. 2006) (holding that because the petitioner’s attorney “was properly served notice,” the petitioner is deemed to have been given sufficient notice and that “[t]his is true despite [her attorney’s] poor calendaring and failure to personally remind [her] of her hearing date”).
 
The respondent also argues on appeal that his affidavit must be accepted as truthful by the Immigration Judge unless it is “inherently unbelievable” and that a sworn affidavit stating “that neither he nor a responsible party residing at his address received notice should ordinarily be sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery” (Respondent’s Br. at 3-4). However, the respondent has cited to no binding case law or other legal authority to support such arguments. Also, the respondent has not refuted the Immigration Judge’s holding that his claim of not receiving notice from his prior attorney of the February 22, 2012, hearing was not supported by any attempt to meet the procedural requirements under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 2). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). We also find that the record here does not demonstrate a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance. See Habchy v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 858, 864 (8th Cir. 2006) (noting the absence of “a formal complaint against the lawyer, or at least some explanation why Habchy did not take such action”).
 
*3 In sum, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. Further, as the respondent has not established any legal or clear factual error in the Immigration Judge’s decision, we find no basis to reopen or remand this matter for any reason. Accordingly, based on the foregoing, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: FERNANDO REYES-BERNAL A.K.A. FERNANDO REYEZ
File: AXXX XX8 023 - Salt Lake City, Utah
January 31, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Skyler Anderson, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 16, 2013. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondents September 9, 2013, motion to reopen the proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on August 26, 2013, pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A) (I.J. at 1-2). On appeal the respondent argues that his failure to appear was attributable to “exceptional circumstances” (Respondent’s Br. at 6-14). See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) and 240(e)(1) of the Act (defining “exceptional circumstances”). Specifically, the respondent contends that his failure to attend the August 26, 2013, hearing was attributable to the ineffective assistance of his former counsel.1 See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). However, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
In the respondent’s affidavit submitted in support of the motion to reopen, the respondent asserts that he misunderstood his former attorney’s statement - provided with the aid of a translator - that he would “represent” him in these removal proceedings as an indication that he did not have to attend the master calendar hearing on August 26, 2013 (Respondent’s M.T.R. at Tab B). However, the respondent concedes that his former attorney did not instruct him not to attend the August 26, 2013, hearing (Respondent’s M.T.R. at Tab B).
 
Similarly, the affidavit submitted by the respondent’s former attorney reflects that he told the respondent that, if retained, he would “represent him in immigration court” (Respondent’s M.T.R. at Tab C). The affidavit submitted by the respondent’s former attorney further reflects that he did not “at any time tell him [the respondent] he did not need to go to court” (Respondent’s M.T.R. at Tab C). The respondent’s former attorney did not appear at the August 26, 2013, hearing because, after the respondent retained him, he failed to record the August 26, 2013, hearing in his office calendar (Respondent’s M.T.R. at Tab C).
 
“Exceptional circumstances” are defined as “circumstances (such as battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien, serious illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” See section 240(e)(1) of the Act. The respondent’s misunderstanding as to the attorney’s representation in this case is not an exceptional circumstance.2 Cf. Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996) (“An order of deportation issued following a hearing conducted in absentia may be rescinded under section 242B(c)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3) (Supp. V 1993), where an alien properly establishes that his failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel which amounts to ‘exceptional circumstances’ within the meaning of section 242B(f)(2) of the Act.”). The respondent acknowledges having notice of the hearing and concedes that his former attorney did not give him erroneous instruction not to attend the August 26, 2013, hearing. The former attorney’s failure to record the hearing date in his office calendar may explain the attorney’s absence at the August 26, 2013, hearing, but it does not excuse the respondent’s absence from Immigration Court on that date. Even if the attorney had appeared and the respondent did not, the Immigration Judge was authorized to proceed in absentia and the respondent’s assumption that Immigration Judge would have continued the hearing under these circumstances is speculative.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Labi M. Akere, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Susan Lecker
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Kenya, timely appeals a June 25, 2012, decision by the Immigration Judge denying reopening of his April 9, 2012, decision which granted the respondent post-conclusion voluntary departure with an alternate order of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) opposes the appeal. In a February 28, 2012, decision, the Immigration Judge had granted the DHS’s motion to pretermit the respondent’s application for adjustment of status. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge had granted the DHS’s motion in part because the respondent had not complied with his request to submit documents in support of his adjustment of status application. In his motion to reopen, the respondent contended ineffective assistance of counsel against his prior counsel, Jim Melo, who represented him before the Immigration Judge. He alleged that attorney Melo did not file supporting documents that he had in his possession. However, as the Immigration Judge pointed out in his decision denying reopening, the respondent has not fully complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (I.J. at 2). Although the respondent submitted evidence that his former counsel was contacted regarding the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not indicated whether he has received a response from his former counsel. Also, he has not filed a complaint regarding his former counsel’s performance with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Also, the letter to his former counsel does not mention the reasons he is contending ineffective assistance of counsel. Furthermore, the applicant has not demonstrated a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel sufficient to waive the Lozada requirements. See Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133 (2d Cir. 2007) (persuasive authority) (disbarment of attorney obviates need for compliance with Lozada).
 
*2 In addition, as the Immigration Judge noted in his decision denying reopening, the respondent’s prior attorney indicated in his “Motion to Accept Late Filing of Brief” filed on February 27, 2012, that it was the respondent’s fault that supporting documents had not been submitted by the deadline set by the Court (I.J. at 2).
 
The respondent’s assertion that the Immigration Judge did not communicate the fact that he had pretermitted the respondent’s adjustment of status application until April 9, 2012 is unfounded (Resp. Br. at 6). The evidence shows that the Immigration Judge’s February 2012 decision was served on the respondent’s counsel.
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert West, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christian Parke
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines who was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on January 6, 2012, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated May 11, 2012, denying her motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security is opposed to the respondent’s appeal.
 
The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. As recognized by the respondent on appeal, the motion, which was prepared by her former counsel, lacked merit. Nonetheless, as the respondent has sought new counsel in a diligent manner, filed a complaint against her former counsel, and established that her former counsel’s ineffective assistance of counsel contributed to her failure to appear at her removal hearing, we are satisfied that the respondent has now presented sufficient evidence to establish that the order of removal entered against her should be rescinded. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, we will reopen these proceedings in order to provide the respondent with an additional opportunity to appear for a removal hearing. The following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The in absentia order of removal entered on January 6, 2012, is rescinded, these removal proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gabriel Sayavedra, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
David C. Whipple
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 29, 2013. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(4)(3)(i), (ii).
 
At the outset, to the extent the respondent has challenged the Immigration Judge’s findings as to his removability and eligibility for relief from removal, we consider that the distinct and formal concession of removability, made by the respondent’s attorney acting in his professional capacity and in the respondent’s presence during the removal hearing, is binding on the respondent as a judicial admission (Tr. at 21-24). Applicable regulations, which have the force and effect of law as to the Immigration Judges and this Board, provide in pertinent part that “the immigration judge may determine that removability as charged has been established by the admissions of the respondent.” 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c). The respondent in the instant case has not established that circumstances exist that would permit the withdrawal of his prior judicial admissions. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made as a tactical decision by an attorney in a deportation proceeding is binding on his alien client); Perez-Mejia v. Holder, 641 F.3d 1143 (9th Cir. 2011). Furthermore, the respondent has not filed an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as it relates to counsel’s judicial admissions under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Moreover, even if we were to consider arguendo the respondent’s contentions on appeal challenging his removability, we find his arguments to be unavailing. The record includes undisputed evidence showing that the respondent was convicted of Possession of Drug Paraphernalia, in violation of A.R.S. §§ 13-3401, 13-3408, 13-3415, 13-701, 13-702, 13-702.01, 13-707, 13-801, 13-802 and 13-901.01 (Exhs. 4-6). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has determined that a conviction for the offense of possession of drug paraphernalia is a controlled substance violation. See Luu-Le v. INS, 224 F.3d 911, 916 (9th Cir. 2000) (a conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia under Ariz. Rev. Stat. §13-3415 is a crime relating to a controlled substance under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(I)).
 
*2 The respondent did not express any fear of persecution or torture if returned to Mexico (Tr. at 23), and has failed to establish his eligibility for any relief from removal. See section 240(c)(4)(A)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: COURTNEY BERESFORD LAING
File: AXXX XX8 541 - Detroit, MI
January 3, 2014
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Weronika K. Costas, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On October 21, 2013, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen proceedings in which the Board dismissed his appeal on March 30, 2001. The Board granted his request for a stay of removal on October 25, 2013. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely as it was filed more than 12 years after the Board’s decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). However, he asks that the Board sua sponte reopen proceedings as he contends that he is now eligible for adjustment of status and is the primary caretaker for his elderly and infirm mother. He further argues that the proceedings should be reopened because prior counsel provided him with ineffective assistance (Motion at 9-24).
 
However, we initially note that we do not find the facts that his priority date is now current or that he is his mother’s primary caretaker constitute exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of our discretionary authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “the power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Rather, a priority date’s becoming current following an order of removal is a not unusual circumstance, and becoming potentially eligible for adjustment of status is common and generally not sufficient to warrant a grant of an untimely motion to reopen. Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 105 (BIA 2009). While there is evidence that the respondent’s mother suffers from physical ailments, she is currently employed and there is no evidence that she is wholly dependent on the respondent (Motion, Tab B), or that her situation is such that it constitutes an exceptional situation warranting a sua sponte grant of reopening.
 
To support reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must satisfy the perquisites for such a claim as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). This includes showing that he was prejudiced by counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance, and that he exercised due diligence in pursuing his rights. Mezo v. Holder, 615 F.3d 616, 620 (6th Cir.2010); Tapia-Martinez v. Gonzales, 482 F.3d 417, 423 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting Scorteanu v. INS, 339 F.3d 407, 414 (6th Cir.2003)). We need not address whether the respondent has shown substantial compliance with Matter of Lozada, or otherwise shown ineffective assistance of counsel, including prejudice, as we find that the respondent has not shown due diligence.
 
*2 The final administrative order was issued in this case on March 30, 2001, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit dismissed the respondent’s petition for review on January 29, 2003 (Motion, Tab K). While the respondent’s mother reports she visited Ms. Wong in 2003 and 2007, she reports that Ms. Wong told her “something about [the respondent] having to go back to Jamaica” and ultimately left “believing there was nothing” she could do to help fix her son’s immigration situation (Motion, Tab B, paras. 17-22). There is also no evidence that the respondent thereafter made any effort with regard to his immigration case until he was detained in 2013. Under these circumstances, the respondent has not shown due diligence in pursuing his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and the time limits on filing motions to reopen will therefore not be tolled on that basis. Tapia-Martinez v. Gonzales, supra.
 
While the respondent now claims that he fears he would be harmed if he is returned to Jamaica, he does not state when or how he learned the information underpinning this alleged fear, nor shown that he had these fears at the time of his hearing (Motion at 3, para. 19). Rather, the respondent, although he was then present, did not contest counsel’s report at his hearing that he did not fear persecution or torture (Tr. at 16). Further, his claims in this regard are notably vague and unsupported, and do not establish materially changed country conditions, nor has the respondent filed any application for associated relief with his motion, as required. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
As the respondent has not shown an adequate basis for granting this untimely motion to reopen, either based on ineffective assistance of counsel or sua sponte, the motion will be denied. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nelson L. Peralta, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Laura W. Trosen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines, appeals from the May 21, 2012, decision of the Immigration Judge denying her motion to reopen the proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has submitted a brief in opposition. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether or not the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The proceedings below were continued several times on the basis that the respondent was pursuing a “U” nonimmigrant visa (Tr. at 4-5; 9-11). At the final hearing on January 4, 2012, the respondent accepted voluntary departure until May 3, 2012, and waived appeal (Tr. at 12). Section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a).
 
On May 1, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reopen the proceedings. She attached a U Nonimmigrant Status Certification (Form I-918), which had been signed by a law enforcement officer on April 19, 2012. The certification was based on the activities of the respondent’s aunt as a human trafficker. The DHS opposed reopening, noting that despite the certification, there was little indication that the respondent would be granted a U visa. The DHS also pointed out that the respondent can pursue a U visa even with an order of removal.
 
On May 21, 2012, the Immigration Judge denied the motion as untimely. The Immigration Judge pointed out that although the respondent had raised the issue of trafficking below, she indicated that she was pursuing the U visa on the basis of her son’s murder. She also considered that only the certification had been filed, and that there was no other evidence to support the grant of a U visa. The respondent, with new counsel, has filed this appeal. She asserts that the Immigration Judge did not accurately recall the discussion during the hearing, that she indicated she would reopen if certification was granted, and that the attorney who previously represented her provided ineffective assistance.
 
We find that the Immigration Judge correctly denied the motion to reopen the proceedings as untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). We further do not find any indication that the Immigration Judge misled the respondent into believing that if certification became available, she would reopen the proceedings regardless of the timing (Tr. at 8-9, 15). The Immigration Judge specifically pointed out that if any subsequent motion to reopen was untimely, reopening could be obtained upon agreement of the parties (Id.).
 
*2 The respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in stating that her visa certification was based on a different situation than originally argued (Resp. Br. at 8-10). The record indicates the respondent initially indicated she would pursue the U visa based on her being trafficked by her aunt, but she later indicated that her son’s murder would be the primary basis put forward for the certification (Tr. at 2-4, 7-10). We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s statement here which would warrant reversing her decision, especially due to the untimely nature of the motion to reopen.
 
The respondent also claims that she was subject to ineffective assistance of counsel below. However, her counsel appears to have been actively pursuing the certification and did obtain several continuances for the respondent. Insofar as she accepted voluntary departure on the final hearing date, the record does not establish that this was more than a tactical decision on her part. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382-83 (BIA 1986). Moreover, the respondent has not substantially complied with the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance in removal proceedings. See Matter of Compean, Bangley & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Ortiz-Puentes v. Holder, 662 F.3d 481 (8th Cir. 2011); Habchy v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 858 (8th Cir. 2006); see also Rafiyev v. Mukasey, 536 F.3d 853 (8th Cir. 2008) (rejecting Constitutional right in removal proceedings to effective assistance of counsel under the Fifth Amendment, but finding exercise of Board’s discretion to reopen proper where respondent was ineffectively served by counsel). Most notably, the respondent has not submitted her own statement, proof that she notified prior counsel of her allegations, or that she has filed a disciplinary complaint. See Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
To the extent the respondent cites Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009), and Matter of Garcia, 16 I&N Dec. 653 (BIA 1978), neither of these cases extend their reasoning to untimely motions to reopen (Resp. Br. at 11). We note that in Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807 (BIA 2012), we addressed the circumstances of when proceedings should be continued to await the adjudication of a “U” nonimmigrant visa petition. In that case, we noted the importance of an applicant establishing prima facie eligibility for the visa, including submitting a receipt showing that a petition has been filed with DHS. Sanchez-Sosa at 814. In this case, the respondent has not submitted such proof; rather, she has only provided the signed I-918. This further augments against reopening, even if we set aside the time limitation. The appeal will accordingly be dismissed.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: INES LETICIA NORIEGA
File: AXXX XX0 625 - San Diego, CA
December 16, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Karla Patricia Avelino, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 On September 3, 2013, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On October 3, 2013, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider. We will also treat the motion as a motion to reopen based on the respondent’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. For the following reasons, the motions will be denied.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Guatemala. Prior to the filing of these proceedings, the respondent attempted to enter the United States and was removed pursuant to an expedited order of removal. She re-entered illegally and sought to adjust her status under NACARA. The Department of Homeland Security did not reinstate her removal order, and referred her case to an Immigration Judge for consideration of her NACARA claim. The Department of Homeland Security subsequently filed a Notice to Appear with the Immigration Judge, thereby initiating these proceedings.
 
The DHS then filed a motion to terminate proceedings so that it could reinstate the prior order under section 241(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5). The respondent’s prior counsel and her current counsel both concede that the respondent is not eligible for NACARA (Motion at p. 8 “Upon further review of the record the undersigned concedes that the Respondent was not eligible for NACARA in Immigration Court Proceedings.”; Exh. I at p. 3 (44)). The Immigration Judge terminated proceedings and the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal.
 
The respondent filed the current timely motion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. As to reconsideration, the motion is denied because the respondent has not demonstrated a material error of fact or law in our prior decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). As to reopening, the motion is also denied as the respondent did not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel or prejudice. As the respondent’s former and current counsel both concede, the respondent is not eligible for NACARA. Further, her lack of eligibility is not due to any ineffective actions by her former attorney. The respondent nevertheless requests reopening and a remand because her due process rights have been violated. The respondent argues that she did not agree to termination, and she is entitled to a full and fair hearing.
 
We cannot consider the threshold analysis of whether the respondent’s allegations are inherently unbelievable regarding her allegations of ineffective assistance, see Bhasin v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 977, 987 (9th Cir. 2005), because the respondent did not submit a signed and dated declaration (Exh. A). Further, it is unclear whether the unsigned, undated declaration included as exhibit A is the statement that was submitted to the state bar so the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).1
 
*2 Even if there was ineffective assistance of counsel on the face of the record, the motion would still be denied because the respondent has not demonstrated plausible grounds for relief such that she was prejudiced by the actions of former counsel. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003). As noted supra, the parties concede that the respondent is not eligible for NACARA. And while she generally mentions asylum, she does not allege a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. Nor has she submitted a new asylum application or other evidence evidencing her eligibility for relief from removal.
 
The respondent asserts that her former attorney should have requested an exercise of prosecutorial discretion under the DHS’s John Morton Memorandum on Prosecutorial Discretion. However, she has not attached a copy of the memorandum. Arguably, one of the most favorable ways to exercise prosecutorial discretion is to dismiss a case, which is what occurred here, and the respondent may also file an additional request with DHS. As of the date of the issuance of this decision, the record does not contain evidence that DHS has actually reinstated the prior order of removal. Moreover, this is not a situation where the respondent has demonstrated prima facie eligibility for a form of relief that she may only obtain in removal proceedings. Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The motions are denied.

We note that DHS does not have to terminate current proceedings in order to reinstate a prior order, and could have chosen in the exercise of discretion to continue removal proceedings even though a prior removal order existed. See Villa-Anguiano v. Holder, 727 F.3d 873 (9th Cir. 2013). Former counsel appeared to assert that reinstatement arises by operation of law when, in fact, a number of procedural safeguards and actions are required prior to reinstatement.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sonia R. Lin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brandon L. Lowy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, has filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 25, 2013, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen the removal proceedings in this case to apply for adjustment of status, and alleging ineffective assistance of former counsel.1 While the appeal was pending before the Board, the respondent filed a motion to remand. The appeal will be dismissed. The motion to remand will be denied for lack of jurisdiction.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment in an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record reflects that at a continued master calendar hearing on February 9, 2011, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged in the Notice to Appear (Form I-862) (Exh. 1), based on his admissions, and finding that he had not established his eligibility for any relief or protection from removal, granted the respondent the privilege of pre-conclusion voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), for a period of 120 days, until June 9, 2011.
 
Specifically, the transcript of the February 9, 2011, hearing (Tr. at 14) reflects that the Immigration Judge had continued the proceedings for a period of nearly one year, to allow the respondent’s United States citizen spouse the opportunity to file a new immediate relative immigrant visa petition (Form I-130) on behalf of the respondent, as she had previously withdrawn an earlier visa petition she had filed on his behalf. In a colloquy with the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 13), respondent’s former counsel advised him that she wished to withdraw her representation of the respondent. She indicated to the Immigration Judge that the respondent and his spouse had failed to cooperate with her in providing the documentation necessary to prepare and file a new immediate relative immigrant visa petition on his behalf.
 
*2 In a supplemental brief, and accompanying affidavits, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge denied him the opportunity to contest and dispute the account given by former counsel. We acknowledge that the transcript of the February 9, 2011, hearing reflects that in an ensuing exchange with the Immigration Judge, the respondent was interrupted by him several times (Tr. at 14). However, we note the respondent’s testimony (when read together without the Immigration Judge’s interjections) does not reflect any attempt to contest and dispute the account provided by former counsel, but rather suggests excuses as to why he did not contact her and requests more time to get the necessary documents to file a new Form I-130.2
 
In addition, contrary to respondent’s appellate contention, it was the Immigration Judge and not former counsel, that brought up the issue of voluntary departure (Tr. at 13-14). The record reflects the Immigration Judge asked if former counsel would continue as his legal representative while he qualified the respondent for a grant of voluntary departure before granting her motion to withdraw (Tr. at 15). The Immigration Judge explained to the respondent that this appeared to be the only form of relief from removal then available to him, unless the respondent wanted to accept an order of removal (Tr. at 14-15). In response, the respondent unequivocally stated that he wanted a grant of voluntary departure (Tr. at 15). Contrary to his appellate contention, there is nothing in the record to indicate former counsel influenced the respondent’s decision to pursue voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge clearly explained to the respondent the conditions and penalties associated with the grant of voluntary departure, including that the respondent had to depart the United States no later than June 9, 2011, or the grant of voluntary departure would be withdrawn, and he would not only be subject to an alternate order of removal, but would be precluded from applying for various forms of relief from removal, including adjustment of status, for a period of 10 years (Tr. at 17). The record of the hearing (Tr. at 17-18) reflects the respondent clearly expressed that he understood the Immigration Judge, and accepted the grant of pre-hearing voluntary departure. Contrary to his appellate contentions, as the respondent repeatedly and unambiguously answered “[y]es, sir,” to each of the Immigration Judge’s queries as to whether he understood (Tr. at 17-18), we find no support for any claimed misunderstanding or confusion on the part of the respondent on this point. However, the respondent failed to depart the United States prior to the expiration of the period of voluntary departure. Instead, the respondent filed a motion to reopen on April 5, 2013, more than 2 years after the Immigration Judge’s final order, alleging, inter alia, ineffective assistance by former counsel at the hearing, and seeking to apply for adjustment of status and other forms of relief from removal. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s untimely motion, in a decision dated June 25, 2013.
 
*3 On de novo review, the respondent presents no arguments on appeal to persuade us to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision. Initially, we agree with Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion was untimely filed (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Furthermore, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s contention that he exercised due diligence in pursuing his case so as to possibly pursue equitable tolling of the 90-day motions deadline, when the respondent delayed filing his motion by more than 2 years after the Immigration Judge’s decision. See Chedid v. Holder, 573 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 2009) (if the doctrine of equitable tolling is available, it applies only to those who exercise due diligence). Given the length of the delay at issue, and noting the circumstances that prompted the respondent eventually to consult with an attorney (i.e., he was detained by the DHS pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s outstanding alternate order of removal), the respondent did not exercise due diligence in the pursuit of his rights so as to benefit from the equitable tolling of the statute.3 See Dawoud v. Holder, 561 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir. 2009). Furthermore, we do not find that a truly exceptional situation exists in this case, so as to warrant sua sponte reopening, as also urged by the respondent. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
Notwithstanding, even if timely filed, we find the respondent has not established that the motion should have been granted based on his arguments alleging ineffective assistance of former counsel at his hearing before the Immigration Judge. When a motion to reopen is premised on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien must meet the three specified criteria in order to assist the Board in assessing the validity of the claim. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The second of those criteria is that “before allegations of ineffective assistance of former counsel are presented to the Board, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond.” Id. (emphasis added). While the respondent has provided evidence that he informed his former attorney of the allegations against her in a mailing dated August 29, 2013, this was more than 4 months after the initial motion to reopen was filed with the Immigration Court on April 5, 2013.4 We fail to find that this satisfies Lozada’s requirement that the respondent provide notice that allows his former counsel sufficient time to timely respond to the allegations before filing his motion with the Immigration Judge. See Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2004) ((citing Matter of Lozada, supra at 639 and Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 599 (9th Cir. 2004)). The respondent has failed to comply with this critical Lozada requirement.
 
*4 Moreover, assuming arguendo the respondent had met all the Lozada criteria, the respondent has not demonstrated that reopening of the proceedings is warranted on that basis. In order to advance a successful claim for ineffective assistance of former counsel, an alien must demonstrate prejudice i.e., he “must show that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.” See Saakian v. I.N.S., 252 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2001) (ineffective assistance of counsel exists where, as a result of counsel’s actions (or lack thereof), “the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.”); see also Orehhova v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 48, 52 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing Bernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195 F.3d 56, 63 (1st Cir.1999) (the alien must show at least a reasonable probability of prejudice)); Toban v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 40, 46 (1st Cir. 2004) (alien alleging denial of due process must show prejudice in all but the most “extreme case[s]”); LeBlanc v. INS, supra at 694 (no need to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel where “[t]here has been no violation of fundamental fairness”).
 
Contrary to the respondent’s appellate contentions, the record of the February 9, 2011, hearing (Tr. at 13), reveals that respondent’s former counsel moved to withdraw as his legal representative arguing before the Immigration Judge that she had been unable to prepare and file the Form I-130 on behalf of the respondent, as had been previously directed by the Immigration Judge at the February 3, 2010, hearing (Tr. at 11), because the respondent and his spouse had not cooperated with her repeated requests to provide necessary documentation in support of that visa petition. See, e.g., 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(b) (A visa petition must be accompanied by all required documents).
 
Further, notwithstanding his appellate contentions as to the interruptions by the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 14) of his testimony that followed, there is no indication that he was disputing the account provided by his former counsel, as opposed to offering excuses and seeking more time to obtain the necessary documentation to file the visa petition (Tr. at 14). The respondent has presented no evidence in support of any alleged attempts to contact former counsel (e.g., correspondence, telephone records, etc.) from the time of the February 3, 2010, hearing, until the February 9, 2011, hearing date. Whereas the affidavits that accompanied the respondent’s supplemental brief allege that the respondent and his spouse were repeatedly unable to contact former counsel by phone, there is no indication as to how many calls were made to former counsel, what are the dates and times of these calls, and what efforts they made to follow up on those unsuccessful attempts to reach her. Specifically, the respondent has not provided copies of any letters that were sent to former counsel inquiring about the case. As such, respondent’s former counsel cannot be faulted for not having had the Form I-130 filed or ready to be filed by the February 9, 2011, hearing, where that failure appears to be due in large part to the respondent’s own failure to provide her with the necessary documentation for filing the Form I-130 before the hearing. See Punzalan v. Holder, 575 F.3d 107, 110 (1st Cir. 2009). Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated that he had any plausible basis for any other form of relief in this case, other than the pre-hearing voluntary departure granted by the Immigration Judge. We conclude, therefore, that the respondent has failed to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel at the hearing under the particular circumstances presented in this case.5 See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*5 In accordance with the foregoing, we find that the respondent has failed to demonstrate that a motion to reopen removal proceedings is warranted under the circumstances, or that the Immigration Judge erred in denying it.6
 
Finally, with respect to the respondent’s motion to remand, the motion will be denied as it is not properly before us for consideration. The Board has jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen his removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(b)(3). However, the Board generally does not have the authority to reopen a case that has never been properly before us in the first instance. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974). One of the conditions associated with the grant of pre-hearing voluntary departure is the respondent waive appeal of all issues in the Immigration Judge’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i). As the record reflects that the respondent accepted the Immigration Judge’s grant of pre-hearing voluntary departure (Tr. at 17-18), and there is no indication that an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 9, 2011, decision, was ever filed with the Board, it became the final administrative order entered in this case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39. Thus, the Board never acquired initial jurisdiction over this case, and the filing of an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s denial of a motion to reopen, does not give the Board jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s motion to remand. Admittedly, the regulations allow for the consolidation and consideration of motions to reopen submitted while there is a pending appeal before Board. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4). However, this does not extend the Board’s jurisdiction to consider motions to reopen when it has never taken initial jurisdiction over proceedings. As the Immigration Judge’s February 9, 2011, decision, was the final administrative order entered in this case, the motion should have been addressed to the Immigration Court.
 
Therefore, as the respondent’s motion is not properly before us for consideration, it will be denied. Moreover, in view of our decision, the respondent’s request for a stay of removal will be denied. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied.

The record reflects that the respondent was initially represented by Zoila Gomez, Esquire, at the hearing before the Immigration Judge. Subsequently, the respondent was represented by John Garzon, Esquire, who filed a motion to reopen on behalf of the respondent, and initially represented him on appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of that motion. The respondent is presently represented by Sonia R. Lin, Esquire, who filed an appellate brief in support of the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen, as well as a motion to remand alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The ineffective assistance of former counsel claim primarily concerns the respondent’s legal representation by attorney Zoila Gomez at the hearings before the Immigration Judge, and derivatively from the actions of attorney John Garzon in the filing of the motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge.

Specifically, we find the hearing transcript as to that exchange (Tr. at 14) provides a clearer indication as to the actual intent of the respondent, wherein he states that “. . . what I’m saying is can you give me a chance, because I have to put in and make the application because I was . . .” At which point the Immigration Judge declined any further continuances noting that he had already postponed the case for one year, and the respondent did not do what he was told to do. The respondent appears to acknowledge that he did not comply with the Immigration Judge’s directive as to the filing of the Form I-130, and says, “Yeah, I was trying to make the documents. However . . . I didn’t have . . .” At this juncture, the Immigration Judge notes that if the respondent was unable to do it in one year, there was no reason to believe that he would ever be able to do it. At which point the respondent apologizes and states, “[y]eah, sorry.”

We observe, moreover, as to the request for equitable tolling of the timely filing requirement of the regulations, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has indicated that it has “not yet decided whether equitable tolling applies to the statute’s ninety-day deadline, despite multiple opportunities to do so.” See Bolieiro v. Holder, 731 F.3d 32, 39 (1st Cir. 2013) (citing Romer v. Holder, 663 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir. 2011) and Da Silva Neves v. Holder, 568 F.3d 41, 42 (1st Cir. 2009)). And even if it were available, “equitable tolling is a ‘sparingly’ invoked doctrine.” Jobe v. INS, 238 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2001) (en banc) (setting forth five-factor test used to determine entitlement to equitable tolling).

4

Moreover, this deficiency is not cured by the fact that a copy of the letter was later included with the respondent’s appellate brief and motion to remand, which is dated August 30, 2013, and only one day before the date of the letter sent to his former counsel.

5

In addition, even assuming arguendo the respondent has demonstrated that prior counsel who filed the motion to reopen in this case was ineffective in his representation due to defects in the motion he had filed, the respondent has not shown that he suffered prejudice as a result of that ineffective representation so that it affected the outcome of his case, i.e., the claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel at the hearing did not establish that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing, and moreover, the motion to reopen was untimely filed and not fitting within any exceptions. See also Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 105 (BIA 2009) (untimely motions to reopen to apply for adjustment of status generally do not fall within any of the statutory or regulatory exceptions for motions to reopen and are generally denied).

6

Furthermore, the respondent’s failure to depart from the United States within the time period allowed for voluntary departure under the Immigration Judge’s final order rendered him statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status for a period of 10 years from that failure to depart. See section 240B(d)(1)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d)(1)(B); see also Jupiter v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 487, 491 (1st Cir. 2005) (holding that the plain language of INA § 240B(d) renders an alien ineligible for adjustment of status where the alien has previously failed to adhere to a voluntary departure order).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard W. Chang, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Adam L. Berg
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration; adjustment of status
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of India, appeals the December 23, 2011,1 denial of a motion to reopen and reconsider seeking adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). The Immigration Judge held that the respondent did not demonstrate prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review issues of law, discretion, or judgment de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent asserts that he was admitted to the United States on May 11, 2000, and he retained Earl S. David, Esquire, on April 5, 2001, to file an application for labor certification on his behalf before the April 30, 2001, “““grandfathering” deadline. See section 245(i)(1)(B)(i) of the Act. The record shows that the labor certification application was filed on July 13, 2001. On April 22, 2009, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status because he could not demonstrate that a labor certification had been filed on his behalf on or before April 30, 2001. See id. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s renewed application for adjustment of status on September 29, 2011, and ordered his removal. The respondent filed no appeal with the Board. In the motion at issue, the respondent argued that the filing deadline of section 245(i)(1)(B)(i) of the Act should be equitably tolled due to the ineffective assistance of Mr. David.
 
The respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). An applicant for reopening must further demonstrate prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988).
 
As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent has identified no legal authority supporting equitable tolling of the deadline of section 245(i)(1)(B)(i) of the Act. The respondent relies upon Piranej v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 137 (2d Cir. 2008), which is not binding in this case arising within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. See Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25, 31 (BIA 1989) (explaining that the Board historically follows a court’s precedent in cases arising in that circuit). In any event, in remanding for fact-finding and a determination of whether Piranej had complied with Matter of Lozada, the court declined to address whether ineffective assistance of counsel could serve as a basis for equitable tolling of the April 30, 2001, grandfathering deadline under section 245(i) of the Act. Piranej, supra, at 145. Another court has answered this question in the negative by affirming the Board’s holding that the deadline under section 245(i) operates as a statute of repose, and thus is not subject to equitable tolling. Balam-Chuc v. Mukasey, 547 F.3d 1044, 1048-50 (9th Cir. 2008). Similarly, the Fourth Circuit has held that the principles of equitable tolling do not apply to statutes such as section 245(i)(1)(B)(i) of the Act “where strict satisfaction of a time limit may be required as a precondition to jurisdiction over a matter.” Harris v. Hutchinson, 209 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir. 2000). Therefore, as the respondent has not shown prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(i), we affirm the denial of his motion to reopen and reconsider.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Teodora Arias, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Colombia. The Board’s final administrative decision was issued on February 23, 2011, when the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act. The respondent’s motion to reopen was received on October 10, 2013. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). As the record reflects that the Board did not receive the motion to reopen until October 10, 2013, the motion was filed out of time. The respondent has not alleged or shown that she is subject to any of the exceptions to the time limitation on motions to reopen under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). As the respondent refers to misrepresentations by former counsel, we will consider whether equitable tolling of the time limit on motions to reopen due to ineffective assistance is warranted.
 
The respondent was represented by counsel before the Immigration Judge, but was considered pro se on appeal. The respondent contends that she was misrepresented in criminal proceedings and that she received ineffective assistance from her former attorney before the Immigration Judge. However, with respect to immigration proceedings, there is no indication that the respondent has filed any complaints against her former attorney or that she provided her with notice of the ineffective assistance claim so that she had an adequate opportunity to respond thereto. We find that the respondent has not met the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Jian Yun Zheng v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005); Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108, 110-111 (2d Cir. 1993). We also note that as the respondent has not provided any detailed explanation for her delay in filing the motion for any misrepresentation before the Immigration Judge, we find that the respondent has not shown that she exercised due diligence in seeking reopening based on the claimed ineffective assistance. Consequently, equitable tolling is not warranted. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir.2006) (“[N]o matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled.”); Iavorski v. United States INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000). We also find no basis for granting reopening sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reopen and the request for a stay of removal will be denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
James A. Stanton, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Heith M. Kaneshige
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Termination; adjustment of status
 
The respondents, natives and citizens of Switzerland, appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 13, 2012, finding the respondents removable as charged and denying their applications for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the determination of credibility. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). Contrary to the respondent’s argument on appeal, the Immigration Judge did not err when she found the respondents removable under section 237(a)(1)(B) as their E-2 visas expired in 1995. The respondents concede that their visas expired in 1995 (Br. at 15). The respondents appear to argue that they are not removable because their former counsel failed to file an extension for their visas. The respondents have not, however, complied with any of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). The respondents are removable as charged.
 
Assuming that the Immigration Judge had jurisdiction in this case to consider the respondent’s applications for adjustment of status, we affirm her conclusion that the respondents are not eligible as the applications they submitted are incomplete. In addition, we affirm for the reasons stated in the Immigration Judge’s decision that the respondents do not merit adjustment of status in discretion if they were eligible (I.J. at 5). As noted by the Immigration Judge, the misrepresentation made by the respondents during the bankruptcy proceedings is a strong negative factor, and the respondents have not presented sufficient positive equities that would outweigh this factor. Finally, we reject the respondent’s contention that they are not removable because they have an approved EB-5 visa. The respondents’ applications for adjustment of status on the basis of this visa were denied on February 9, 2009 (Exh. 4). The respondents were informed at that time that they were in violation of their nonimmigrant status. Accordingly, the respondents’ appeal will be dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
George C. Maroun, Jr., Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; stay of removal
 
*1 The respondent is a native of Brazil and a citizen of Italy. He has timely appealed from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 24, 2013, denying his motion to reopen. He has also filed an emergency motion to stay removal. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal and deny the motion.
 
The respondent’s removal proceedings concluded when, on May 30, 2013, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent the privilege of voluntarily departing the United States on or before July 15, 2013. See section 240B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c. On July 17, 2013, the respondent filed a motion seeking to reopen his removal proceedings alleging that he did not knowingly and voluntarily request voluntary departure at his master calendar hearing or sign the written pleading submitted to the court. The motion asked that the proceedings be reopened, that the respondent be granted reasonable bond, and that “any further relief that may be just and reasonable” be granted as well.
 
In a decision dated July 24, 2013, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen after concluding that the respondent had neither shown prima facie eligibility for any relief from removal nor included with his motion any applications for relief. The Immigration Judge also noted that, even though the respondent was alleging that his prior counsel failed to properly advise him regarding voluntary departure and that he had not knowingly sought such relief, the court had explained to him the nature and consequences of voluntary departure and confirmed that he wished to apply for it. The Immigration Judge further pointed out that, even if the facts were as alleged by the respondent, the respondent had not complied with the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), nor established that he had been prejudiced by his prior counsel’s decision to seek voluntary departure (I.J. at 3).
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge summarily denied his motion because of his failure to indicate whether he might be eligible for any relief and argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not considering his affidavit accompanying the motion. See Respondent’s Notice of Appeal at 2, item no. 6.1
 
A respondent seeking reopening of his or her proceedings bears a “heavy burden” to establish new facts that will be proven at a hearing and the motion must be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material. See section 240(c)(7)(B) of the Act; see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). The motion must also be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief. Unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied that the evidence is material, was not available, and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing, a motion to reopen will not be granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). The respondent must proffer evidence to demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits. Matter of A-N- & R-M-N-, 22 I&N Dec. 953, 956 (BIA 1999). However, the Immigration Judge retains the discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the moving party has established a prima facie case for relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3).
 
*2 We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. We agree that the respondent, who has yet to submit an application for relief from removal or identify the form of relief he would seek if his motion were granted, has not established prima facie eligibility for any form of relief from removal (I.J. at 3). We also agree that the respondent has not shown compliance with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, nor proved prejudice. See Zeru v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 59, 72 (1st Cir. 2007) (stating that “to succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, [aliens] must show ‘a reasonable probability of prejudice’ resulting from their former representation”). We are not persuaded by the respondent’s appellate argument that the Immigration Judge erred in not considering his affidavit accompanying the motion. The fact that the decision did not explicitly refer to the respondent’s affidavit does not necessarily mean that the Immigration Judge disregarded it. Moreover, the affidavit only contained general assertions regarding the respondent’s desire to be allowed to remain in the United States and his belief that he received ineffective assistance from his prior counsel. It remained silent as to the issue of what form of relief from removal the respondent might be interested in if his proceedings were reopened.
 
We further find, after examining the totality of the respondent’s general allegations of deficiencies in his underlying removal proceedings, that the respondent has not demonstrated that sua sponte reopening is warranted. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999). As such, we decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. Additionally, inasmuch as the respondent has not demonstrated that reopening is warranted, his request for a stay of removal pending adjudication of his motion is moot. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 107-110 (BIA 2009). Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion is denied as moot.

IN RE: MEIBE VILLUMSEN

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
Lodged: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)] - Crime involving moral turpitude
 
 
APPLICATION: Termination
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, appeals the Immigration Judge’s July 20, 2012, decision finding that the respondent is removable under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). We review the Immigration Judge’s factual findings for clear error and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by finding that the respondent illegally entered the United States. According to the respondent, the road on which she was traveling when she was stopped by a border patrol agent is entirely within Canada. See Respondent’s Brief at 1. The respondent did not raise this argument before the Immigration Judge, however. In fact, the respondent’s attorney argued that the respondent entered the United States at a Vermont port of entry (Tr. at 48-50). Further, the border patrol agent who stopped the respondent testified at the April 27, 2012, hearing (Tr. at 90). Agent Lahan testified that he stopped the respondent on February 7, 2009, when he was patrolling the border between Canada and Vermont (I.J. at 4; Tr. at 91-92). He said that he stopped the respondent’s car approximately 50-100 yards south of the border on a street that does not have a port of entry (I.J. at 4, 5; Tr. at 92-93).
 
The respondent also argues on appeal that Agent Lahan’s memory was poor and that he testified incorrectly about the direction of the road on which the respondent was traveling. See Respondent’s Brief at 4, 5. The respondent did not raise these factual issues before the Immigration Judge, however. See Matter of Jimenez-Santillano, 21 I&N Dec. 567, 570 n.2 (BIA 1996); Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191, 196 n.4 (BIA 1990). Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984) (the Board “is an appellate body whose function is to review, not to create, a record” and it is not appropriate to accept evidence proffered for the first time on appeal). Instead, before the Immigration Judge, the respondent’s attorney argued that the point of entry through which the respondent traveled was undefined and that the respondent lacked intent to enter at a place that was not a designated port of entry (I.J. at 8, 9; Tr. at 117-18).
 
*2 Further, to the extent that the respondent argues that her attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel, we note that the respondent has not satisfied the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639, 640 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (respondent must (1) present an affidavit explaining in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) inform the attorney of the allegations leveled against him and give him an opportunity to respond; and (3) explain whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not, and (4) demonstrate prejudice as a result of the alleged error). See Respondent’s Brief at 7-8.
 
For these reasons, we uphold the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent is removable under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Erin Mount, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)] - Conditional resident status terminated
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Vietnam, appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 11, 2012, decision. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s second untimely motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order that was entered on January 23, 2007. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 723 (BIA 1999). Aliens raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a motion may have the time limits on motions equitably tolled. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). However, an alien raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must establish that he has been diligent in raising the claim and must establish that he was prejudiced by his prior attorney’s alleged failures. See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1184-85 (9th Cir. 2001) (requiring exercise of reasonable diligence in pursuing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim);
 
The respondent’s first motion to reopen, based on the ineffective assistance of counsel, was filed January 27, 2009. The motion was filed by her second attorney, Nguyen Hong Nhuan, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel by her first attorney, Neil V.X. Nguyen. The Immigration Judge denied the motion because the respondent (1) did not comply with the requirements of Matter of Compean, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009),1 and (2) provided no explanation for her 1 ½-year delay in filing the motion. See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, supra. See February 25, 2009, I.J. at 2-3. The Immigration Judge’s decision was not appealed and is now final. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39.
 
*2 On February 3, 2012, the respondent filed a second untimely motion to reopen based on the ineffective assistance of Nguyen Hong Nhuan. The respondent claims that Nguyen Hong Nhuan provided her with ineffective assistance of counsel because he failed to file a complaint with the State bar against Neil V. X. Nguyen and that he did not file a motion to reopen in her case until July 2009, approximately 8 months after he was retained by the respondent. She stated that she did not discover that her motion to reopen had been denied until approximately September or October 2009.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate due diligence in filing her second motion to reopen. In the decision on appeal, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen because she did not exercise due diligence between the discovery of the denial of her first motion to reopen, October 2009, and the filing of her second motion to reopen, February 3, 2012 (April 11, 2012, I.J. at 4-5).2 Before the Immigration Judge and on appeal, the respondent argued that she exercised due diligence and that her motion to reopen occurred within a reasonable time because she required that amount of time to obtain evidence in support of her motion (April 11, 2012, I.J. at 4-5; Respondent’s Br. at 4-5). See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 677 (9th Cir. 2011) (due diligence is determined by assessing when a reasonable person in the alien’s position would suspect fraud or error, what steps, if any, the alien took to investigate, and at what point the alien learns of the harm). As stated by the Immigration Judge, the respondent did not demonstrate why it took over 2 years to gather the evidence, which should have been in her possession, relevant to her ineffective assistance of counsel claim and file state bar complaints (April 11, 2012, I.J. at 4-5). On appeal, the respondent does not provide any further information or explanation regarding her lack of diligence.
 
The respondent does not appeal the Immigration Judge’s denial to reopen these proceedings sua sponte pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), and we decline to disturb his decision. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1134 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances). Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening and remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ghana, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s April 2, 2012, decision denying his motion for a continuance and ordering him removed from the United States. The Department of Homeland Security has filed a brief in response to the respondent’s appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent states that he does not challenge the Immigration Judge’s decision denying a continuance and ordering him removed from the United States. Rather, he is requesting that the Board reopen the proceedings and remand the record to the Immigration Judge because he received ineffective assistance from his prior attorney. While he has not formally filed a motion to reopen, he is requesting the reopening of his case. A request for reopening and remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in the Board’s decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d sub nom. Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Matter of Lozada, supra, we held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must (1) be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) provide evidence that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned has been informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and (3) indicate whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. In addition to these requirements, an alien alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must show that he or she was prejudiced by the actions or inactions of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
In the instant case, the respondent has not complied with any of the above-mentioned requirements. He has not even provided an affidavit outlining the agreement he had with his prior counsel or what representations his former attorney made to him. Nor has he shown that he has notified former counsel of the allegations against him or indicated whether he has filed a complaint with appropriate disciplinary authorities. Moreover, he has not alleged how the proceeding below was so fundamentally unfair that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case. As such, we do not find that the respondent has met his burden of proof to warrant reopening and remanding the proceedings to the Immigration Court.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order is entered.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David W. Williams, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ted Y. Yamada
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s July 18, 2012, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.
 
The respondent failed to timely file applications for relief by May 2, 2012, the deadline set by the Immigration Judge on October 19, 2011. In a decision dated May 9, 2012, the Immigration Judge deemed the applications abandoned and granted voluntary departure to the respondent. On June 8, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, which included a sworn statement from the respondent’s counsel, David Williams. In that statement, Mr. Williams averred that his employer retired from practice in February 2012, resulting in Mr. Williams taking over the employer’s caseload. Mr. Williams then admitted that due to administrative changes, he failed to properly calendar the May 2, 2012, filing deadline. By order dated July 18, 2012, the Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding that the respondent had failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case lies, has held that strict compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, is not required when the ineffectiveness of counsel was plain on its face. Tamang v. Holder, 598 F.3d 1083, 1090 (9th Cir. 2010); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (ineffectiveness was plain on its face where petitioner’s former counsel misrepresented to petitioner that his application had been filed and petitioner later filed a declaration complying with Lozada); Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 938 (9th Cir. 2003) (ineffectiveness was plain on its face where former counsel mis-calendared the removal hearing, petitioner failed to appear at the hearing, and declarations were filed that complied with the first two prongs of Lozada); Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 824-25 (9th Cir. 2003) (ineffectiveness was plain on its face where former counsel forgot to file the brief because he was transitioning to a new job and taking over a former colleague’s caseload, and declarations were filed satisfying the first prong of Lozada).
 
*2 Here, Mr. Williams has admitted that the failure to timely file the applications was due to his error, not the respondent’s. Consequently, we find that ineffectiveness of counsel is plain on the face of the record. See Lin v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that the court “““must consider the underlying merits of the case to come to a tentative conclusion as to whether [a petitioner’s] claim, if properly presented, would be viable,” notwithstanding the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s decisions of July 18, 2012, and May 9, 2012, are vacated and the proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Zachary Nightingale, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James B. Gildea
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings; remand
 
*1 The respondent has appealed an Immigration Judge’s decision of August 7, 2012, finding that the respondent had abandoned his lawful permanent resident (“LPR”) status. While the appeal was pending, the respondent filed a motion to remand, which the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has opposed. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Where, as here, the respondent has a colorable claim of LPR status, the burden is on the DHS to demonstrate by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the respondent abandoned that status. Khoshfahm v. Holder, 655 F.3d 1147 (9th Cir. 2011). In order to qualify as a returning resident, an alien “must be returning to an unrelinquished lawful permanent residence after a temporary visit abroad.” See Singh v. Reno, 113 F.3d 1512, 1514 (9th Cir. 1997). A trip is a “temporary visit abroad” if (a) it is for a “relatively short” period, fixed by some early event; or (b) the trip will terminate upon the occurrence of an event that has a reasonable possibility of occurring within a relatively short period of time. See Chavez-Ramirez v. INS, 792 F.2d 932, 937 (9th Cir. 1986). If the alien’s trip abroad is not “relatively short,” it is a “temporary visit abroad” only if the alien has “a continuous, uninterrupted intention to return to the United States during the entirety of her visit.” See Khodagholian v. Ashcroft, 335 F.3d 1003 (9th Cir. 2003). Factors to be considered in evaluating the respondent’s intent to return to the United States include: “the alien’s family ties, property holdings, and business affiliations within the United States, and the alien’s family, property, and business ties in the foreign country.” Singh v. Reno, supra, at 1514-15.
 
The respondent was granted LPR status in 2004 and was placed in removal proceedings in April 2010. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had abandoned his status, citing to the fact that between 2004 and 2010, the respondent spent a minimal number of days in the United States, and he got married, had children, and started his own business in China.
 
*2 The Immigration Judge specifically noted the dearth of documentary evidence of the respondent’s ties to the United States (I.J. at 10), the lack of affidavits from family or friends (I.J. at 12-13), the lack of proof that, he maintained any rental units or had any property ownership in the United States (I.J. at 10, 12).
 
With his motion, the respondent has submitted evidence of his United States business ties (Motion, Exhs. B1-C6), affidavits from his United States citizen family members (Motion, Exh. A, 2-4), documentation of the bank account he maintained in the United States (Exh. A12), as well as evidence he says indicates that, during the years in question, he paid rent to maintain a residence here (Motion, Exh. A2) and owned, registered, and paid taxes on the car which he kept in the United States (Motion, Exh. A, 5-8). The respondent has also submitted medical evidence regarding his father’s illness and death which he said caused him to remain in China in 2005, as well as evidence of his own medical problem that he said delayed his return in 2010 (Motion, Exhs. D and E).
 
Although the evidence proffered by the respondent was previously available, he asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his former attorney for failing to advise the respondent to produce such evidence (Motion, at 14-20). He also claims that his attorney failed to advise him of the consequences of a removal order, namely the 10-year bar from returning to the United States, and did not give him the option of withdrawing or renouncing his LPR status (Motion, at 23; Tr. at 100-08).
 
The respondent has complied with the requirements set forth in in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for ineffective assistance of counsel claims (Motion, Exh. H, 2-5). We will remand for the Immigration Judge to evaluate the ineffective assistance claim and to determine whether the respondent has established the requisite prejudice. See Dent v. Holder, 627 F.3d 365, 373 (9th Cir. 2010) (prejudice “means that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged violation”).1 Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

November 4, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Margaret Wong, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated April 20, 2012, denying her motion to reopen the proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against her on February 22, 2012. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including any determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge properly ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States based upon her prior admission to the factual allegations contained in the Notice to Appear and concession of removability and her failure to appear for the hearing. Section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The respondent timely filed a motion to reopen in which she alleged “exceptional circumstances” for her failure to appear and alternatively requested sua sponte reopening of the proceedings. See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and 240(e)(1) of the Act; Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion, and this appeal followed.
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s April 20, 2012, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings and rescind the removal order against her. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). Section 240(e)(1) of the Act states that the “term ‘exceptional circumstances’ refers to exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” The respondent had been on notice of the hearing date for more than 4 months (I.J. at 3; Exh. 7). Neither her attorney’s representation that he would seek administrative closure or a continuance of the proceedings, nor the fact that the Immigration Judge could not adjudicate the respondent’s adjustment application because the visa petition was still pending, excused the respondent’s absence at the hearing based on her assumption that the hearing would be rescheduled. See Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996) (the filing of a motion for a continuance does not excuse an alien from failing to appear). The respondent has indicated that she is not making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (Respondent’s brief at 10). The Immigration Judge correctly noted that the respondent had not complied with the requirements for such a claim and that any claimed ineffectiveness of the prior attorney is not plain on the face of the record where the respondent was notified of the hearing date.
 
*2 The respondent received proper notice of the hearing and did not establish exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear. Additionally, sua sponte authority for reopening proceedings is invoked sparingly and only for truly exceptional situations. The respondent has not demonstrated that the application of such an extraordinary remedy is warranted in this case. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the proceedings and rescind the removal order. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: ZHE LIU A.K.A. LIU ZHE
File: AXXX XX7 062 - Saipan, MP
October 31, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mun Su Park, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Chandu Latey
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening; stay of removal
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on July 24, 2013, when we issued an order upholding an Immigration Judge’s removal order and denied a motion to remand this case for further proceedings. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reconsider that decision. She also seeks reopening of the removal proceedings and a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief in opposition to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent seeks reconsideration and/or reopening of these proceedings due to the alleged ineffective assistance of her former attorney, Stephen Woodruff, who represented her before the Immigration Judge. The respondent contends that Woodruff erred in failing to advise her of her apparent eligibility for pre-conclusion or post-conclusion voluntary departure.
 
To the extent that the respondent seeks reconsideration, she has failed to identify any error of fact or law in our prior decision that would warrant its reconsideration. See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). The respondent’s newly raised argument concerning Woodruffs’ alleged ineffective assistance can and should have been raised previously and, as such, is not a proper basis for reconsideration of our prior decision. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 58 (stating that “[a] motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied,” and that “[a]rguments for consideration on appeal should all be submitted at one time, rather than in piecemeal fashion.” (citation omitted)).
 
We also decline to reopen these proceedings. As a preliminary matter, the instant motion is unaccompanied by any new, material evidence that would establish the respondent’s prima facie eligibility for the relief that she seeks. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992).
 
Further, the respondent’s motion does not comply with any of the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for raising an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, and there is no clear and obvious ineffective assistance on this record with respect to the issue of voluntary departure. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (substantial fulfillment of the procedural requirements of Lozada, supra, is generally necessary to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel unless the record reflects a clear and obvious case of such). We also discern no prejudice where, as here, the respondent has not shown that Woodruff’s alleged failure to inform her of apparent eligibility for pre-conclusion or post-conclusion voluntary departure may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004) (a claim of ineffective representation must show that the allegedly deficient performance of former counsel may have affected the outcome in the case). The respondent has not meaningfully shown that she is even eligible for voluntary departure or that she would, in fact, have sought voluntary departure if Woodruff had advised her of the availability of such relief.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion for reconsideration is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: ZHU XIA LI
File: AXXX XX7 741 - Los Angeles, CA
October 18, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Keith R. Ayers, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of China, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s June 18, 2013, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings, in which the respondent was ordered removed in absentia under section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). The respondent has also submitted evidence, which we will construe as a motion to remand the proceedings to the Immigration Judge. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion denied.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the Immigration Judge’s determination of credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision that the respondent did not establish exceptional circumstances for not appearing at her hearing. The respondent claims, inter alia, that she suffered ineffective assistance of counsel, where a prior attorney - Walter Burrier, Esquire - allegedly advised her that appearing at the hearing “was not worth it” and she would be returned to China immediately if she appeared without counsel. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, dated May 23, 2013, tab 1 at 6. But the Immigration Judge provided the respondent with oral and written notice of the date, time, and location of her removal August 4, 2005, hearing, as well as the consequences for failing to appear (I.J. at 4). See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, dated May 23, 2013, tab 1 at 6. Thus, the respondent knew that failing to appear at her hearing could result in the Immigration Judge issuing an in absentia removal order. The respondent received proper notice of her removal hearing and was on notice of the consequences of not appearing. Her alleged fear of being immediately removed to China does not establish exceptional circumstances for failing to appear.
 
Nor are we persuaded that the respondent has established ineffective assistance of prior counsel. As the Immigration Judge found, the respondent did not sufficiently comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) in order to raise ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The respondent has not submitted sufficient evidence that she - or her current counsel - informed counsel-Burrier or counsel-Cindy Chang of their alleged deficient performance, and she did not file disciplinary complaints against either attorney. Although the respondent’s counsel has submitted a vague affidavit indicating that he has communicated with counsel-Burrier and counsel-Chang, he has not identified the circumstances of the alleged discussions or when they occurred. See Respondent’s Appeal Brief, tab 4. Counsel’s vague affidavit is insufficient to meet the Lozada requirements. And given the nature of the respondent’s allegations against counsel-Burrier, compliance with Lozada is particularly important here, as counsel should have the opportunity to address the respondent’s assertion that he essentially advised her to ignore an Immigration Court order to attend her hearing.
 
*2 We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not diligently raise ineffective assistance, where she waited over 7 years to present the claims against her prior attorneys. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent has not adequately shown that she was unaware of the in absentia removal order at the time it was issued. Nor has she demonstrated that she maintained regular communication with prior counsel in order to stay abreast of the status of the case. Further, given that the Immigration Judge advised the respondent of the consequences of not appearing at her hearing, she should have been aware that the Immigration Judge would issue an in absentia removal order when she did not attend her August 2005 hearing. Thus, the respondent has not shown the requisite due diligence to support her ineffective assistance of counsel claims.
 
In conjunction with the appeal, the respondent has submitted evidence, which we will treat as a motion to remand. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4). The motion will be denied, as the only evidence attached to the respondent’s appeal brief that does not predate the respondent’s May 2013 motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, consists of purported Internet-based searches of the current status of her former attorneys, and current counsel’s affidavit discussed above. The respondent has not established that this evidence was not reasonably available and could not have been presented with her motion; therefore, it does not comply with the regulatory requirements for a motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Alternatively, even if we considered the documents, they would not alter our conclusion that the respondent has not met her burden of demonstrating an exceptional circumstance for not appearing at her hearing below.
 
ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: DENEISE BENJAMIN-STUBBS
File: AXXX XX5 916 - Miami, FL
October 17, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Merrick J. Dammar, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 30, 2012. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under a clearly erroneous standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
As reflected in the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent was ordered removed in absentia on August 5, 1998, when she failed to appear for a master calendar hearing. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent received notice of the August 5, 1998, hearing because it was personally served on the respondent’s attorney of record, Chandler R. Finley, Esquire, on June 10, 1998, who in turn mailed such notice to the respondent’s last known address. On appeal, the respondent argues that there was no constructive service because the Immigration Judge granted Mr. Findley’s motion to withdraw as counsel prior to the August 5, 1998, hearing. The respondent separately argues that her failure to appear should be excused due to ineffective assistance of counsel because a representative at a free legal clinic advised her not to go to Immigration Court as he planned to obtain a continuance or adjournment of the proceedings.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly found that the respondent had proper notice of the August 5, 1998, hearing. Although Mr. Findley’s motion to withdraw as counsel was based in part on the representation that he was never requested or retained by the respondent to represent her in these proceedings, we take administrative notice that the record shows that Mr. Findley had filed a Notice of Entry of Appear (Form EOIR-28) with the Immigration Court, and therefore was counsel of record when served with notice of the August 5, 1998, hearing. Therefore, we agree that the respondent received constructive notice of the August 5, 1998, hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2). Moreover, the respondent has indicated that she received actual notice, inasmuch as she admits that she was aware of and discussed whether to attend the hearing with a free legal clinic representative.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly found that the respondent cannot seek rescission of the in absentia order based on ineffective assistance of counsel as an exceptional circumstance because her motion to reopen was filed more than 180 days after the in absentia order of removal was entered. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). It is also undisputed that she has not complied with the procedural requirements outlined in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for filing a claim of effective assistance. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996). Moreover, even assuming that the respondent’s failure to attend the August 5, 1998, hearing was due to erroneous legal advice, we find that she failed to act with due diligence in this matter, such that equitable tolling of the 180 day filing deadline should be considered. See generally Avila-Santoyo v. United States Atty. Gen., 713 F.3d 1357, 1358 (11th 2013) (equitable tolling generally requires litigant to show (1) that she has been pursuing her rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in her way).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Juan Carlos Penaflor, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Eric Bales
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated June 13, 2013, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent’s appeal, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), will be dismissed.1
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
On August 17, 2006, the Immigration Court mailed the respondent’s former attorney a Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings which informed the respondent that a removal hearing had been scheduled in this matter on October 3, 2006 (I.J. at 2; Exh. 2). As the respondent did not appear at his removal hearing, he was ordered removed from the United States to El Salvador in absentia (I.J. at 2). See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The respondent filed his motion to reopen with the Immigration Court on March 6, 2013 (I.J. at 2).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely under the general rule requiring aliens to file a motion to reopen within 90 days of the entry of a final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
The respondent has not demonstrated that these removal proceedings should be reopened on account of lack of notice (I.J. at 2-3). See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Here, the Immigration Court fulfilled its duty of notifying the respondent of the place, time, and date of his hearing by mailing the aforementioned Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings to the respondent’s former counsel. Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985). While the respondent argues that his former counsel did not represent him after he was released from detention, the record is devoid of evidence that his former counsel moved to withdraw from this matter. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.17(b) (stating that an Immigration Judge may permit an attorney to withdraw “only upon oral or written motion”); Matter of Rosales, 19 I&N Dec. 655 (BIA 1988). The respondent has not established that the Postal Service did not deliver the notice to his former counsel. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). The mere allegation that the respondent’s former attorney did not advise the respondent of his hearing does not establish that he did not receive notice of his hearing in accordance with the applicable statutes and regulations. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c)(2), 1292.5(a). Accordingly, we conclude that, by mailing the Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings to the respondent’s former counsel, the respondent was placed on notice of his removal hearing and reopening is not warranted on account of lack of notice.
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent’s appellate arguments (i.e., a claim that his former counsel did not notify him of the time, date and place of his aforementioned removal hearing or did not file a motion to withdraw) can be construed as allegation that ineffective assistance of counsel amounted to an “““exceptional circumstance” causing his failure to appear at his hearing, such claims are untimely under section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act and not in compliance with the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
As the respondent has not otherwise established that these proceedings should be reopened sua sponte, we will not disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrew Friedman, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated May 15, 2013, ordering his removal from the United States. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. Inasmuch as the respondent, through counsel, conceded that he is subject to removal from the United States because he is an alien who is present in this country without being admitted or paroled or who arrived at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General, the respondent’s removability has been established by clear and convincing evidence (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 18; Exh. 1). See section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.10(c), 1240.8(c). Moreover, the respondent does not raise any meaningful argument on appeal which would cause this Board to disturb the Immigration Judge’s holding that he is also subject to removal from the United States as a result of his May 2012 New York state conviction for Strangulation in the Second Degree (I.J. at 4-6; Exhs. 1, 2; Tr. at 18). See section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act.
 
As the respondent is subject to removal from the United States, it is his burden to establish eligibility for relief from removal. Section 240(c)(4)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). However, the respondent has not filed an application for any form of relief from removal which can be granted by an Immigration Judge or this Board. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.1(a)(1) (enumerating many of the forms of relief from removal which can be granted by an Immigration Judge). The respondent, through counsel, expressly declined the opportunity to file an Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal (Form I-589) because “[h]e doesn’t have any fear of returning to his country” (Tr. at 27; I.J. at 4).
 
To the extent that the respondent appears to be arguing that his counsel provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel by not filing a Form I-589, he has not complied with any of the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), nor established that he was prejudiced by his counsel’s decision not to file a Form I-589 in these proceedings.
 
*2 The respondent’s desire to seek post-conviction relief with the New York courts did not amount to “good cause” for a continuance (I.J. at 4-6). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 1240.6. The respondent has not presented evidence that he has actually filed for post-conviction relief, nor evidence that such claims will likely be successful. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (holding that the statements of counsel are not evidence); see also Heredia v. Holder, 516 F.App’x. 63 (2d Cir. 2013) (holding that an alien could not demonstrate that an Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his request for a continuance constituted an abuse of discretion under any standard so established because he failed to submit evidence of a pending motion to vacate); cf. Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009) (recognizing that a continuance may be warranted where an alien has presented evidence that he is the beneficiary of a pending immigrant visa petition and established a likelihood of success on an application for adjustment of status). Overall, considering the lack of evidence contained in the record to corroborate the claims of the respondent’s counsel, the speculative nature of post-conviction proceedings, and the amount of time that the respondent was provided to present his claims, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s request for a continuance.
 
The respondent has also not established that he was prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his request for a continuance. Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). Even in the absence of his aforementioned conviction, the respondent would still be subject to removal from the United States because he is an alien who is present in this country without being admitted or paroled or who arrived at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General. While the respondent apparently seeks cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1), he has not articulated any basis to hold that, in the absence of his disqualifying conviction, he would be able to establish that his removal from the United States would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative as required by section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act. Matter of Monreal, 23 I&N Dec. 56, 65 (BIA 2001).
 
For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to order the respondent removed from the United States to Ecuador. The following order is entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX8 879 - Newark, NJ

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anayancy R. Housman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joseph Silver
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s May 23, 2013, decision denying his motion to reconsider1 the Immigration Judge’s underlying April 23, 2013, decision denying his motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) urges affirmance of both of the Immigration Judge’s decisions. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that in a decision dated June 23, 2010, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed following a hearing conducted on an in absentia basis. It is undisputed that although the respondent’s former attorney (Cynthia N. Grob) appeared at that hearing, the respondent did not. With the assistance of new counsel (Robert Cygan) the respondent filed a motion to reopen on March 13, 2013 (which was subsequently supplemented by additional documentation filed April 4, 2013). The respondent sought reopening to rescind his in absentia order in light of his claim that he did not receive notice of his June 23, 2010, hearing. In addition, the respondent asserted that “““exceptional circumstances” accounted for his failure to appear at that proceeding due to the ineffective assistance provided by attorney Grob, who allegedly never notified him of his June 23, 2010, court date. Finally, the respondent sought reopening for adjustment of status consideration based on his contention that he was married to a United States citizen (USC), with whom he has two USC children.
 
In a decision dated April 23, 2013, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s March 13, 2013, motion to reopen, as supplemented. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had received actual notice of the hearing in question, as he was present at his February 25, 2010, hearing at which his next scheduled hearing for June 23, 2010, was announced, and for which notice was provided in writing. See April 23, 2013, I.J. dec. at 2-3; Notice of Hearing dated February 25, 2010.
 
As to the respondent’s claim of exceptional circumstances accounting for his failure to appear due to alleged ineffective assistance provided by attorney Grob, the Immigration Judge concluded that the evidence submitted was insufficient to satisfy the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Further, the Immigration Judge noted that even if the Lozada requirements were otherwise satisfied (given a previously-submitted affidavit by attorney Grob), the respondent’s motion to reopen to rescind based on his exceptional circumstances claim was filed years after his in absentia hearing had been completed. The Immigration Judge went on to conclude that equitable tolling of the time limit for filing the reopening request based on such claims did not apply, as the respondent did not exercise due diligence regarding these claims. See April 23, 2013, I.J. dec. at 3-4.
 
*2 In addition, the Immigration Judge did not sua sponte reopen the respondent’s proceedings for adjustment of status consideration. Ibid. at 4-5. The Immigration Judge noted that a prima facie showing of eligibility for such relief had not been made, as there was no indication that a visa petition filed in the respondent’s behalf had been approved. Also noted was the absence of any evidence confirming that the respondent was married, that his wife was a USC, and that he and “Olivo Almonte” (the named beneficiary of the visa petition that was filed) are one and the same person. The Immigration Judge did, however, specifically state “the Court may reconsider its position if additional evidence were provided.” Ibid. at 5.
 
In response, the respondent, with the assistance of attorney Cygan, filed a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Court (to which additional documentation was appended) in an effort to cure the noted evidentiary deficiencies of his previously-filed motion insofar as he sought reopening for adjustment of status consideration. See Motion filed May 3, 2013. On May 23, 2013, the Immigration Judge denied this motion for lack of a showing that the respondent is the beneficiary of an approved visa petition, and because the evidence submitted did not demonstrate that he and “Olivo J. Almonte” (as listed in the submitted evidence) are the same person.
 
We now turn to the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of both his March 13, 2013, motion to reopen (as supplemented), and his May 3, 2013, motion to reconsider (with additionally-submitted documentation). The respondent challenges these decisions by reiterating his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney Grob (regarding whether he received notice his June 23, 2010, hearing), and asserting for the first time that he received ineffective assistance from attorney Cygan2 in connection with his motions to reopen and reconsider filed in Immigration Court.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
Regarding the denial of the respondent’s March 13, 2013, motion to reopen, as supplemented, we first observe that this filing is effectively three motions (i.e., a motion to reopen to rescind his in absentia order based on a claim of lack of notice, a motion to reopen to rescind his in absentia order based on a claim of exceptional circumstances/ineffective assistance by attorney Grob, and a motion for sua sponte reopening to apply for adjustment of status). Each of these motions is subject to different statutory and regulatory requirements.
 
As to the denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen to rescind his in absentia order based on a claim of lack of notice (for which there is no filing deadline), the respondent does not dispute (and has not addressed) on appeal the Immigration Judge’s findings that he received actual notice of his June 23, 2010, hearing, and that such notice was given orally and in writing at his February 25, 2010, hearing that both he and attorney Grob attended. See April 23, 2013, I.J. dec. at 2-3. Moreover, the respondent makes no claim that these findings are “clearly erroneous.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). Under the circumstances presented, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen to rescind the respondent’s in absentia order based on a lack of notice claim.
 
*3 Concerning the denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen seeking rescission of his in absentia order based on exceptional circumstances owing to alleged ineffective assistance by attorney Grob after his February 25, 2010, hearing, this motion (filed March 13, 2013, as supplemented) was untimely by more than 2-1/2 years. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (providing that such motions must be filed within 180 days of the order of removal).
 
Further, there was no showing below, and the respondent has not persuasively argued on appeal, that this 180-day motion to reopen filing deadline is equitably tolled, even assuming, without deciding, that such tolling is available under prevailing circuit law in cases such as this. The respondent admits that on June 24, 2010, he was advised by Immigration Court personnel that he had been ordered removed in absentia the previous day. He now reiterates that he “immediately consulted another attorney” after his in absentia order was entered. However, he has not explained what action he took to actively pursue his claims of ineffective assistance against attorney Grob in the years following that consultation.3
 
The fact remains that no motion to reopen seeking rescission of the respondent’s in absentia order was ever filed until April 23, 2013 (when attorney Cygan did so in Immigration Court), based on a claim of exceptional circumstances/ineffective assistance by attorney Grob. On this record, the respondent has not shown that he acted with due diligence in pursuing and presenting his claims of ineffective assistance by attorney Grob. Accordingly, his motion to reopen to rescind his in absentia order based on his claim of exceptional circumstances (accounting for his failure to appear at his June 23, 2010, hearing) was correctly denied by the Immigration Judge on this basis alone. As such, we need not address the remaining arguments concerning the alleged ineffective assistance provided by attorney Grob, and the alleged ineffective assistance by attorney Cygan insofar as the motion he filed rested on such claims.4
 
As to the respondent’s denial of sua sponte reopening for adjustment of status consideration,5 and notwithstanding the respondent’s arguments on appeal, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s resolution of this issue, as addressed in both his April 23, 2013, and May 23, 2013, decisions, based on the evidence then before him.
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s decisions in this regard based on claims of ineffective assistance by attorney Cygan. The respondent contends that attorney Cygan rendered ineffective assistance in filing his motions to reopen and to reconsider by not including certain documentation and evidence in support of his ultimate request for adjustment of status. See Brief at 7. He now provides supporting documentation of the type he claims should have been submitted by attorney Cygan (e.g., his personal attestation that his true and correct name is Olivo Jose Almonte, and other evidence and documentation confirming this point, and to demonstrate that he is the same person listed in previously-submitted documentation, including regarding the visa petition filed by his USC wife). Ibid. at 10, and Tabs A-F.
 
*4 Even if this newly-provided evidence had been submitted by attorney Cygan with the respondent’s motion to reopen and/or motion to reconsider filed in Immigration Court, this evidence still would have been insufficient to establish his prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status at that time as he did not, and indeed could not, demonstrate that the visa petition filed in his behalf by his USC wife had been approved. See April 23, 2010, I.J. dec. at 4. Thus, even assuming, without deciding, that the respondent’s current submissions demonstrate compliance with the procedural requirements for presenting an ineffective assistance claim against attorney Cygan based on the aforementioned contentions, he has not also established that “there exists a reasonable probability that the Immigration Judge may have granted [his] motion to reopen had it been adequately prepared.” Brief at 7.
 
We also decline to sua sponte reopen the respondent’s proceedings for adjustment of status consideration, as there has been no showing of exceptional circumstances warranting such action. 8 U.S.C. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). We also observe that the respondent has yet to establish that the immediate relative spousal visa petition filed by his USC wife has been approved. Therefore, he currently is unable to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. We also observe that the visa petition in his behalf was not filed by his wife until March 22, 2013, more than 2-1/2 years after his final order of removal was entered on June 23, 2010.
 
Based on the foregoing considerations, the appeal is dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In his May 23, 2013, decision, the Immigration Judge noted (at 1) that this motion (filed May 3, 2013), was “a motion to reconsider [the April 23, 2013, denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen] with additional documentary evidence.” The Immigration Judge entered an order (at 3) denying the motion to reconsider. He also entered an order (at 3) denying the respondent’s “motion to reopen of April 23, 2013.” See May 23, 2013, I.J. dec. at 3. It is readily apparent, however, that in so ordering the Immigration Judge mistakenly identified the date of the respondent’s motion to reopen. The record clearly reflects that the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed March 13, 2013, and was supplemented on April 4, 2013. The record also clearly reflects that the Immigration Judge denied this motion to reopen on April 23, 2013. The parties have not raised this matter on appeal. We view this Immigration Judge mistake to be harmless error.

2

On appeal, the respondent questions whether Mr. Cygan is an attorney. See, e.g., Respondent’s Brief on Appeal (Brief) at 5-6 and Tab A (respondent’s August 16, 2013, affidavit (identifying himself as “Olivo Jose Almonte”) at 3-4). However, the record reflects that Mr. Cygan swore under penalty of perjury that he was an attorney and a member in good standing of the New Jersey bar, as evidenced by his Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28), filed March 13, 2013, in Immigration Court. In any event, on this record there has been no showing that Mr. Cygan was not an attorney during the time he represented the respondent, or that he is not currently an attorney.

3

The respondent does not recall the name of this attorney. In addition, the respondent neither asserts (nor has filed a motion to reopen based on) ineffective assistance by this attorney, who remains unnamed.

4

Similarly, we need not address other issues raised by this case, including whether the respondent’s submissions are sufficient to satisfy the Lozada requirements for presenting a claim of ineffective assistance against attorney Grob, and whether the respondent’s motion to reopen to rescind his in absentia order based on exceptional circumstances is number barred pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (providing that an alien may file only one motion to reopen seeking rescission of a removal order entered in absentia).

5

Insofar as in his March 13, 2013, motion to reopen, as supplemented, the respondent sought reopening for adjustment of status consideration, his motion (which was subject to the 90-day filing deadline for reopening requests) was untimely, and its late filing was not otherwise excused under the exceptions provided by law. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(3), (4).

IN RE: SONIA KARINA PINEDA-ZEPEDA
File: AXXX XX0 138 - San Francisco, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Monica N. Ganjoo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on April 29, 2004, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen her proceedings and to rescind an in absentia order of removal. On July 18, 2013, over 9 years after the Board’s order, the respondent filed the current motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). It is also number-barred, as it is the second motion to reopen filed in this case. Section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent argues that her proceedings should be reopened and the in absentia order should be rescinded because she did not receive her notice of March 11, 2003, hearing. There is no time limitation to a motion to reopen removal proceedings and rescind an in absentia order based on the lack of notice. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) and (c)(7)(C)(iii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3), 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). However, such motions are still subject to the number limitation. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (noting that an “alien may file only one motion” to reopen and rescind an in absentia order entered in removal proceedings). As noted above, the respondent’s motion is the second motion to reopen filed in her case, therefore it is number barred and will be denied.
 
Even if we were to consider the respondent’s argument that she did not receive the notice of hearing, we would find little merit in her claim. The record in this case indicates that the notice of the March 11, 2003, hearing was sent to the respondent by mail to her San Francisco, CA, address (Exh. 6), and there is no indication that this notice was returned undelivered. In addition, the record indicates that the Immigration Judge’s decision was also mailed to the same address at a separate time, and this document was not returned undelivered. The respondent admits in her motion and affidavit that this was her correct address and that she received the in absentia removal order from the Immigration Court at this address, but she now claims that she never received the Notice of Hearing (“NOH”) from the Immigration Court at this address (Motion at 2, 5; 13-15). However, we observe that the respondent did not claim that she did not receive the NOH from the Immigration Court in her prior motion to reopen or affidavit attached to that motion or on appeal, and only claimed in this prior motion and affidavit that her failure to appear at the hearing was due to her inability to understand English. Under these circumstances, while we acknowledge the respondent’s argument that she had an incentive to appear at her hearing to pursue an asylum claim, we would not find that the respondent has shown that the presumption of delivery has been rebutted, even if her motion were not number-barred. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674-76 (BIA 2008); Matter of C-R-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 677 (BIA 2008).
 
*2 In the alternative, the respondent urges that the numerical limitations on motions to reopen and rescind an in absentia order should be equitably tolled because she is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and 240(c)(7)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) & (c)(7)(A) (setting forth time and number limits on motions to reopen and rescind in absentia orders of removal); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3) & 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (same); see also Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that equitable tolling can apply to the numerical limitations on motions to reopen).
 
First, the respondent has not substantially complied with the Lozada1 procedural requirements. See Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893 (9th Cir. 2008). While she asserts that she apprised prior counsel of the allegations lodged against him, the only evidence submitted in support of this assertion is a photocopy of a vague email purportedly to her prior counsel’s email address. We do not find this sufficient notice to her prior counsel. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598-99 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding that alien did not comply with Lozada where he did not submit an affidavit and did not provide former counsel with an adequate opportunity to respond to allegation). Second, the respondent has not demonstrated that she acted with due diligence in pursuing her claim prior to filing the instant motion on July 18, 2013, over 9 years after the Board’s prior decision. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra, at 897. Third, the respondent has not demonstrated that she was prejudiced by her prior counsel’s actions or inactions. Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 153 (9th Cir. 1999) (finding that prejudice must be shown for a due process challenge and that prejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected outcome); see also Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004) (an alien can show prejudice where counsel’s performance “may have affected the outcome of the proceedings”). Here, the respondent seeks to apply for asylum and withholding of removal. However, she has not articulated a basis for her claim nor or any evidence to establish her prima facie eligibility for relief. Thus, the motion to reopen is untimely, number-barred, and the respondent has not shown due diligence or prejudice to warrant equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*3 Finally, although not explicitly requested, the respondent has not shown that an “exceptional situation” exists that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte, particularly given her lengthy criminal history. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “““as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: ANDREI JOSE PICADO
File: AXXX XX0 226 - Orlando, FL
September 25, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eva Kozlowska, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent was ordered removed in absentia by an Immigration Judge on May 26, 2011. His first motion to reopen that order was denied by an Immigration Judge on October 13, 2011, and on January 26, 2012, the Board found that the appeal of that decision was untimely filed. The respondent then filed a second motion to reopen which was also denied by an Immigration Judge, and the Board dismissed the appeal of that decision on March 29, 2013. On June 25, 2013, the respondent submitted the instant motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The record will be remanded.
 
An alien who seeks to reopen removal proceedings following the entry of an in absentia removal order must demonstrate that the alien’s failure to appear was due to “exceptional circumstances.” Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). Ineffective assistance of counsel may be an exceptional circumstance only if the alien shows prejudice. Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2005). A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may amount to exceptional circumstances “when an applicant’s failure to appear is due to his attorney’s errant instruction.” Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir. 2008) (concluding the respondent showed prejudice as his attorney told him he did not need to appear at hearing and that venue had been changed); see also Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472, 473-74 (BIA 1996) (a respondent showed prejudice where he was incorrectly informed by his attorney’s staff that there had been a continuance and he did not need to appear at the hearing).
 
The respondent contends that former counsel, Ms. Goldenberg, provided ineffective assistance by not telling him that his motion to change venue was denied or that he had to appear at his scheduled hearing, and as counsel did not appear at the hearing herself, or make alternative arrangements for his representation. The respondent further notes that counsel filed a facially defective motion to change venue, an untimely appeal before the Board, and an untimely motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge. While the record reflects that the noted submissions were filed pro se, Ms. Goldenberg has not responded to the allegations that she, in fact, was responsible for filing them.
 
The respondent has submitted evidence reflecting compliance with the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (Motion, Tabs C, I, J). Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005). Moreover, as counsel’s errors prevented him from presenting his case, she caused him prejudicial harm. In light of this record, we find it appropriate to grant the respondent’s motion to reopen, vacate the prior decisions, and remand the record for further proceedings. Accordingly, the following orders shall be issued.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decisions dated January 26, 2012, and March 29, 2013, and the Immigration Judge’s decisions dated May 26, 2011, November 14, 2011, and March 29, 2012, are hereby vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph J. Huprich, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 15, 2012, decision denying his untimely motion to reopen based on his claim of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent does not dispute that his motion to reopen was untimely filed (I.J. at 2). Rather, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in finding he did not meet his burden in establishing he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel when his former counsel conceded removability as charged, did not file a motion to withdraw the pleadings, and did not file an application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). In this regard, the Immigration Judge concluded the respondent did not establish the doctrine of equitable tolling applied in his case because he did not provide any information as to when he became aware of the alleged deficient representation to show due diligence in filing the motion and did not comply at all with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), to establish ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 2-4). See Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2007) (equitable tolling requirements); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002) (requirements to succeed on ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge issued her decision denying the motion “prematurely” because current counsel had not obtained the transcript of the proceedings despite his request to the Immigration Court and that prior counsel’s ineffective assistance should have been evident to the Immigration Judge just from a review of the record. Notwithstanding the respondent’s contentions on appeal, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen for the reasons stated in his decision (I.J. at 2-4). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2013) (de novo review).
 
In support of his contention that the Immigration Judge acted prematurely in rendering her decision on the motion, the respondent relies on Dent v. Holder, 627 F.3d 365 (9th Cir. 2010), and argues that the Immigration Judge should have waited until after counsel listened to the tapes of the prior proceedings before making his decision. However, we point out the decision in Dent dealt with the statutory mandate that an alien in removal proceedings be given access to his entry documents and any other records and documents, not considered by the Attorney General to be confidential, pertaining to his admission or presence in the United States. See id. at 374. It does not pertain to counsel’s ability to listen to tapes prior to filing a motion to reopen. We are unpersuaded by the respondent’s reliance on Dent in contending that the Immigration Judge acted prematurely in rendering her decision because counsel had not listened to the tapes of the prior proceedings.
 
*2 In addition, while the respondent has on appeal submitted an affidavit in an attempt to show he has substantially complied with Lozada, he has not complied with any of the other Lozada requirements and, notably, has not presented evidence showing that he is not removable as charged and/or that he is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, as alleged (I.J. at 3-4).1 In this regard we note that the respondent, through prior counsel, conceded his removability as charged based on an illegal entry in December 2005 (I.J. at 2). See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). The respondent claims on appeal that he was lawfully admitted to the United States with a visitor’s visa, a copy of which he provided on appeal, with an expiration date in 2011 and, as a result, former counsel should not have conceded removability and should have filed a motion to withdraw the pleadings.
 
However, the respondent has not provided evidence showing that he was lawfully admitted and states in his affidavit he told prior counsel he was lawfully admitted, was advised by prior counsel to obtain the necessary evidence, and he never did so. Thus, it appears prior counsel had a sufficient factual basis upon which to make the concessions to the facts and charges in the Notice to Appear and a sufficient basis to believe the respondent is ineligible for adjustment of status due to his illegal entry. Cf. Santiago-Rodriguez v. Holder, 657 F.3d 820 (9th Cir. 2011) (finding counsel provided ineffective assistance to alien by admitting to factual allegation without any factual basis for doing so). Under these circumstances, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX7 402 - New York, NY
September 17, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Perham Makabi, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen on July 19, 2013, after we issued a final removal order on June 9, 2011. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion to reopen, to which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), has not responded, will be denied.1
 
The motion contends that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel, in that counsel did not inform him that he might seek voluntary departure (Respondent’s Mot. at 5; section 240B(b) of the Act). However, there is no statement or affidavit from the respondent concerning the claims in the motion. Statements of counsel are not evidence. See, e.g., INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980).
 
As no affidavit from the respondent is presented, the motion does not show that he acted with diligence in filing the motion two years after our final removal order. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 131 (2d Cir. 2008) (“no matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence in pursuing his claim”) (citation omitted); Wang v. Board of Immigration Appeals, 508 F.3d 710 (2d Cir. 2007)(diligence must be shown by respondent wishing to pursue an untimely motion). Moreover, the respondent does not comply with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Debeatham v. Holder, 602 F.3d 481, 484 (2d Cir. 2010). Most critically, the motion does not present “. . . an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement with former counsel concerning what action would be taken and what counsel did or did not represent in this regard.” Id. (citations omitted). The motion is, therefore, denied.

The respondent was removed to Ecuador on July 19, 2013. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held in Luna v. Holder, 637 F.3d 85 (2d Cir. 2011), that we must consider a statutory motion to reopen, even if the alien is no longer in the United States. We deny the respondent’s motion on the merits, and therefore do not reach the applicability of Luna to this case.

File: AXXX XX0 957 - Baltimore, MD
September 13, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Laurence F. Johnson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Amy S. Paulick
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(B)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(B)(i)(I)] - Nonimmigrant - no valid passport
 
Lodged: Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)] - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
 
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
 
The respondent timely appeals from the Immigration Judge’s January 26, 2012, decision denying the respondent’s application for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“the Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her application. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) asserts that the Immigration Judge’s decision is correct and should be affirmed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen from South Korea who entered the United States on August 9, 2005. The respondent was placed in removal proceedings because DHS alleged that she was not in possession of a valid immigrant visa at the time she filed her adjustment of status application (I.J. at 2). The primary issue on appeal is summarized in the Form I-485 denial letter (DHS Group Exh. 1A) and overseas investigation (DHS Group Exh. 1B and 1C), which outline the discrepancies and concerns regarding the letter of employment the respondent submitted to support her application for adjustment of status (I.J. at 6-10).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that she would have been able to explain the discrepancies and errors if she had not received ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent, however, did not comply with the procedural requirements for filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as enunciated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741 (4th Cir. 2006) (finding no compliance with Lozada), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1182 (2007). Accordingly, that issue is not properly before us.
 
The respondent additionally offers new evidence to explain or clarify issues highlighted in the overseas investigation report and relied upon by the Immigration Judge in reaching the adverse credibility finding. We have not considered the evidence the respondent submitted to the Board. The Board is an appellate body whose function is to review, not create, a record. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984). To the extent this evidence is new, the respondent has not filed a motion to remand, and we cannot consider new evidence presented for the first time on appeal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Moreover, the respondent has not shown how this new evidence was not previously available and could not have been presented at her hearing before the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992). As previously discussed, the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim does not warrant a remand for further discussion of this evidence because she did not comply with the procedural requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, supra. Consequently, we adjudicated the appeal based upon the evidence contained in the record when it was before the Immigration Judge.
 
*2 Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Immigration Judge’s adverse credibility finding is not clearly erroneous (I.J. at 9-10). The Immigration Judge’s findings in that regard are supported by DHS’s overseas investigation, which was not rebutted by the respondent (DHS Group Exh. 1A-C). Moreover, the respondent has not presented any persuasive arguments on appeal which warrant reversing the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s adjustment of status and 212(i) waiver applications. Thus, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: ARCHIBALD CLAUDIUS RICHARD HALL
File: AXXX XX2 153 - New York, NY
September 9, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicholas J. Mundy, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Marguerite C. Mills
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This respondent moves the Board to reconsider its June 28, 2013, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind an order of removal entered in absentia on March 16, 2006. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g). The motion will be denied.
 
In its prior order, the Board found that equitable tolling of the filing deadline imposed on motions to reopen and rescind was not warranted in this case because the respondent did not comply with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board, and he did not establish that he acted with due diligence in bringing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may qualify as an exceptional circumstance and serve to equitably toll the 180-day limitation period for filing a motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal. See Aris v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 599 (2d Cir. 2008); Iavorski v. I.N.S., 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000). To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, however, the alien must substantially comply with the procedures set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Yi Long Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133, 142-43 (2d Cir. 2007); Twum v. I.N.S., 411 F.3d 54, 59 (2d Cir. 2005). Moreover, an alien seeking equitable tolling based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must show that he exercised due diligence during the entire period he seeks to toll. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir.2008); Jian Hua Wang v. B.I.A., 508 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir. 2007).
 
In the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind, he did not offer evidence that his former attorney had been informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. Further, the motion did not reflect whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and it did not include an explanation for why a complaint had not been filed. Id. See also Garcia-Martinez v. Department of Homeland Security, 448 F.3d 511 (2d Cir. 2006). The respondent therefore did not substantially comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. Failure to comply with the Lozada requirements constitutes a forfeiture of the ineffective assistance claim. See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46 (2d Cir. 2005).
 
*2 Further, the respondent did not show that he exercised due diligence during the entire period he seeks to toll. The respondent stated that he never heard from his former attorney after he met with the attorney a few days after the March 16, 2006, court date. See Motion to Reopen and Rescind at 8. The respondent, however, did not explain what efforts he made to contact his former attorney or to ascertain the status of his case in the 7 years that elapsed between their last meeting and the filing of the motion to reopen and rescind on April 16, 2013. In sum, the Board finds no error of fact or law in our prior order to warrant reconsideration. See Matte of O-S-G-, supra.
 
With the instant motion, the respondent has submitted a supplement to his motion to reopen and rescind that is dated June 21, 2013. See Motion Exhibit E. In that document, the respondent emphasizes that his former attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel when he also failed to appear at the March 16, 2006, hearing. The respondent asserts that although he previously submitted the supplement to the Board, the Board did not consider it in its June 28, 2013, decision. See Motion to Reconsider at 4.
 
In rendering its prior order, the Board considered a supplement to the motion that was filed on May 17, 2013. The Board has no record of receiving the supplemental document, dated June 21, 2013, prior to the filing of the instant motion, and the respondent has offered no evidence of its mailing to or receipt by the Board prior to its June 28, 2013, order. Even if the Board had received the document, the argument therein would not have altered its decision because the respondent neither set forth an ineffective assistance of counsel complaint in substantial compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, nor demonstrated that he acted with due diligence in bringing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the respondent’s motion to reconsider will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Paul Hunker
Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On July 5, 2013, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings in which the Board dismissed his appeal on January 23, 2013. The Board granted his associated request for a stay of removal on July 16, 2013. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely as it was filed more than 90 days after the Board’s decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). However, he contends that equitable tolling is appropriate as former counsel provided him with ineffective assistance. Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir. 2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). With his motion he has included an affidavit, and evidence that he informed former counsel of the allegations against him and filed a state bar complaint in this regard (Motion, Tabs J, K).
 
To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel in an immigration proceeding, the respondent must demonstrate substantial prejudice resulting from counsel’s performance. Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n. 2 (5th Cir. 2001). Proving prejudice requires that the respondent make a prima facie showing that, absent counsel’s deficient performance, he would have been entitled to the relief he sought. Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994).
 
The respondent raises several allegations of error by former counsel, including: asserting that he misrepresented to the respondent the events at his initial hearing; whether he presented an unpublished Board decision to the Immigration Judge; and counsel’s actions with respect to challenging the moral turpitude charge and the Immigration Judge’s evaluation of the same. We initially note that an Immigration Judge and this Board are not bound by either unpublished Board decisions, or by the out-of-circuit cases cited in the respondent’s motion (Motion at 11, 28-29). Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25, 31 (BIA 1989) (explaining that the Board historically follows a court’s precedent in cases arising in that circuit). Therefore, counsel’s alleged failure to ensure that an unpublished decision was presented before the Immigration Judge is not, without more, prejudicial. We also note that the decision cited by the respondent does not stand for the proposition that the respondent’s conviction is not a crime involving moral turpitude, but rather remands for the type of analysis conducted by the Board in in this case in evaluating the respondent’s appeal.
 
*2 In addition, the Board has already addressed in detail whether the Immigration Judge properly found the respondent removable as charged. In doing so, the Board acknowledged the manner in which the Immigration Judge conducted his analysis, and in turn evaluated the issue of the respondent’s removability in light of the proper analytical methodology. Thus, the respondent has not shown that he was substantially prejudiced as a result of former counsel’s alleged deficient performance.
 
As we find that the respondent has not demonstrated that his motion is subject to equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel, his motion is untimely and reopening is not warranted. Lara v. Trominski, supra. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Yaw Akuoko, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Abby L. Meyer
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Liberia, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated October 18, 2011, that denied his motion to reconsider the Immigration Judge’s prior July 27, 2011, decision that denied his motion to reopen a prior September 22, 2010, decision that granted the respondent’s application for pre-conclusion voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), (b)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the respondent’s motion to reconsider. On appeal, the respondent has submitted additional evidence to establish that his former counsel’s representation was ineffective. See Respondent’s Brief at 3-5, Exhs. A & B. We construe this evidence and argument as a motion to remand the record. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion will be denied.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge, with the following notations. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The respondent does not contest the Immigration Judge’s finding that his motion to reconsider was untimely because it was not filed within 30 days of the final administrative decision in this case (I.J. at 2; Resp. Br. at 2). See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). Therefore, we consider the issue waived. See Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 261 n.1 (BIA 2007). It follows that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider because it was time-barred. Id.
 
However, even assuming that the respondent’s motion was timely filed, we uphold the Immigration Judge’s alternative finding denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider on the merits of the claim (I.J. at 1-2). A motion to reconsider requests that the Immigration Judge reexamine his decision in light of the additional legal arguments, a change in the law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. This motion, therefore, must specify the errors of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s decision and be supported by any pertinent precedential authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The respondent’s Motion to Reconsider does not identify any material error of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s decision. He has not asserted that there has been a change of law or that an aspect of the case was overlooked. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, supra; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2). Rather, the respondent asserts that his August 30, 2011, Motion to Reconsider and his January 21, 2011, Motion to Reopen, were untimely due to errors in the fees attached to the motions and due to attorney error in ensuring that these motions were timely filed. See Motion to Reconsider, Preliminary Statement & Item 10). However, no contentions regarding ineffective assistance of counsel were explicitly raised before the Immigration Judge.1
 
*2 The only substantive argument raised in the Motion to Reconsider was that the September 2010 decision should be reopened to allow the DHS to exercise prosecutorial discretion. See Motion to Reconsider at Item 15-22. This argument is unavailing as the Immigration Judge and the Board do not have authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion, and the DHS, which has such authority, has consistently and affirmatively opposed the respondent’s attempts to reopen the September 22, 2010, decision. See DHS Opposition to Motion to Reopen (2/11/11); DHS Opposition to Motion to Reconsider (9/12/11); DHS Brief on Appeal (1/5/12).
 
The respondent also contends that the denial of the Motion to Reopen should be reconsidered on the basis that the respondent is eligible for Deferred Enforcement Departure (Temporary Protected Status) for natives and citizens of Liberia (Resp. Br. at 6). See Motion to Reconsider at Items 5-14. However, this issue does not address any error of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s October 2011 decision denying the motion to reopen due to the motion being approximately 30 days late (I.J. (7/27/11) at 1).2 Thus, the Immigration Judge properly concluded that reconsideration was not warranted because the respondent did not establish that he made any error of fact or law (I.J. at 2).
 
Furthermore, the respondent also has not met his heavy burden to establish that remand of the record for further proceedings is warranted. A motion to remand must conform to the same standard as a motion to reopen when the respondent seeks to present new evidence, but will only be granted if the new evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); Matter of Ige, 20 I&N Dec. 880, 884 (BIA 1984). In the current case, the respondent has not established that the evidence attached to the brief on appeal could not have been presented before the Immigration Judge.
 
The respondent argues that the deadline for his Motion to Reconsider should be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance of his prior counsel, Isaac O. Babalola, Esquire.3 However, he has not substantially complied with the requirements to establish an ineffective assistance claim. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir. 2003); Matter of Compean, Bangaly, J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). To establish ineffective assistance, the respondent is required to submit an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts, a statement that sets forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel, evidence that the former counsel was informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond (or a report of counsel’s failure or refusal to respond), and a complaint filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not. Id.
 
*3 The respondent has submitted an affidavit that outlines his agreement with his prior counsel on the scope of the representation that was to be provided and the nature of the alleged ineffective assistance. See Respondent’s Brief, Exh. A. He also submitted a five sentence letter to his former counsel informing him that the respondent intended to file an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s October 2011 decision on the basis of ineffective assistance as “my motion was not filed on time, and the Immigration Judge denied the motion.” See Respondent’s Brief, Exh. B.
 
The letter and affidavit provided by the respondent are insufficient to meet the requirements to establish ineffective assistance by his prior counsel. While the respondent informed his prior counsel that he was submitting an ineffective assistance claim with the Board, he did not inform the attorney of any detailed allegations associated with this claim or invite the attorney to submit a rebuttal. The respondent stated in his affidavit that he was not filing any type of disciplinary complaint against his prior attorney as this attorney explained that the late filings of the motion to reopen and reconsider where due to scheduling errors. We are at a lost to understand how this explanation would justify the respondent’s failure to pursue redress with a disciplinary authority for an admission of ethical violations, which apparently occurred with both the motion to reopen and reconsider, when such behavior if continued in the future could adversely affect other unsuspecting clients. Further, without a formal complaint to the appropriate disciplinary authority, the respondent has not presented evidence sufficient to ensure that the substance of the accusation can be properly evaluated and demonstrate that the respondent’s allegations are not meritless or baseless. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra; Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639.
 
Based on the foregoing, the respondent has not met his heavy burden to demonstrate that if the record were remanded for further proceedings it is likely that the outcome of his case would be changed. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion is denied.

August 28, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ismael Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, filed an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated August 9, 2012, that denied her motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) did not file a brief. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i)-(ii).
 
The record indicates the respondent was ordered removed in absentia on January 16, 2002. On June 1, 2012, the respondent’s attorney filed a motion with the Immigration Judge, requesting that her proceedings be reopened to allow her to adjust status based on a visa petition application filed by her husband, who recently naturalized as a citizen of the United States. She alleges the Motion to Reopen was filed as soon as she was aware of her removal order; however, she also stated that in 2007 she retained another attorney who advised her of the removal order (Respondent’s Br. at 2-3). The respondent argues lack of notice as her reason for not attending the immigration hearing.
 
The Immigration Judge determined, based on the respondent’s representation in the motion, that she did not notify the Court of her new address after venue was changed to New York, New York (I.J. at 3).1 As such, she did not establish that proper notice of the hearing was not provided using her last address. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4); see Bhanot v. Chertoff, 474 F.3d 71, 73 (2d Cir. 2007) (holding that when the government sent notice of petitioner’s changed hearing date to his most recent address, a presumption of receipt applied); see also Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27, 38 (BIA 1995).
 
The notice of hearing provisions are satisfied when notice is sent to the last address provided by the respondent. Bhanot v. Chertoff, supra. In this case, the respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear containing the address warnings, and the Immigration Court mailed the hearing notice to the last address provided by the respondent to the DHS (I.J. at 2).
 
Additionally, the respondent became aware of her removal order in 2007 (I.J. at 2). The respondent did not comply with the procedural steps for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against the attorney she alleges to have retained at that time (I.J. at 3). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.25(b)(4)(ii); see Debeatham v. Holder, 602 F.3d 481, 484-85 (2d Cir. 2010) (finding that where a motion to reopen is based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988)). In light of the foregoing, we agree with the Immigration Judge that she did not establish an ineffective assistance claim on which to base an equitable tolling claim to excuse the untimeliness of the motion. Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely filed. She has not demonstrated that she qualifies for any of the exceptions to the deadlines for filing motions to reopen under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4) or that the deadline should be equitably tolled.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent submitted additional evidence concerning her son’s educational and mental health issues. Although we are sympathetic, we do not consider evidence first submitted on appeal. Further, we do not find that this evidence, when considered with the prior motion, provides a sufficient basis to warrant invoking sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) (providing the Board may reopen, sua sponte, cases where it has rendered a prior decision); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
Although the respondent requests voluntary departure, the circumstances here do not warrant reopening to allow her an opportunity to pursue this relief 10 years after the entry of a final removal order (Respondent’s Br. at 5).
 
The respondent may pursue a request for prosecutorial discretion with the DHS, as neither the Immigration Judge, nor this Board, has authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion in this case. See generally Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 349-50 (BIA 1982).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: CAMILA DE SOUZA
File: AXXX XX7 384 - Miami, FL

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Troy D. Harris, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michele Drucker
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Remand; adjustment of status; voluntary departure
 
This is the second time this case is before us. The respondent is a native and citizen of Brazil. The case originally was before us pursuant to a Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) appeal of an April 5, 2011, decision granting the respondent’s adjustment of status application.1 On June 14, 2012, we sustained DHS’s appeal and concluded that the respondent’s former husband was no longer a derivative grandfathered alien and was not eligible to adjust his status in that manner. We remanded the record solely in order for the Immigration Judge to determine eligibility for voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge found the respondent eligible for voluntary departure and granted her that form of relief on August 14, 2012. The Immigration Judge denied respondent’s request for a continuance in order to await the adjudication of an I-130 visa petition filed on her behalf on August 1, 2012, by her second husband, whom she married in March 2012. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal and deny her motion to remand.
 
In her Notice of Appeal, the respondent contends that her former counsel mistakenly concluded a grant of voluntary departure would not have any detrimental effect in Consular processing. The respondent does not appeal the denial of her request for a continuance and we consider that issue abandoned. Matter of Cervantes, 22 I&N Dec. 560, 561 n.1 (BIA 1999). Instead, the respondent asks us to remand the record pending the adjudication of the I-130 visa petition filed on her behalf by her second husband. She includes several documents in support of the bona fides of her marriage.
 
It appears that the respondent is making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim with regard to her former counsel’s assertion below that a grant of voluntary departure would not affect Consular processing of her instant visa petition. An ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be supported by (1) an affidavit from the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel regarding the litigation matters the attorney was retained to address, (2) documentary evidence that the counsel in question was informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond, and (3) proof that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to the alleged ineffective assistance (and if this is not filed, why it was not). Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). This respondent has not complied with any of the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, and we will deny her claim.
 
*2 The respondent also asks that we remand the proceedings so she can await the adjudication of her instant pending I-130 visa petition. The Board long has held that a motion to remand must meet the same standards as a motion to reopen. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-72 (BIA 1992). Specifically, the Board may deny a motion to remand where a respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for the relief sought or where the evidence to be submitted in support of the motion was not previously unavailable or material to the relief requested. Id. at 472. Further, the party moving to remand bears a “heavy burden” of proving that the new evidence would change the result in the case if it were remanded. Id. Finally, the Board may deny such a motion where the ultimate relief sought is discretionary and we would not grant the relief as a matter of discretion. Id.
 
The respondent was married while in proceedings and must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that her marriage is bona fide. Sections 204(g) and 245(e)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1154(g) and 1255. The respondent does submit some documentation in support of her motion to remand. However, we conclude that the evidence is not sufficient to meet the heavy burden of prima facie eligibility in this instance. Further, the respondent does not have an approved visa petition and has not provided an indication of when the visa petition might be adjudicated. Thus, it is not evident that the outcome of the respondent’s case would change and we will deny the respondent’s motion to remand. Finally, the record does not contain evidence that the respondent paid her voluntary departure bond and we will not reinstate voluntary departure on appeal.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be issued:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed and her motion to remand is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Loide Rosa Jorge, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carrie E. Johnston
Senior Attorney
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 13, 2013. We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment arising in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo, whereas we review findings of fact in such appeals under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under our de novo review, we conclude that the respondent did not show good cause warranting a further continuance to allow him another opportunity to seek post-conviction relief with the hope of having criminal convictions vacated. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. “[C]ollateral attacks upon the respondent’s conviction do not operate to negate the finality of his conviction unless and until the conviction is overturned.” Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The respondent’s prior attempt to seek post-conviction relief did not succeed, and the future likelihood of the respondent’s success in having his convictions vacated was and is unknown.1
 
The respondent has asserted that prior counsel provided ineffective assistance in the effort to seek post-conviction relief. We do not find that remand is warranted. First, the respondent’s assertion of ineffective assistance in his criminal matters is not a basis for remand in immigration proceedings. Second, the respondent has not shown substantial compliance with the procedures set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Matter of Lozada, we stated that a motion asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement between the respondent and his legal representative and what actions were to be taken on his behalf, (2) that the counsel whose reputation is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) an indication of whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. Most importantly, there is no evidence that prior counsel has been informed of the allegations against him and been given an opportunity to respond. Counsel’s assertion that the respondent’s fiancée has made efforts in that regard is not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980). Nor has the respondent provided evidence as to whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Justin Egeolu, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 18, 2012. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent was afforded proper notice of her hearing by the Immigration Court, inasmuch as written notice of the hearing was provided to the respondent’s counsel of record. Notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
Furthermore, the respondent has not set forth a claim of deficient performance of counsel in accordance with the procedural requirements of our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We disagree with the respondent’s appellate contention that she need not comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. Contrary to the respondent’s argument on appeal, the record does not clearly indicate that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, even if the record had clearly indicated that she received ineffective assistance from her former counsel, it would not excuse the respondent from substantial compliance with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. See Barry v. Gonzalez, 445 F.3d 741, 746-7 (4th Cir. 2006) (requiring “substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements). In support of the respondent’s contention that she need not comply with Matter of Lozada, supra, the respondent cites to Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582 (9th Cir. 2006) and Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893 (9th Cir. 2008); however, we are not bound by these decisions, inasmuch as they were not issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this matter arises. Although the respondent in this matter submitted a sworn statement setting forth her version of the facts in this matter, the respondent did not submit evidence that she informed former counsel of her allegations of ineffective assistance or file a disciplinary complaint with the appropriate authorities in accordance with Matter of Lozada, supra.1 In light of the foregoing, we find that the respondent has not met her burden of proof to demonstrate that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard Mendez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathon Foerstel
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 On October 5, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted the government’s unopposed motion to remand the record to this Board. The case had previously been before us on November 14, 2011, at which time we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings. Upon remand, both parties have submitted supplemental briefing.
 
In our November 14, 2011, decision, we found that the respondent had not submitted sufficient evidence to support his claim that he was prejudiced by his prior attorney’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel (Bd. Dec. at 1). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Specifically, we found that the while the respondent argued that his prior attorney erred in not pursuing adjustment of status, his motion did not contain an application for adjustment of status, nor did it contain other evidence that he is currently eligible for such relief (Bd. Dec. at 1). In its motion to remand before the Ninth Circuit, the government noted that the respondent, in his motion, also alleged that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to pursue an application for withholding of removal from Guatemala. The government further noted that our previous analysis regarding prejudice was too restrictive, and that the respondent needed only to demonstrate that his previous counsel’s ineffective assistance may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 646 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004).
 
Given the totality of the circumstances, we will vacate our November 14, 2011, decision and remand the record to the Immigration Court to further assess the respondent’s eligibility for relief from removal. The respondent has submitted evidence in substantial compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, and his motion was filed with due diligence. See Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Iturribarria v. INS, supra. Moreover, the respondent’s prior attorney indicated that the respondent wanted to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture at his hearing on March 10, 2011 (Tr. at 7), but no applications were ever presented in court. While we might disagree that the respondent’s prior attorney had a duty to tell the respondent to marry his girlfriend, the fact remains that the respondent may now be eligible for adjustment of status in conjunction with a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(h) of the Act. Given these circumstances, we find that the respondent’s prior attorney’s actions may have affected the outcome of his proceedings. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra. As such, we will remand the record to the Immigration Court for further proceedings regarding the respondent’s requests for relief from removal.
 
*2 ORDER: The Board’s November 14, 2011, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

On appeal the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in concluding that he did not exercise due diligence in seeking to reopen the proceedings. The respondent has submitted additional evidence on appeal, but has provided no persuasive explanation why such evidence was not previously available to him. The Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995).
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear was issued on June 20, 2000, and served on the respondent by regular mail on that date. During the proceedings on October 4, 2002, the respondent was given oral and written notice of his next hearing scheduled for December 20, 2002, and he was advised of the consequences of a failure to appear. The respondent’s former attorney, James Elliot Howard, Esquire, filed a motion to continue on December 19, 2002. The respondent did not appear for the hearing on December 20, 2002, and the Immigration Judge issued an in absentia order of removal.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent received notice of the hearing scheduled for December 20, 2002. Therefore, the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed untimely whether the respondent is seeking reopening under the rescission provisions pertaining to in absentia orders of removal, or the general motions to reopen provisions. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(4)(ii), 8 C.F.R. 1003.23(b)(1).
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the alien has satisfied the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has determined that the deadline for motions to reopen deportation proceedings may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 130 (2d Cir. 2000). However, in order to equitably toll the filing deadline for a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate that he has exercised due diligence during the entire period he seeks to toll. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008). This includes both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed. Id.; see also Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006) (court concluded that aliens had demonstrated that their counsel was ineffective in informing them that they did not need to appear at a hearing, but they had not met their burden of showing why they had not been diligent over a two-year period).
 
The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent has not demonstrated that he is entitled to equitable tolling, as he has not established that he acted with due diligence in this matter. The respondent states on appeal that Mr. Howard failed to properly file the correct documents in his divorce proceedings and that the divorce was ultimately denied, which is reflected in a document from the Supreme Court of the State of New York, dated March 14, 2003. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Exh. 10. The respondent indicates on appeal that he is unable to recall the exact year that Mr. Howard finally told him his immigration case was closed, but he did not know what being “closed” meant, and he contends that Mr. Howard did not advise the respondent that he had been ordered removed from the United States. However, the respondent has not met his burden of showing that he had been diligent during the entire period he seeks to toll. See Rashid v. Mukasey, supra. He indicates that as an uneducated taxi driver with a ninth-grade education, he could not have deduced the gravity of the fraudulent and unethical behavior of Mr. Howard. While the respondent explains that he did not know that he had been ordered removed in absentia in December 2002, and that he had contact with Mr. Howard in 2003, the respondent also states in his letter to Mr. Howard dated August 24, 2011, that Mr. Howard was not responsive to the respondent’s request for a copy of his files and he never heard from him again. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Exh. 15. The respondent has not stated that he contacted any other attorneys from 2003 until consulting with current counsel and filing a motion to reopen in June 2012. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not exercise due diligence as required for equitable tolling. See Rashid v. Mukasey, supra. Consequently, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul C. Agu, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christian Parke
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 17, 2012, denying his motion to reopen proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under a clearly erroneous standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent filed an untimely motion reopen arguing that the time limit for filing the motion should be equitably tolled due to the ineffective assistance of former counsel. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the motion is defective because it does not substantially comply with the procedural requirements outlined in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), or present a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (substantial fulfillment of the procedural requirements of Lozada, supra, is generally necessary to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel unless the record reflects a clear and obvious case of such). Moreover, the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by any of prior counsel’s actions or failure to act in this matter. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004) (a claim of ineffective representation must show that the allegedly deficient performance of former counsel may have affected the outcome in the case). The respondent merely makes vague assertions that his communications with prior counsel were “quite deplorable,” that “nothing meaningful was accomplished” at his one meeting with prior counsel, and that he was not informed of all possible relief available to him in these proceedings. While citing to pertinent case law, the brief submitted by the respondent on appeal reflects a similar lack of detail concerning the attorney-client relationship, and is devoid of any substantive argument to support the claim that the performance of prior counsel was deficient.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Genet Getachew, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider the Board’s May 9, 2013, decision dismissing his appeal from the Immigration Judge denial of a motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The respondent has not identified an error of fact or law in our prior order, but instead reasserts that his failure to appear at the January 17, 2012, hearing was the result of events which were out of his control. Specifically, he asserts that his attorney mailed the hearing notice to his obligor rather than to him. We considered these assertions in or prior order. We emphasized that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent, and that the respondent did not set forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel to constitute exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985). As the respondent has not shown that our prior order contained an error of fact or law, the motion to reconsider is denied.

Chandu Latey
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled (not sustained)

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of China, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 27, 2011. In that decision, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent has not shown “good cause” for any further adjournment of the proceedings (I.J. at 3), and the Immigration Judge sustained the charge of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) (I.J. at 4-5).1 See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6 (2013). Following the filing of the Notice of Appeal, we established a briefing schedule according to which the respondent’s appeal brief was due on February 10, 2012. The respondent did not submit a brief before the deadline. Instead, the respondent filed a motion to remand on April 11, 2013, in which she contends that her prior counsel by whom she was represented below and who initially represented her in this appeal provided ineffective assistance.2 See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Rivas, 26 I&N Dec. 130, 135 (BIA 2013) (“Motions to remand, like motions to reopen, are discretionary in nature, and the requirements for a motion to remand are essentially the same as for a motion to reopen.” (citing Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127, 138 (BIA 2009) and Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 256-57 (BIA 1985))). However, the respondent’s motion to remand will be denied, and the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent’s Notice of Appeal asserts that the respondent has been “““improperly charged” and argues without citation to evidence in the record of proceeding or the support of meaningful legal analysis that the respondent is not inadmissible under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Act. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(b). The Notice of Appeal reflects that the respondent intended to support her appeal with a subsequent appeal brief but, as already stated, that has not happened. Under these circumstances, we will dismiss the respondent’s appeal. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 820 (9th Cir. 2003) (“If the BIA was forced to decipher general statements of error, unsupported by specific factual or legal references, the BIA would have to spend time and resources reconstructing the proceedings before the IJ and building the petitioner’s legal case, in some instances only to conclude that the appeal was utterly without merit.” (citing Matter of Holguin, 13 I&N Dec 423, 424 (BIA 1969))); Matter of Keyte, 20 I&N Dec. 158, 159 (BIA 1990) (summarily dismissing an appeal where aliens alleged in Notice of Appeal that Immigration Judge’s decision was “unfair,” indicated intent to file a brief or written statement but did not and “neglected to specify whether the alleged error in the immigration judge’s decision lies with his interpretation of the facts or his application of legal standards.”).
 
*2 For the purpose of adjudicating the respondent’s motion to remand based on the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we will presume for the time being that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements for such claims as delineated in Matter of Lozada, supra. See, e.g., Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 937 n. 4 (9th Cir. 2003) (“We seldom reject ineffective assistance of counsel claims solely on the basis of Lozada deficiencies.” (citing Melkonian v. Ashcroft, 320 F.3d 1061, 1072 (9th Cir. 2003) and Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000))). According to the respondent’s declaration submitted in support of the motion (“Declaration of Liu, Zhe”), her prior counsel acted ineffectively by failing to: (1) inform the respondent of the availability of withholding of removal or any other alternative relief from removal; (2) file a Petition for Alien Relative of which the respondent is the intended beneficiary with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”); and (3) submit an appeal brief in support of the instant appeal. We will address each allegation in turn.
 
First, we accept that an attorney’s failure to advise his alien client of relief from removal for with the alien is eligible constitutes ineffective assistance. However, the respondent has not established that she is eligible for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), or under the regulations implementing the Convention Against Torture. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c).
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not a form of relief from removal. Rather, the ineffectiveness claim attempts to show that the respondent’s former counsel prejudiced her ability or opportunity to apply for withholding of removal. However, the prejudice only arises if the respondent can show a prima facie case for relief. In order to do this, the respondent must, at a minimum, claim that she faces a clear probability of prospective persecution or torture in China. Accordingly, she must submit an application for withholding of removal in support of the motion to remand, which “shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.” See section 240(c)(7)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(B); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent has not supported the motion to reopen with any applications for relief and no evidence relevant to her (theoretical) claim for withholding of removal. Thus, the respondent has not established that she was prejudiced by her former counsel’s assistance in this regard.3 See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003) (“To show a deprivation of due process caused by ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien must show that counsel’s ineffective performance prejudiced her.”).
 
*3 Second, the former counsel’s alleged failure to file a Petition for Alien Relative before USCIS is beyond the scope of the instant removal proceedings. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 106-07 (BIA 2009). Furthermore, the respondent was not yet married to the United States citizen spouse during the proceedings before the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 24-25).
 
And finally, accepting that the failure to file an appeal brief can constitute ineffective assistance, the respondent has once again not shown prejudice arising from this failure. That is, the respondent, through present counsel, has not elaborated on the allegations of error in the Notice to Appear, or otherwise asserted any independent allegations of error in the Immigration Judge’s September 27, 2011, decision. Without a showing that the Immigration Judge’s decision contained reversible factual or legal error, the respondent has not established prejudice from former counsel’s failure to file a supporting appeal brief. Cf. Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, supra, at 826 (“All the king’s horses and all the king’s men and the very best counsel in the world could not induce a contrary decision on this record on appeal to the BIA.”).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied, and the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We note that, when the Immigration Judge asked the respondent if she has “any fear of returning to China . . .,” the respondent was nonresponsive to the question (Tr. at 9). In addition, the record reflects that the Immigration Judge asked the respondent’s former counsel, “[I]s this going to be a withholding case?” The respondent’s counsel stated that it would not be (Tr. at 13, 24).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mark R. Barr, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lillian Alves
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board’s decision in this matter entered on December 7, 2009, sustained an appeal of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for further consideration. The Immigration Judge’s August 2, 2011, decision denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status. The Board entered the final administrative decision when this matter was last before us on February 14, 2013; our order dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision.1 The respondent filed this motion to reopen his removal proceedings on May 15, 2013. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7). The DHS has filed a memorandum opposing the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The Board may consider a timely motion to reopen if it is supported by evidence of material new facts to be proven at a reopened hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The new evidence must have been previously unavailable and must be likely to lead to a different outcome in the respondent’s case. Id., see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1988) (explaining that a party who seeks to reopen proceedings before the Immigration Judge, with all the attendant delays, bears a “heavy burden” of proving that the new evidence would likely change the result in the case).
 
The evidence that the respondent offers in support of this motion was available previously, but the motion claims that it was not presented to the Immigration Judge due to ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of Attorney Litman, who represented the respondent at the hearing. The Board held in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), that an alien’s due process rights may be violated when ineffective assistance of counsel prevents the fundamental fairness of the proceeding and the alien shows prejudice.
 
The Immigration Judge found the respondent to be inadmissible, and therefore ineligible for adjustment of status, on the basis of “reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence” giving “reason to believe” that he has been an illicit drug trafficker or “a knowing aider, abettor, assister, conspirator, or colluder” in illicit drug trafficking. See section 212(a)(2)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C); Decision of the Board, Feb. 14, 2013, at 1. The Immigration Judge relied on specific evidence in the record, including police reports and sworn witness statements, indicating the respondent’s direct involvement in selling methamphetamine and cocaine as part of a network headed by his brother. There were at least five informants or witnesses who stated that the respondent served as a “runner” for his brother, and the statements were consistent and corroborative. See id. at 2; I.J. at 5-7.
 
*2 The respondent denies involvement. He asserts that Attorney Litman was ineffective in not submitting to the Immigration Judge approximately 696 pages of transcripts from the criminal trial in which the respondent was acquitted of several counts of possession or distribution of controlled substances, as well as several character references (who express their regard for the respondent and disbelief that he would be a drug trafficker, but do not rebut the specific information considered by the Immigration Judge). See Motion to Reopen, Tabs A, B.
 
The Immigration Judge and Board were aware of the acquittal. As we noted in our prior decision, the acquittal did not end the inquiry for immigration purposes. The jury in the criminal case considered whether the state had proven certain specific, charged acts of drug possession or distribution beyond a reasonable doubt, based on evidence admitted at trial. The Immigration Judge considered whether there is “reason to believe” that the respondent has been involved in trafficking, based on statements of informants gathered in the course of a law enforcement investigation. The Immigration Judge was required to consider whether the informants’ statements constitute evidence that is “““reasonable, substantial, and probative,” even though such statements may not have been admissible into evidence at a criminal trial.
 
The transcripts of the criminal trial include the testimony of three prosecution witnesses, all of whom testified that the respondent participated in his brother’s drug trade. See, e.g., Motion to Reopen, Tab A at 173-81, 297-98, 356. The motion to reopen focuses on the difficulties the prosecution faced in obtaining a conviction. The transcripts contain information that is significantly damaging to the respondent, however, when viewed from the standpoint of a civil matter in which the respondent must show that he warrants an extraordinary grant of discretionary relief. In considering the present motion, it appears to the Board that Attorney Litman’s decision not to offer the criminal trial transcripts at the hearing before the Immigration Judge may have been a reasonable strategic decision. We cannot say that the decision not to introduce the transcripts was egregious. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639 (noting that litigants are generally bound by the conduct of their attorneys, absent egregious circumstances). The motion fails to demonstrate egregious circumstances, or that the addition of the transcripts to the record before the Immigration Judge would change the outcome of the respondent’s case.
 
The Board concludes that ineffectiveness of counsel and prejudice have not been adequately demonstrated. We do not find that reopening of these proceedings has been shown to be warranted. See Matter of Coelho, supra, at 472-73. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
*3 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dominick S. Cardinale, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dara F. Reid
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; rescission
 
*1 On January 5, 2010, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal in absentia, and on February 23, 2011, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 11, 2010, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order. This case was last before the Board on August 30, 2011, when it denied the respondent’s untimely motion to reconsider its February 23, 2011, decision. On May 23, 2013, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
An alien may file only one motion to reopen and it must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); section 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i). An exception to the time and number restrictions exists for orders entered in absentia. See Maghradze v. Gonzales, 462 F.3d 150, 152 n. 1 (2d Cir. 2006); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i), 1003.23(b)(4). The exception provides that an order of removal entered in absentia may be rescinded upon the filing of a motion to reopen within 180 days after the date of the order of removal, if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, or upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive proper notice of the hearing.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may satisfy the exceptional circumstances requirement and may also serve to equitably toll the limitations period for filing a motion to reopen. See Twum v. I.N.S., 411 F.3d 54, 59 n. 4 (2d Cir. 2005); Iavorski v. I.N.S., 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir.2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (B.I.A.1988). However, “[f]or an untimely claim to receive the benefit of equitable tolling . . . an alien must demonstrate not only that the alien’s constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll.” Iavorski v. I.N.S., supra, at 135; see also Cekic v. I.N.S., 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting that “an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled”).
 
*2 The respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of his former attorney, Dominick Sorrentino, Esquire. He has not, however, shown that he has exercised due diligence in bringing this matter before the Board. See Cekic v. I.N.S., supra. The respondent claims that that “[c]ounsel failed to notify (him) of the date and time of . . . hearing” on January 5, 2010. Upon receipt of the Immigration Judge’s February 11, 2010, decision, however, the respondent was made aware that the Immigration Judge determined that he had received proper notice of the scheduled removal hearing, and that the illness which prevented Attorney Sorrentino from attending the hearing “did not relieve the respondent of attending the hearing in his own right.”1 See Immigration Judge’s February 11, 2010, Decision, at 2. Nevertheless, the respondent did not file the instant motion for more than 2 years after the Immigration Judge’s decision. Further, the respondent has not explained the delay in bringing this motion to reopen and rescind before the Board. Accordingly, equitable tolling of the motions filing period is not warranted in this case, and the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and rescind is denied.

IN RE: MELANIA ARROLIGA
File: AXXX XX7 254 - Miami, FL
July 19, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Juan C. Blanco, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Maria T. Armas
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Nicaragua, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of January 7, 2013. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia on December 8, 2010. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts.
 
The respondent alleges in her December 19, 2012, motion that she received ineffective assistance by Mr. Marlon Alberto Gonzalez, who represented to the respondent that he was an attorney. Specifically, the respondent maintains that Mr. Gonzalez told her not to appear for her December 8, 2010, hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion as numerically barred,1 and also noted that it was untimely filed.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “““exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996). Here, the respondent has partially complied with the Lozada requirements. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir. 2003) (a petitioner seeking to show ineffective assistance must meet each of the three screening requirements of Lozada, even where counsel’s ineffective assistance was clear on the record). We need not address whether the respondent adequately complied with the Lozada requirements or the Immigration Judge’s finding that the motion is numerically barred2 because the motion was properly found untimely.
 
Moreover, the respondent has not shown that she exercised due diligence. See Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 713 F.3d 1357, 1358 (11th 2013) (finding that equitable tolling generally requires litigant to show (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way). In her December 19, 2012, motion to reopen, the respondent indicates that she suspected “foul play” from Mr. Gonzalez at least by August 2011. Yet the respondent did not seek new counsel until July 2012, and the motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance by Mr. Gonzalez was not filed until December 19, 2012. Consequently, we find that the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by delaying over a year in raising the issue.
 
*2 We find that the respondent has not established an exceptional circumstance herein to warrant the sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). With regard to the respondent’s argument that the DHS should exercise its prosecutorial discretion, the decision of whether to exercise its prosecutorial discretion is a matter solely within the purview of the DHS, and neither the Immigration Judge, nor this Board, has jurisdiction to review such matter. See Matter of Bahta, 22 I&N Dec. 1381, 1392 (BIA 2000).
 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent on appeal maintains that she did not authorize Ms. Ima to file a motion, but the respondent has not indicated that an ineffective assistance of counsel complaint has been filed against Ms. Ima.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nita Dobroshi, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Randall Duncan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 On May 7, 2012, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States, and appeal was waived. See I.J. dec. at 2; Tr. at 8. Nevertheless, the respondent filed two Notices of Appeal forms through different counsel. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction on August 23, 2012, noting that the respondent did not assert or argue that the decision to waive appeal was not knowingly and intelligently made. We also observed that the respondent did not contend that he was provided with ineffective assistance of counsel at the hearing, nor had he demonstrated compliance with the threshold requirements for making such a claim. The respondent’s motion to reopen, alleging ineffective assistance by two prior attorneys in the waiver of the appeal and prior representation before the Board, was received on May 21, 2013. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The pending motion is untimely. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The United States Court of Appeals has held that equitable tolling of the time limit may be available in certain circumstances where there is ineffective assistance. See Ruiz-Turcios v. U.S. Att’y Gen., __ F.3d. __, 2013 WL 2262470 (11th Cir. 2013). In this case, the respondent claims ineffective assistance was provided by his former attorneys in conjunction with the waiver of appeal. However, the respondent has not shown substantial compliance with the requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Dakane v. United States Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005). Although the respondent has filed complaints against two attorneys with the Office of the General Counsel (OGC), he has not shown that he has filed any complaint against either attorney with the applicable state bar association. In addition, while each former attorney was notified that he filed an Immigration Practitioner Complaint form with the OGC, neither notification letter specified that the respondent was seeking reopening before the Board based on ineffective assistance allegations. Consequently, the respondent’s former attorneys were not made aware of the pending motion or their ability to respond to the allegations before the Board. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied. The Board’s May 24, 2013, order granting a stay of removal is vacated.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Charles M. Shepherd, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF SERVICE:
 
Marc A. Jones
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Peru, was ordered removed from the United States, following her failure to appear for a hearing on October 17, 2007. On December 2, 2009, she filed a motion to reopen pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). Her motion to reopen was granted on December 22, 2009, and her case was rescheduled for a new master calendar hearing. On August 18, 2010, the respondent and her attorney of record failed to appear. The Immigration Judge reinstated the original in absentia order of removal and directed the respondent’s removal to Peru based on the charges contained in the Notice to Appear (“NTA”). On September 1, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. In a decision dated October 3, 2011, the Immigration Judge denied reopening. This appeal follows. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of fact by an Immigration Judge only to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying reopening. The respondent does not dispute that she received the NTA on August 30, 2007, which contained the consequences for failing to appear at a scheduled removal hearing. She contends, however, that she never received notice of the August 18, 2010, hearing date and at no time did her attorney inform her that her matter had been set for that date. See December 2, 2009, Motion to Reopen. We have held, however, that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1995). When the court sent notice of the August 18, 2010, hearing date, it sent it to the respondent’s attorney of record, Mr. Solomon Gilliam.1 The respondent’s failure to appear for her hearing is not excused for lack of proper notice. While a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on a failure of counsel to inform his client of the time and date of the hearing can constitute exceptional circumstances, the respondent did not comply with the procedural requirements for making a proper ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Marinov v. Holder, 687 F.3d 365 (7th Cir. 2012); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth defined procedural requirements to prove a due process violation based on the performance of counsel). See also Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505 (BIA 1980) (the assertions of counsel do not constitute evidence). Further, contrary to the respondent’s contention on appeal, the Immigration Judge did not find that her prior counsel appeared at the August 18, 2010, hearing. Rather, he noted that counsel withdrew after that date.
 
*2 Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was before the Board on February 25, 2013, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s July 22, 2011, decision denying his application for adjustment of status. The respondent filed this motion to reopen his removal proceedings on May 24, 2013, to re-apply for adjustment of status. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The Board may consider a timely motion to reopen if the motion states the new facts that would be proven at a new hearing, and is supported by affidavits or other evidence that is material and was not available at the time of the prior hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). In Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1988), the Board explained that a party who seeks to reopen proceedings bears a “heavy burden” of proving that the new evidence would likely change the result in the case.
 
As the Board noted in the prior decision, adjustment of status is an extraordinary form of relief which was not designed to supersede the regular consular process of visa issuance abroad, and may be granted only where a favorable exercised of discretion is shown to be warranted. In this case, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent “has accumulated a lengthy criminal history since his arrival in the U.S.” and has “continually flouted the laws of the U.S.,” with a record that includes multiple convictions for the same and similar offenses. See I.J. at 6. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent failed to show that the positive equities in his case outweigh the negative factors. Id.
 
In support of reopening, the respondent offers voluminous evidence, including a psychological report dated May 2013 concerning his progress in rehabilitation and recovery from alcohol dependence. See Motion to Reopen, Tab R. The report itself is new but relies extensively on information existing previously. The respondent claims in his motion that this evidence and the other evidence now presented was not obtained and presented previously due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board held in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), that due process rights may be violated when ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from reasonably presenting his case. In order to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien must demonstrate that he was prejudiced.
 
*2 The Board concludes that the respondent received a full and fair hearing at which the Immigration Judge properly considered and evaluated his evidence (including the respondent’s claim to sobriety since 2005) and correctly determined the legal issues. The respondent’s continued progress toward rehabilitation and recovery is commendable. However, even considering the new evidence submitted with the motion and the entire record, the Board finds no basis for reopening and remanding the case for further proceedings. The respondent’s equities were weighed against the respondent’s lengthy criminal history. The respondent’s motion does not meet his “heavy burden” to show that proffered new evidence would likely change the result in his case. See Matter of Coelho, supra. Prejudice from the claimed ineffectiveness of counsel has not been shown. See Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
The Board concludes that the final removal order in this matter is not subject to reopening, and the respondent’s motion will be denied
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and motion for a stay are denied. All other pending motions in this matter are denied as moot.

APPLICATION: Reopening; remand; stay of removal
 
The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen her removal proceedings to challenge the removability charges under sections 237(a)(3)(D)(i) and (a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(3)(D)(i) and (a)(1)(A), and to have the Immigration Judge review the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ (“USCIS”) denial of her application for a hardship waiver under section 216(c)(4)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B). In our decision dated January 30, 2013, we dismissed her appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision which denied her motion to suppress and found her removable as charged above. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes her motion. The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen filed on April 29, 2013, is timely. She alleges ineffective assistance of former counsel (F. Woodside Wright). In Matter of Compean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General directed the Board to continue to apply the previously established standards for reviewing motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel (pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
The respondent meets the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to allege ineffective assistance of former counsel. She presents her declaration, counsel’s letter to Mr. Wright, and a copy of the complaint filed against Mr. Wright (Motion Exhs. at 55-89).
 
The respondent shows prejudice. See Lin v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir. 2004) (the court does not require that an alien’s representation be brilliant, but it cannot serve to make the immigration hearing so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case). She presents extensive evidence to support her contention that she entered into her first marriage in good faith (Motion Exhs. at 145-260). Mr. Wright, by not seeking review by the Immigration Judge of the USCIS’s denial of her second Form I-751 (application for a waiver under section 216(c)(4)(B) of the Act), prevented her from reasonably presenting her case. This may have affected the outcome of the case. See Correa-Rivera v. Holder, 706 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir. 2013) (the court will find prejudice when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings).
 
*2 The respondent also shows prejudice regarding the two removability charges she challenges. See Correa-Rivera v. Holder, supra. Section 237(a)(3)(D)(i) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that any alien who has falsely represented himself or herself to be a U.S. citizen for any purpose or benefit under this Act (including section 274A) or any Federal or State law is deportable. Section 212(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I), uses the same language except that the alien is “““inadmissible” instead of deportable. She presents evidence in support of her contention that stating that she was a U.S. citizen on her application for admission to the University of Nevada, Reno (Exhs. 2, 3), was not for any purpose or benefit under Nevada law (Motion Exhs. at 90-144). Mr. Wright did not present any evidence on this issue (other than in support of the motion to suppress). Her evidence may have affected the outcome of the case. We conclude that she shows prejudice under the standard in Correa-Rivera v. Holder, supra.1
 
Reopening and remand to the Immigration Judge are warranted because the respondent meets the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, and shows prejudice. Since her motion to reopen is timely filed, due diligence is not an issue. Because we will grant her motion, her stay request has been rendered moot.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: TOMAS VELAZQUEZ-RAMIREZ
File: AXXX XX6 644 - Charlotte, NC
June 20, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Yesenia Polanco, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Melissa K. Metz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
On April 19, 2011, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States in absentia, because he failed to appear for his hearing. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on May 9, 2011, but that request was denied on May 10, 2011. The respondent has appealed from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the respondent was served with the Notice to Appear on January 6, 2011, in person. His counsel was notified by regular mail of the April 19, 2011, removal hearing, on February 15, 2011, by regular mail. There is no support for the statement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in its brief that the notice was mailed to both the respondent and to his attorney. The motion to reopen maintained that the respondent did not receive notice of the hearing. The respondent’s attorney asked that proceedings be reopened and the respondent be given an opportunity to apply for cancellation of removal or that a continuance be granted for his wife to be naturalized. The respondent noted that he has an approved Form I-130 filed by his now United States citizen wife, and that he is eligible to apply for cancellation of removal and for voluntary departure, in the alternative.
 
As correctly indicated in the Immigration Judge’s decision, a Notice of Hearing sent to an alien’s attorney of record is considered constructive notice to the alien. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c), 1292.5; Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 258 (BIA 1985). The respondent did not raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel to establish “exceptional circumstances” for his failure to appear at the hearing. The respondent also did not comply with the procedural requirements for filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as enunciated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741 (4th Cir. 2006) finding no compliance with Lozada), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1182 (2007). Accordingly, that issue is not before us.
 
*2 On appeal the respondent filed an affidavit from his wife stating that no notice of the hearing date for her husband came to their house by mail and that she and their two United States citizen children would suffer hardship, if he is removed. The respondent submitted an affidavit stating that he did not receive notice of the court date. The respondent’s attorney maintains in her affidavit that she did not receive notice of the hearing and that the hearing was not listed on the court’s telephonic calendar. She states that the Immigration Judge notified her in a phone conversation on the day of the hearing that the respondent had not appeared for his hearing, and subsequently the Immigration Judge issued an in absentia order of removal. She also alleges that his wife has naturalized and he is eligible for adjustment of status through consular processing.
 
We presume that a properly addressed notice sent via regular mail is received by the addressee. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). The burden of proof for rebutting that presumption is weaker when items are sent by regular mail as opposed to certified mail. See Matter of M-R-A-, supra. According to the record, the respondent’s counsel was sent a notice of the hearing and that notice was not returned. The respondent’s attorney did not give an explanation of the circumstances which might lead to a failure to deliver the notice and which led to the in absentia hearing. The respondent also did not demonstrate that he is eligible for new relief which was not available at the time of the hearing. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). He does not allege and it does not appear that he can adjust his status in the United States, even though his wife is a United States citizen. Section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). See Hussain v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 153, 156-57 (4th Cir. 2007). Therefore, the Immigration Judge correctly denied the motion. The Board is not authorized to grant the respondent a stay of removal beyond the time necessary to reach a decision on the motion. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d), 1003.2(f).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

** THIS IS AN UNPUBLISHED DECISION - NOT INTENDED FOR CITATION AS PRECEDENT **

IN RE: MICHAEL MWANGI
File: AXXX XX1 886 - Buffalo, New York
June 19, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Olusegun Asekun, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brandi M. Lohr
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Kenya, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s February 7, 2013, written decision which denied his second motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief in opposition. The appeal will be dismissed.1
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues involving questions of law, judgment and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of her own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C).
 
The respondent received personal service on February 24, 2012, of the Notice to Appear which bears his signature (Exh. 1). After he was released from immigration custody, a copy of a hearing notice dated March 16, 2012, which scheduled his hearing for September 12, 2012, was mailed to him. He has conceded that he was aware of his September 12, 2012, hearing.
 
Following a hearing conducted in absentia on September 12, 2012, at which the respondent failed to appear, an Immigration Judge found him subject to removal as charged, determined that he had abandoned all potential applications for relief, and ordered him removed from the United States. See generally section 240 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. The in absentia removal order was mailed to the respondent and it was not returned by the postal service.
 
On October 5, 2012, the respondent, through attorney Sanjay Mathur, filed a motion to reopen which alleged that he had forgotten to appear on September 12, 2012, although his counsel had instructed him to appear unless a motion to change venue from Buffalo to Dallas, Texas had been granted. Attached to the motion was a signed and sworn 2-page affidavit from the respondent dated September 28, 2012, which indicated that he had consulted with Mr. Mathur in March 2012, that he formally retained him in August 2012, and that he forgot to appear for his hearing on September 12, 2012.
 
*2 On October 29, 2012, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen because the respondent’s failure to appear based on forgetting his hearing did not constitute an exceptional circumstance. He also declined to reopen the respondent’s case on his own authority. The respondent did not appeal this decision and it is now final.
 
On December 26, 2012, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a second motion to reopen. He now alleged that his previous attorney had falsely informed him that he had filed a motion to change venue. The respondent also submitted an affidavit dated December 16, 2012, in which he alleged that Mr. Mathur told him he had filed a motion to change venue. Respondent believed he did not need to appear in Buffalo on September 12, 2012. The respondent alleged that after he signed the affidavit on September 28, 2012, Mr. Mathur changed the text on the first page to indicate that Mr. Mathur had instructed him of the necessity of appearing on September 12, 2012, but that he failed to appear for his hearing because he had forgotten his attorney’s instructions. He attached a copy of a bar complaint he filed with state authorities on December 10, 2012, along with a copy of his retainer agreement with Mr. Mathur dated August 14, 2012.
 
The DHS filed a response in opposition, noting that it was the respondent’s second motion to reopen which was number barred, that he only filed a bar complaint after the denial of his first motion, and that he had not provided Mr. Mathur with an opportunity to respond to the bar complaint prior to filing the motion to reopen because he filed the motion very soon after filing the bar complaint.
 
On February 7, 2013, the Immigration Judge denied the second motion to reopen because the alleged ineffective assistance of his prior attorney was not newly discovered evidence insofar as it existed at the time the respondent filed the first motion, he failed to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his first motion, which meant that it was a final order, and he was limited to one motion to reopen.
 
We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision.2 The respondent has failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to establish ineffective assistance of counsel because he has not indicated whether a response has been received by Mr. Mathur or whether he has declined to respond. Furthermore, he conceded that he was aware of his obligation to attend the September 2012 hearing and he has not alleged in his second affidavit that Mr. Mathur told him not to attend the hearing. Therefore, he has not established ineffective assistance on this record.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
