IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maithe Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Manuel Ramirez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before us on June 23, 2016, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to terminate removal proceedings and ordering his removal from the United States. The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia, has submitted a second motion to reopen on August 15, 2019.1 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has submitted a brief opposing the respondent’s motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
For clarity, we provide a brief recitation of the undisputed facts and procedural history in this case. On April 3, 2015, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to terminate his removal proceedings, finding him inadmissible under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), because his Florida conviction for resisting an officer with violence is a crime involving moral turpitude. On October 30, 2015, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s second motion to terminate and ordered his removal from the United States to Colombia. On June 23, 2016, this Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision and dismissed the respondent’s appeal. Thereafter, the respondent filed a petition for review before the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, the controlling federal jurisdiction in this matter. On October 5, 2017, the Eleventh Circuit denied the respondent’s petition for review (see Respondent’s “Reply to DHS’ Opposition to the Respondent’s Motion to Reopen,” submitted on September 17, 2019, at Tab O).
 
On August 15, 2019, over 3 years after our decision, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen arguing that these proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of his prior counsel (see Respondent’s ““Corrected Motion to Reopen Removal Proceedings Based on Ineffective Assistance of Prior Counsel,” submitted on August 15, 2019, at 7-11 (“Motion to Reopen”)).
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely as it was filed over 3 years after the entry of the Board’s final administrative decision in this case. A party may file only one motion to reopen no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, it is well-settled that motions to reopen removal proceedings are disfavored and that reopening may properly be denied solely in the exercise of discretion. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 316 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988).
 
*2 In his motion to reopen, the respondent claims that he retained an attorney in December of 2017, for the purpose of reopening his proceedings, but his prior attorney made misrepresentations to him and never filed a motion on his behalf with this Board until almost 2 years later (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 7-9). The respondent further claims that although his prior attorney purportedly filed a motion to reopen with the Orlando Immigration Court, he failed to include evidence of the visa petition filed on his behalf by his United States citizen spouse (id. at 7-8).2
 
To establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, (1) the motion must be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent attesting to the relevant facts, (2) former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond, and (3) if the prior counsel’s conduct violated ethical or legal responsibilities, the motion should reflect whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988); see Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005) (confirming the applicability of these procedural requirements within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, wherein this case arises).
 
Although the respondent has submitted a copy of a grievance that was filed with the appropriate bar association against his former counsel, there is no evidence that the respondent provided his former attorney with an opportunity to respond to those allegations prior to filing the instant motion (see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at Exh. D).3 Significantly, the respondent has not established that his prior counsel’s conduct prejudiced him in any way, particularly since he has not shown a reasonable probability that his untimely4 motion to reopen would have been granted, but for his prior counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d at 1274. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the respondent has not established that reopening is warranted based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).
 
Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated a basis for the filing deadline to be equitably tolled See Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 713 F.3d 1357, 1363 n.5 (11th Cir. 2013) (stating that “equitable tolling requires a litigant to show (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way”) (internal quotations and citation omitted); see also Booth v. Carnival Corp., 522 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir. 2008) (stating that equitable tolling is an “‘extraordinary remedy’ that should be used sparingly, but courts may toll time limitations when an inequitable event prevents a party’s timely action”). Initially, we note that there is no evidence that the respondent took any action to seek reopening of his case until he was detained by the DHS in July of 2019 (see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 7 ¶ 21). Although the respondent claims that he retained the services of his prior attorney in 2017, and he was under the impression that his prior counsel filed a motion to reopen on his behalf, the respondent has not explained why he took no further action until 2019 when he was detained by the DHS (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 7 ¶ 26 and 9 ¶ 39). Thus, we conclude that the respondent has not demonstrated due diligence in pursuing his right to seek reopening such that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled. See Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 713 F.3d at 1363 n.5.
 
*3 Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the respondent has not shown that untimely reopening of these removal proceedings is warranted. We also conclude that the respondent has not shown exceptional circumstances that would warrant the favorable exercise of our sua sponte authority to reopen these proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to reopen sua sponte “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”).
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.
 
Linda S. Wendtland
FOR THE BOARD
Footnotes

1

The record reflects that the respondent’s prior counsel filed a motion to reopen with this Board on August 2, 2019. While that motion was pending, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen with the assistance of his present counsel.

2

We find the respondent’s argument unpersuasive, however, since his motion reflects that the visa petition was filed on August 7, 2019 (see Respondent’s ““Reply to DHS’ Opposition to the Respondent’s Motion to Reopen” at Tab L) - shortly before the instant motion was submitted - not in 2017 when the respondent married his United States citizen spouse or when his prior counsel purportedly filed his motion with the Immigration Court.

3

We also note that the respondent has not provided any additional information regarding the outcome of his bar complaint notwithstanding the passage of time during the pendency of this motion.

4

Notably, prior counsel’s motion would have been untimely even if he had not allegedly rendered ineffective assistance, since he was not hired until over a year after our entry of a final order of removal on June 23, 2016.

IN RE: KEVIN JOSUE ARRIAZA-RIVERA
File: AXXX-XX4-263 - Memphis, TN
January 28, 2020
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eric A. Henton, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s July 15, 2019, decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia after he did not appear for a hearing on January 21, 2015. The respondent argues that exceptional circumstances should excuse his failure to appear. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded only if the alien files a motion to reopen: (1) within 180 days after the date of the removal order in which he establishes that his failure to appear was because of “exceptional circumstances,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1); or (2) at any time in which he establishes that he did not have proper notice of the hearing at which the removal order was entered. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely (IJ at 2). A motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days of the failure to appear. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. The respondent’s motion was filed on June 3, 2019, and was thus untimely by nearly 4 years.
 
We disagree with the respondent’s argument that the deadline set forth in section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act should be equitably tolled based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Respondent’s Br. at 8-11. First, the respondent has not specified when an attorney was initially retained in his case and whether that attorney could thus be charged with contributing to the respondent’s inaction in filing a timely motion to reopen within the relevant 180-day period (IJ at 2). Further, the Immigration Judge correctly concluded that the respondent did not satisfy the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to document an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (IJ at 2-3). The respondent did not submit documentary evidence to show that the impugned attorney has been both informed of the ineffective assistance of counsel allegation and provided with an opportunity to respond to the allegation. See id. at 639. Written correspondence between the respondent and his former attorney that was submitted in support of the respondent’s motion to reopen pertains only to a request for the respondent’s file. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab H. With respect to additional steps required under Matter of Lozada, the respondent has neither submitted evidence of a disciplinary complaint filed against his former attorney nor explained why such a complaint has not been filed. See id. These requirements are intended to discourage baseless allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See id. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not established that the deadline for filing a motion to reopen should be tolled because it is not apparent that the impugned attorney was retained during the relevant period and because the requirements to document an ineffective assistance of counsel claim have not been fulfilled. Accordingly, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely.
 
*2 We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request that proceedings be reopened sua sponte (IJ at 3-4). The Immigration Judge’s authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1134 (BIA 1999). It is not intended as a general remedy for instances where a respondent has not complied with the applicable law and regulations. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). The respondent in this case had proper notice of the hearing at which he was ordered removed and did not seek the reopening of proceedings until more than 4 years later. We agree with the Immigration Judge that sua sponte reopening was not shown to be warranted in this case.
 
For the aforementioned reasons, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Diana R. Blank, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Amit Patel
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Indonesia, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s April 24, 2018, decision that denied his motion to reopen. The respondent has also requested remand. The Department of Homeland Security opposes reopening. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion will be denied.
 
The respondent does not dispute that his motion to reopen is untimely, but instead contends that he warrants equitable tolling of the time limits or sua sponte reopening and remand. On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion because 1) the respondent was deprived of due process and effective assistance of counsel at his National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) interview; 2) the respondent was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel at his immigration court proceedings; and 3) the respondent’s prima facie eligibility for a U visa is sufficient to merit reopening in the Immigration Judge’s discretion (Respondent’s Br. at 13-39). In his supplemental brief, the respondent further argues that the Immigration Judge did not have jurisdiction over his removal proceedings and that the Board should reopen sua sponte due to a recent change of law (Respondent’s Supp. Br. at 7-21). In his motion to remand, the respondent argues that the Board should remand to the Immigration Judge because Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has found the respondent prima facie eligible for a U visa and granted him deferred action status (Respondent’s Motion to Remand at 5-12).
 
The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not considering the due process violations at the respondent’s NSEERS examination (Respondent’s Br. at 14). The respondent argues that his prior counsel committed ineffective assistance of counsel in the NSEERS examination process, but the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by any potential ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Br. at 17-21). Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988) (requiring, inter alia, prejudice to sustain an ineffective assistance of counsel claim). Under the former NSEERS registration requirements, the respondent was obligated to provide certain information, including whether he was in compliance with his nonimmigrant visa, and the presence of counsel would not have changed that obligation. Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 427, 440 (2d Cir. 2008) (registrees have no right to remain silent or to refuse to provide information about immigration status). The respondent did not, and does not now, dispute that he overstayed his nonimmigrant visa without authorization and therefore was removable as charged in the Notice to Appear (NTA) (Exh. 1).
 
*2 Although the respondent argues that, had counsel who represented him at the NSEERS interview screened him for potential U visa eligibility, the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service may not have issued the respondent an NTA, the respondent’s argument is speculative (Respondent’s Br. at 19-20). Moreover, he does not indicate what prejudice he suffered because his NSEERS counsel did not timely turn over his file to his later counsel (Respondent’s Br. at 19-20). Therefore, the respondent has not established that any ineffective assistance of counsel at the NSEERS interview prejudiced him in his removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge. He also has not established that the interviewing officers’ failure to delay the interview to wait for the respondent’s attorney, who arrived late, constituted conscience-shocking conduct or a deprivation of fundamental rights (Respondent’s Br. at 19). Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d at 447 (holding that pre-hearing regulatory violations are not grounds for termination of immigration court proceedings, absent prejudice that may have affected the outcome of the proceeding, conscience-shocking conduct, or a deprivation of fundamental rights.)
 
The respondent further argues that his second attorney was ineffective during removal proceedings because she did not challenge the NTA and did not screen him for potential U visa eligibility (Respondent’s Br. at 21-30). We agree with the Immigration Judge, however, that the respondent has not established prejudice because he has not established that he was not removable as charged in the NTA or that he was eligible for any relief the Immigration Judge may grant. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1) (only the USCIS has jurisdiction over U visa petitions). 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.14(c)(ii), (c)(iv)(5)(i)(B) (outlining eligibility to apply for a U visa despite a removal order or from outside the United States).
 
In his appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge overlooked some of his claims and evidence in his motion to reopen (Respondent’s Br. at 11). Because the respondent has not established that he merits reopening for the reasons discussed above, we do not address these potential omissions.
 
In his supplemental brief, the respondent also argues that the NTA served on him was defective under the Supreme Court’s decision in Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018), because it did not include the time and place of his hearing and therefore the Immigration Judge did not have jurisdiction over his proceedings (Respondent’s Supp. Br. at 7-10). Since the respondent filed his brief, however, the Second Circuit and the Board have issued decisions regarding Immigration Court jurisdiction over proceedings begun by such defective NTAs. Banegas Gomez v. Barr, 922 F.3d 101, 110-111 (2d Cir. 2019) (“[W]e conclude that Pereira’s self-described disposition of this ‘narrow question,’... is not properly read to void jurisdiction in cases in which an NTA omits a hearing time or place.”); Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441 (BIA 2018) (holding that a notice to appear that does not specify the time and place of an alien’s initial removal hearing vests an Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over the removal proceedings and meets the requirements of section 239(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a), so long as a notice of hearing specifying this information is later sent to the alien). On May 30, 2003, the Immigration Court sent a notice of hearing which specified the time and place of his hearing. Therefore, the Immigration Judge properly had jurisdiction over the respondent’s 2003 removal proceedings.
 
*3 In his motion to remand, the respondent argues that the Board should remand proceedings because the USCIS has found him prima facie eligible for U visa status and has placed him in deferred action status due to the unavailability of U visas (Respondent’s Motion to Remand at 5-12). The respondent contends that reopening would “allow him to avail himself of the relief for which...he is eligible,” but does not indicate that he is eligible for any relief that the Immigration Judge can grant (Respondent’s Motion to Remand at 10). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.14(c)(1), (c)(iv)(5)(i) (outlining procedures for motions to reopen of respondents with final orders of removal who have been granted U visas by the USCIS). Until the respondent is granted a U visa, he remains removable and therefore the Immigration Judge cannot terminate proceedings. See Matter S-O-G- & F-D-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 462 (A.G. 2018). As the outcome of the proceedings will not change due to the approval of a U visa, the new evidence is not material. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(1), (c)(4) (motion to remand based on new evidence must be, inter alia, material). Accordingly, the respondent has not established eligibility for a motion to remand. See also Matter of L-V-K-, 22 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1999).
 
The respondent also argues that the Board should reopen the proceedings sua sponte (Respondent’s Supp. Br. at 20). We decline to do so, however, because, as discussed above, the respondent has not established eligibility for any relief the Immigration Judge may grant, and therefore has not established “a substantial likelihood that the result in his case would be changed if reconsideration or reopening is granted.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216, 1219 (BIA 2000).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered:
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: LEANA PATRICIA OLIVIA RENDEROS
File: AXXX-XX9-706 - New York, NY
January 23, 2020
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marisa-Andrea Moore, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; termination
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 23, 2018, that denied her motion to reopen proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under a clearly erroneous standard, and all other issue de novo. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The record reflects that the respondent was placed in removal proceedings by personal service of a Notice to Appear (NTA) on November 1, 2013 (Exh. 1). The NTA informed the respondent of the consequences of failing to appear for an immigration hearing and advised the respondent of her responsibility to keep the Immigration Court informed of her current address. The record reflects that the respondent provided an address in the Bronx, New York, and that she was released on her own recognizance pending an immigration hearing (Exh. 2).
 
The respondent alleges in an unsworn statement that she thereafter reported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in January 2014 (Respondent’s Mot. at Tab A). The respondent was informed that her next reporting date was in August 2014, but she claims that she somehow became confused and believed that she was required to report in October 2014. The respondent claims that she remained in contact with ICE through April 2014. The respondent claims that ICE gave her permission to relocate to an address in Nebraska, which she provided to an immigration officer. However, the respondent states that she did not move to that address because no one met her when she arrived in Nebraska. The respondent moved instead to an address resulting from a chance encounter with another woman from Honduras. The respondent indicates that after moving to Nebraska, she lost contact with the family at the Bronx address she had provided on her release from immigration detention. The respondent claims that she was in possession of an ICE document with an appointment scheduled for October 4, 2014, in Omaha, NE.1 However, the respondent did not keep the appointment because the person she had arranged to transport her to Omaha telephoned to cancel the trip. That person informed the respondent that she had contacted the appointment location directly and was told that a removal order had been entered against the respondent.
 
The respondent indicates that she took no steps to inform immigration authorities of her circumstances after learning of the removal order because she did not know whom to contact (Respondent’s Mot. at Tab A). The respondent states that she consulted various un-named attorneys about her situation. However, she did not hire anyone. The respondent argues that she was prevented from pursuing reopening in a timely manner because none of the attorneys she consulted advised her to file a motion for the purpose. The respondent filed the instant motion after accumulating funds to hire her current counsel.
 
*2 The respondent asserts on appeal that language barriers and a lack of education constitute exceptional circumstances that prevented her from reporting her change of address and appearing for her scheduled removal hearing (Respondent’s Br. at 6). See section 240(b)(4)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(4)(C) (providing for rescission of an in absentia order of removal within 180 days upon a showing of exceptional circumstances). The respondent argues that the 180 day time limit for filing a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances should be equitably tolled. She argues that informing ICE of her move to Nebraska, the respondent’s alleged intention to report for a scheduled appointment with immigration authorities in that state, and her alleged consultations with various attorneys about her situation demonstrates diligence in attempting to comply with her responsibilities in removal proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 5). Alternatively, the respondent argues that these proceedings should be terminated because the NTA served on her to commence the removal proceedings was defective (Respondent’s Br. at 7-15). The respondent also requests in the alternative that this Board exercise its sua sponte power to reopen and reinstate the proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 15).
 
The respondent’s motion to terminate is based on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018), holding that the NTA in that case, which did not designate a specific time or place of an alien’s hearing, was not a “Notice to Appear” under section 239(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a), for purposes of qualifying for cancellation of removal (Respondent’s Mot. at 1-3). The respondent argues that inasmuch the NTA in her case was similarly defective, because it did not specify a date and time for his initial hearing, the NTA could not confer jurisdiction over this matter on the Immigration Court. Therefore, the order of removal entered by the Immigration Judge is invalid, and the proceedings should be terminated.
 
The respondent is correct that the NTA issued to her does not specify the time or date on which her initial hearing would be held (Exh. 1). However, in Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441, 447 (BIA 2018), this Board held that a NTA that does not specify the time and place of an alien’s initial removal hearing will vest an Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over removal proceedings and meet the requirements of section 239(a) of the Act so long as a notice of hearing specifying that information is later sent to the alien. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reached the same conclusion in Benegas Gomez v. Barr, 922 F.3d 101, 110-11 (2d Cir. 2019) (rejecting jurisdictional argument for termination based on Pereira v. Sessions, and agreeing with the Board’s reasoning in Matter of Bermudez-Cota). There is no dispute that the respondent was issued a notice for her initial hearing, and constructive receipt is indicated because the notice was sent to the address of record for the respondent. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that termination of the removal proceedings is warranted.
 
*3 The Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen will be affirmed. The motion is untimely. As indicated above, the Immigration Judge correctly found that the respondent may be charged with constructive receipt of her hearing notice because it was sent to the last address she provided to the Immigration Court (IJ at 1-3). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated due diligence to equitably toll the 180 day time limit for filing a motion to rescind the in absentia order of removal in this case. The respondent took no action to inform immigration authorities of her whereabouts and explain the failure to report for her schedule hearing even after the respondent became aware that she had been ordered removed (IJ at 2). The Immigration Judge properly rejected the respondent’s attempt to blame her inaction on the various un-named attorneys she consulted because, aside from the lack compliance with the procedural requirements designed to insure the truthfulness of claims ineffective assistance, the respondent’s assertions in that regard lack sufficient detail to show that she reasonably relied on the advice of prior counsel to her detriment (IJ at 3). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (outlining the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (an alien asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate prejudice).
 
The respondent’s argument that a language barrier and lack of education constitute exceptional circumstances excusing compliance with her responsibility to keep the Immigration Court apprised of her current address is also unpersuasive. The NTA reflects that the respondent received advisals concerning her responsibility to inform the Immigration Court of a change of address and the consequences of a failure to appear at future proceedings. The respondent does not claim that those advisals were not communicated or explained to her. Moreover, the respondent concedes that she was aware that she was required to keep ICE similarly informed of any change of address, yet nevertheless failed to do so. Therefore, it is not clear that she would have complied in any event. Under the circumstances, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s actions and explanations appear to reflect “a casual unconcern” with her legal responsibilities in removal proceedings (IJ at 4). We affirm his determination that the respondent did not establish exceptional circumstances that would excuse her failure to appear.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen sua sponte will also be denied. The respondent has not presented exceptional circumstances to justify sua sponte reopening in the exercise of discretion, as she merely seeks to evade the regulatory requirements for rescission of the in absentia order of removal. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. at 984 (stating that the power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship).

ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nima M. Moshggoo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Termination
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s June 19, 2018, orders finding him removable, denying his motion to terminate proceedings, and ordering him removed to his native Ghana. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues involving questions of law, judgment and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to terminate proceedings. The respondent sought termination in order to have his Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, adjudicated by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). He reports, and has provided evidence showing, that a prior application for naturalization was denied on December 4, 2007, as he did not demonstrate the requisite good moral character for naturalization (Motion, Tab B). When he subsequently attempted to submit another application for naturalization, it was administratively closed on March 24, 2018, because he was in removal proceedings (Motion, Tab C).
 
In denying the respondent’s motion to terminate, the Immigration Judge found that no good cause had been shown (6/19/18 IJ Order). The respondent argues on appeal that his prior counsel failed to properly question the authority of the Immigration Services Officer to issue the Notice to Appear (Respondent’s Br., para. 12; Exh. 1). Although he asserts that he had ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has not complied with any of the requirements for reopening based on such a claim (Respondent’s Br. at 16-18). Twum v. INS, 411 F.3d 54 (2d Cir. 2005); see also Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005) (stating that a respondent who fails to comply substantially with the Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) requirements for reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel “forfeits” his claim). Therefore, reopening or termination in this regard is not appropriate.
 
The respondent did not identify any basis upon which termination of the proceedings was warranted. He neither challenged the validity of the factual allegations contained in the Notice to Appear, nor the charges of removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act (Exh. 1).
 
Furthermore, the respondent’s desire to challenge the denial of his original naturalization application, and/or the administrative closure of his second application, without more, is not a basis for termination of the proceedings. Rather, he has not shown that he is eligible for naturalization as he has not addressed the determination that he did not satisfy the good moral character requirement. Sections 101(f)(8), 316(a)(3) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 329(d); see also Matter of Castillo-Perez, 27 I&N Dec. 664, 666 (BIA 2019). Furthermore, removal proceedings may only be terminated pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1239.2(f) where the Department of Homeland Security has presented an affirmative communication attesting to an alien’s prima facie eligibility for naturalization. See, e.g., Matter of Acosta-Hidalgo, 24 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2007). No such attestation is of record.
 
*2 The respondent’s motion may also be viewed as being in the nature of a request for adjournment of the proceedings. In this regard, we note that the Immigration Judge properly found he did not present good cause for such a request. See Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 790-92 (BIA 2009) (setting forth factors to consider in determining whether good cause exists for a continuance to await adjudication of a pending visa petition, including prima facie eligibility for adjustment); see also Matter of L-A-B-R- et al, 27 I&N Dec. 405, 407 (A.G. 2018) (stating that continuances may only be granted upon a showing of good cause); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6.
 
Since the respondent did not demonstrate good cause for either termination or adjournment of the proceedings, the Immigration Judge properly denied his motion to terminate. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jodi M. Goodwin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Francisco J. Muniz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the July 24, 2018, decision of the Immigration Judge denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on December 3, 1999, as an inadmissible returning resident who was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. See sections 101(a)(13)(C)(v), 212(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), 1182(a)(2)(A)(i). His removal order was effectuated the next day and, according to the respondent, he returned to the United States the same month (Respondent’s Br. at 4; Motion to Reopen at 63).1
 
An alien seeking to reopen his removal proceedings must file a motion within 90 days of the date of his administratively final order of removal.2 Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). The respondent does not argue that the instant motion was filed within 90 days of his removal order becoming final but rather argues that the deadline should be equitably tolled because (1) the Immigration Judge who presided over his 1999 removal proceedings misapplied the law by determining that his conviction was an aggravated felony, thus rendering him ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a); and (2) he obtained incorrect advice from a series of attorneys over the years since his removal (Respondent’s Br. at 5-10).3 An alien seeking reopening past the 90-day deadline is entitled to equitable tolling if he establishes “(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.” Lugo-Resendenz v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016).
 
Here, we discern no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that equitable tolling does not apply because the respondent has not identified any extraordinary circumstances that prevented him from filing a timely motion to reopen (IJ at 2). See Penalva v. Sessions, 884 F.3d 521, 525 (5th Cir. 2018) (“[W]hether equitable tolling applies to a [respondent’s] motion to reopen is a question of fact.”) (quoting Dominguez v. Sessions, 708 F. App’x 808, 812 (5th Cir. 2017)); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Specifically, the respondent does not persuasively explain how the Immigration Judge’s conduct during the removal proceedings “stood in his way and prevented” him from filing a motion to reopen within 90 days after the proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 6-8). Lugo-Resendenz v. Lynch, 831 F.3d at 344. He has also not presented any evidence showing that he sought legal advice within the 90-day period following the entry of his removal order (Motion to Reopen at 63). Therefore, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen on the basis that it was untimely (IJ at 2).
 
*2 In addition, the prior Immigration Judge’s legal conclusion that the respondent’s conviction was an aggravated felony, which would make him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal, did not render the proceedings fundamentally unfair. The respondent did not meaningfully contest that he was removable as charged in the Notice to Appear (NTA) before the Immigration Judge, nor did he pursue his right to appeal, and “because an alien’s eligibility for discretionary relief from removal [such as cancellation] is not a liberty or property interest deserving of due process protection, an IJ’s failure to explain the eligibility for such relief does not rise to the level of fundamental unfairness.” United States v. Cordova-Soto, 804 F.3d 714, 723 (5th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation omitted); see also Miresles-Zuniga v. Holder, 743 F.3d 110, 112 (5th Cir. 2014) (noting that cancellation of removal is a discretionary form of relief).
 
The respondent also has not identified any newly submitted material evidence that was “not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104 (1988) (A motion to reopen may be denied if “the movant has not introduced previously unavailable, material evidence.”). Specifically, the respondent has not explained how (1) his conviction record dated May 13, 1996, (2) evidence of continuous physical presence prior to 1996, and (3) evidence of positive equites prior to service of the NTA were unavailable during his 1999 removal proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 11). Thus, we also affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision on the basis that the motion does not allege any new facts to be proven (IJ at 2).
 
Because we affirm the decision below on the foregoing bases, we need not address the respondent’s arguments regarding the Immigration Judge’s exercise of discretion (IJ at 2; Respondent’s Br. at 11-13).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The facts in the record do not conclusively establish the manner in which the respondent reentered the United States. However, if he reentered without first obtaining permission from the Attorney General to apply for admission, he would be subject to reinstatement of his prior removal order under section 241(a)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5), and ineligible for reopening or any form of relief. See Martinez v. Johnson, 740 F.3d 1040, 1043 (5th Cir. 2014); Anderson v. Napolitano, 611 F.3d 275, 278-79 (5th Cir. 2010).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey B. Rubin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In an April 12, 2018, decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent appeals from that decision and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not file a brief in reply to the respondent’s appeal.1 The respondent additionally requests termination of proceedings. The request will be denied, and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent argues that proceedings should be terminated for lack of jurisdiction (Respondent’s Br. at 1, 4-6); we disagree. A notice to appear (NTA) that does not specify the time and place of the alien’s initial removal hearing vests an Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over the removal proceedings when a notice of hearing specifying that information is later sent to the alien. Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441, 445-47 (BIA 2018); see Goncalves Pontes v. Barr, 938 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2019). The NTA served on the respondent did not list the date and time of his initial removal proceeding, but the notice of hearing served on him one month later provided the missing information (Exh. 1; Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings, June 10, 2010). Thus, the respondent’s jurisdictional argument is unavailing because the NTA, coupled with the notice of hearing, vested the Immigration Judge with jurisdiction. Therefore, we will deny the respondent’s request for termination of proceedings.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely (Respondent’s Br. at 6; DHS’s Opposition to Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 1). See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). However, the respondent advances two arguments to show his motion warrants the “‘rare remedy”D’ of equitable tolling. See Neves v. Holder, 613 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 2010) (quoting Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 396 (2007)). To prevail in this regard, the respondent must show “extraordinary circumstances” prevented him from complying with the statutory deadline and that he “diligently pursued his rights the entire period he seeks equitably tolled.” See id. (citing Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir. 2000)); see also Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 649 (2010). The respondent’s first argument, that a serious illness prevented him from attending his final hearing, is of little benefit because the record indicates that the respondent was hospitalized for 1 day--over 7 years before he filed the motion to reopen notifying the Immigration Court of the reason for his absence (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 4-6, 12, 37-40). See Guerrero-Santana v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 90, 94 (1st Cir. 2007) (“The doctrine is not available as a means of rescuing a party who has failed to exercise due diligence.”).
 
*2 The respondent’s second argument--that his attorney provided ineffective assistance2 by stating that he had no relief available following the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order (see Respondent’s Br. at 7; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 4-7, 13)--is unpersuasive as it is unaccompanied by compliance with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Ferreira v. Ban, 939 F.3d 44, 45-46 (1st Cir. 2019). “[T]he Lozada requirements are designed to give the BIA sufficient information to inform its decision without resorting to an evidentiary hearing.” Id at 46. Absent such an evidentiary basis, we decline to conclude that the respondent’s former counsel provided ineffective assistance--particularly when the respondent had years to gather evidence in support of his claim. See Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 9, 11-13 (1st Cir. 2004). Therefore, the respondent’s motion was untimely filed and did not warrant equitable tolling of the statutory deadline.
 
Furthermore, the respondent has not demonstrated that the particular circumstances of this case presents an “exceptional situation” that warrants the exercise of sua sponte authority to reopen these proceedings as a matter of discretion. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (“[A]s a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”) (citing Matter of J-J-, 22 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997))). We note that many aliens who have been present in the United States for a period of years have accumulated favorable equities subsequent to being ordered removed and generally these are not so exceptional as to warrant reopening sua sponte. See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216, 1218 (BIA 2000) (“[I]t is the respondent’s burden to demonstrate that such a situation exists.”). In the present case, upon consideration of the record, including the respondent’s arguments of eligibility for adjustment of status relief and his family ties in the United States (Respondent’s Br. at 7-8), we conclude that sua sponte reopening is not warranted. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

We construe the respondent’s position that “his attorney gave him the wrong advice” as an assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel in this context, because a less serious, “‘garden variety claim of excusable neglect”D’ would not warrant equitable tolling.

BEFORE: Board Panel: MALPHRUS, MULLANE, and CREPPY, Board Members
MALPHRUS, Board Member:
In a decision dated November 2, 2017, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s applications for asylum and withholding of removal under sections 208(b)(1)(A) and 241(b)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(1)(A) and 1231(b)(3)(A) (2012), and his request for protection under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted and opened for signature Dec. 10, 1984, G.A. Res. 39/46, 39 U.N. GAOR Supp. No. 51, at 197, U.N. Doc. A/RES/39/708 (1984) (entered into force June 26, 1987; for the United States Apr. 18, 1988) (“Convention Against Torture” or “Convention”). The respondent has appealed from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
  
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Guatemala who entered the United States on April 24, 2016, without a valid entry document. He was *710 subsequently placed in removal proceedings where, through counsel, he conceded removability and filed applications for relief from removal.
 
The respondent’s persecution claim stems from an incident in Guatemala in 2016. He testified that he worked for 12 years as a salesman for a beverage distributor in Guatemala. In 2015, the respondent and six other employees were laid off, and he received a severance package of 167,000 quetzales (approximately $21,500). He used 70,000 quetzales to purchase land and cattle, and he went into the cattle business.
 
In the middle of 2015, a family member warned the respondent to be careful, telling him that a number of police cars had been spotted around his house. On March 13, 2016, the respondent received a phone call from an unknown person who asked him for 120,000 quetzales, stating that he knew the respondent had money. When the respondent said he had no money, the caller said, “Yes. We know you do.” The caller told the respondent he must pay, or he and his associates would kill the respondent’s family.
 
**2 Two weeks later, on March 31, 2016, five men wearing shirts with the insignia of the Policia Nacional Civil (“PNC”), Guatemala’s national police, appeared at the respondent’s door carrying high-caliber firearms. The respondent opened the front door part way, and the men pushed the door open and hit the respondent in the left shoulder with a gun, causing his shoulder to dislocate. The men also handcuffed the respondent and began trashing his house, looking for money. They threatened to cut off the respondent’s fingers if he did not pay them.
 
The respondent told the men that he had 10,000 quetzales in his car, which one of them retrieved. After he returned to the house with the money, another of the men received a phone call indicating that a neighbor had contacted the police to report a disturbance at the respondent’s house and that the police were en route. At that point, the men removed the handcuffs from the respondent and told him that he had 10 days to pay the balance of the amount they demanded, or he would be killed. One man threatened to take out the respondent’s good eye if he reported them to the police.1 The respondent did not report the incident to the police. He also did not see a doctor for his shoulder injury but was, instead, treated by a layperson.
 
The respondent left Guatemala, entered the United States on April 24, 2016, and filed an application for asylum on September 5, 2017. After an individual hearing, the Immigration Judge issued a decision pretermitting the respondent’s asylum application as time-barred. The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s application for withholding of removal, finding that he failed to establish that it was more likely than not he would face persecution on account of a protected ground and that the Government of Guatemala was unwilling or unable to protect him from his attackers.
 
*711 As to the respondent’s claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture, the Immigration Judge held that the respondent did not establish that the five men who beat, robbed, and threatened him were bona fide police officers. In the alternative, the Immigration Judge held that even if they actually were police officers, the respondent did not establish that the men acted in an official capacity, as opposed to acting for personal gain, or that they acted with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. For these reasons, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture. On appeal, the respondent contends that he has met his burden of proving that he is eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.
  
II. ANALYSIS
 
The primary issue in this case concerns whether the men who harmed the respondent were acting “in an official capacity,” that is, “under color of law” or were, instead, “rogue officials.” To resolve this issue, we must look to the language of both the Convention Against Torture and the implementing legislation and regulations. See generally INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 414 (1984) (beginning the analysis of the case by examining the relevant “sources of law”). We begin our analysis with the history and language of the Convention.
  
A. Convention Against Torture
 
**3 The United Nations Convention Against Torture was adopted by unanimous agreement of the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1984, and was entered into force on June 26, 1987.2 It established “a regime for international cooperation in the criminal prosecution of torturers, relying on the principle of ‘universal jurisdiction’ and the obligation to extradite or prosecute.” S. Exec. Rep. No. 101-30, at 2 (1990).
 
*712 Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture defines “torture” to mean
any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.
 
(Emphasis added). According to Article 3 of the Convention,
No State Party shall expel, return (“refouler”) or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.
 
 
The United States signed the Convention Against Torture on April 18, 1988, and the President transmitted it to the Senate on May 20, 1988, with several proposed conditions. In transmitting the document, the President observed that ““the Convention applies only to torture that occurs in the context of governmental authority, excluding torture that occurs as a wholly private act or, in terms more familiar in United States law, it applies to torture inflicted under color of law.” Message from the President of the United States Transmitting the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100-20, at 4 (1988) (emphases added). After the Convention was resubmitted to the Senate with revised conditions in 1990, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations passed a resolution of ratification for the advice and consent of the Senate. The accompanying report specifically stated that “acts of torture committed by private individuals are excluded.” S. Exec. Rep. No. 101-30, at 6. These documents are critical to understanding our nation’s obligations under the Convention and how we should determine what conduct is covered by it.
 
To implement the Convention domestically, Congress enacted section 2242 of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Division G of Pub. L. No. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822 (codified as a note to 8 U.S.C. § 1231), which provides that “the heads of the appropriate agencies shall prescribe regulations to implement the obligations of the United States under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture.” Id. § 2242(b).
 
**4 The United States Department of Justice promulgated an interim rule to implement the obligations of the United States under Article 3 in the context of removal of aliens. *713 Regulations Concerning the Convention Against Torture, 64 Fed. Reg. 8478 (Feb. 19, 1999). The rule created two separate provisions for protection under Article 3. Id. at 8489-90. The first provision established withholding of removal under the Convention for aliens who are not subject to the bars to eligibility in section 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c) (2000). The second, called “deferral of removal,” provided protection for aliens who are ineligible for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3)(B). See 8 C.F.R. § 208.17(a) (2000). The rule defined ““torture” with respect to both withholding of removal and deferral of removal, incorporating the provision in Article 1 of the Convention that torture must be “inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.” 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1) (2000).
 
The regulations governing claims raised in removal proceedings for protection under the Convention Against Torture are currently at 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c) through § 1208.18 (2019).3 Under 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1), the Convention extends to acts of torture that have been “inflicted by . . . a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.” (Emphasis added.) The regulation, like the treaty, envisions that torture could be inflicted by a government official who is acting outside the rubric of the Convention, that is, in a personal capacity. The history and purpose of the treaty reflect that its protection was intended to apply only to torture that occurs in the context of governmental authority.
 
There is no indication that the Department of Justice intended to exceed the intent of the drafters of the treaty when the regulation was promulgated. Thus, under the treaty and its implementing regulation, torturous conduct committed by a public official who is acting “in an official capacity,” that is, “under color of law” is covered by the Convention Against Torture, but such conduct by an official who is not acting in an official capacity, also known as a “rogue official,” is not covered by the Convention.4 “Rogue officers” or *714 “rogue officials” are public officials who act outside of their official capacity, or, in other words, not under color of law.
  
1. Under Color of Law
 
**5 Although the regulations do not define the term acting “in an official capacity,” the Attorney General has interpreted the phrase to mean “under color of law.” Matter of Y-L-, A-G- & R-S-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 270, 285 (A.G. 2002) (“The scope of the Convention is confined to torture that is inflicted under color of law.” (citing Ali v. Reno, 237 F.3d 591, 597 (6th Cir. 2001)));5 see also United States v. Belfast, 611 F.3d 783, 808 (11th Cir. 2010) (noting that “there is no distinction between the meaning of the phrases “under the color of law’ and ‘in an official capacity”D’).
 
Giving deference to the Attorney General’s determination that acting “in an official capacity” means “under color of law,” two Federal courts of appeals have drawn from their own interpretation of that phrase in civil rights *715 case law to apply it in the immigration context. Ramirez-Peyro v. Holder, 574 F.3d 893, 900 (8th Cir. 2009) (“While our circuit has yet to adopt the agency’s interpretation of ‘in an official capacity’ as the equivalent of “under color of law’ as used in the civil-rights context as reasonable, we do so now.”); see also Garcia v. Holder, 756 F.3d 885, 891 (5th Cir. 2014) (stating that under the Attorney General’s standard, “we interpret under color of law as we would in a civil rights case”). We will follow that approach in analyzing a claim involving conduct by a public official who is not acting in an official capacity, that is, a “rogue official.”
 
We apply the law through case-by-case adjudication in removal proceedings under the Act, and in so doing, we have an obligation to promote consistency in the application of the immigration laws through Board precedent. See Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 248-49 (BIA 2014) (noting the role of Board precedent in defining the United States’ obligations under international agreements and in establishing that claims relying on those agreements are adjudicated with consistency in removal proceedings). See generally Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-603, § 115(1), 100 Stat. 3359, 3384 (stating Congress’ intent that “the immigration laws of the United States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly”). While no one case and no one circuit’s law is dispositive, we set forth a national standard based on the general import of civil rights law as relevant in the immigration context. See INS v. Orlando Ventura, 537 U.S. 12, 16-17 (2002) (per curiam) (recognizing the importance of allowing the Board to “make an initial determination” so that it “can bring its expertise to bear” on matters that arise in the immigration context).
 
**6 In the civil rights context, a public official “acts under color of law when he misuses power possessed by virtue of . . . law and made possible only because he was clothed with the authority of . . . law.” Ramirez-Peyro, 574 F.3d at 900 (alterations in original) (citations omitted). An act that is motivated by personal objectives is under color of law when an official uses his official authority to fulfill his personal objectives. Garcia, 756 F.3d at 892. “The dispositive question is whether the [official] was exercising the power [he or] she possessed based on state authority or was acting only as a private individual.” Butler v. Sheriff of Palm Beach County, 685 F.3d 1261, 1265 (11th Cir. 2012). In other words, in determining if a public official who engaged in torture was “acting in an official capacity,” it is key to consider if he was only able to accomplish the acts of torture by virtue of his official status. See United States v. Tarpley, 945 F.2d 806, 809 (5th Cir. 1991).
 
In evaluating if a public official is acting under color of law in inflicting torture, circuit courts have significantly relied on whether government connections provided the officer access to the victim, or to his whereabouts or other identifying information. For example, the United States Court of *716 Appeals for the Fifth Circuit determined in an extortion case that the offenders’ ability to obtain information about the victim’s whereabouts and his financial status from other public officials who had acquired that information in their official capacities was a strong indication that the offenders were acting in their official capacity. Garcia, 756 F.3d at 892-93. Two extortion attempts and threats to the victim in that case occurred shortly after he had provided required information to government officials: first, when he applied for a national identity card, and second, when he was stopped and questioned at a police checkpoint. Id.; see also Ramirez-Peyro, 574 F.3d 905-06 (remanding based on evidence that Mexican Government officials who, in their official capacity, obtained information about the victim’s identity and whereabouts could provide that information to drug cartels who would torture and kill the victim); United States v. Picklo, 190 F. App’x 887, 889 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (holding that a government official who robbed a person “acted under color of law because he identified himself as a state investigator, flashed a badge, and used his official status to get [the victim] to follow his instructions”). In these cases, the person’s official capacity effectively provided the means to access, locate, or harm the victim.
 
**7 In contrast, in Miah v. Mukasey, 519 F.3d 784, 788 (8th Cir. 2008), the Eighth Circuit approved of our conclusion that an elected official who attempted to take control of other people’s property was a “rogue” official because his actions fell outside of his official duties. In determining that the official was not acting in an official capacity, we noted that other government officials did not assist him but, instead, made an effort to investigate and prosecute him criminally for his illegal activities.
 
Also relevant to the analysis is whether a law enforcement officer was on duty and in his official uniform at the time of his conduct. If so, it is more likely that he acted under color of law. However, the use of an official uniform or service weapon is not dispositive of the issue, because those items can be obtained outside the normal channels of government operations, and they may not be necessary to the official’s ability to engage in the torturous conduct. See Barna v. City of Perth Amboy, 42 F.3d 809, 816-19 (3d Cir. 1994) (holding that a police officer did not act under color of law, even though he was in uniform and used a government-issued nightstick to beat the victim, because he was off-duty and outside his jurisdiction, and he did not encounter the victim as part of police business); see also Ramirez-Peyro, 574 F.3d at 901; Vargas Hidalgo v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 154 F. App’x 827, 829 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam). Moreover, in general, the higher a position in law enforcement that a person holds, the more likely his conduct will be under color of law, even if his actions are taken for personal gain. He is in a *717 position to more easily abuse his authority without adverse consequences than, for example, a line police officer.
 
A similar consideration is whether the officer threatened to retaliate through official channels if the victim reported his conduct to authorities. See Tarpley, 945 F.2d at 809 (holding that an assault by a police officer was under color of law where he repeatedly told the victim that, because he was an officer, he could beat and even kill the man without any consequences). In this regard, the Seventh Circuit held that, even though an officer attacked an inmate for personal reasons, he acted under color of law where he was on duty and in uniform at the time of the attack and enlisted the aid of other officers in the jail. United States v. Christian, 342 F.3d 744, 751-52 (7th Cir. 2003). This case reflects that consideration should be given to whether a government official is acting to fulfill purely personal objectives, but it is not dispositive of the rogue official question. By contrast, in Almand v. DeKalb County, 103 F.3d 1510, 1515 (11th Cir. 1997), the Eleventh Circuit determined that an officer’s conduct in breaking down an apartment door and raping a woman occupant while he was in uniform was not under color of law since there was no evidence that he accomplished the act because of the power he possessed under State authority. It was, instead, an act that any “ruffian” could have done. Id.
 
**8 It has been held that the use of government-issued equipment, such as a service weapon or handcuffs, to beat or restrain a victim does not automatically render the conduct under color of law. Rather, an Immigration Judge should consider whether a private citizen could obtain the same weapons or restrain the victim in the same manner. For example, in Butler, 685 F.3d at 1267-69, the court found that the officer’s use of her government-issued handgun and handcuffs on the victim did not mean that she acted under color of law, because someone who is not a law enforcement officer could also own a handgun and handcuffs and use them to restrain another person.
 
Whether a public official’s actions are under color of law is a fact-intensive inquiry, and an Immigration Judge should assess both the direct and circumstantial evidence to make this determination. When making factual findings regarding a public official’s conduct, the Immigration Judge should not rely on unproven assumptions to find that the official acted under color of law. In this regard, the First Circuit affirmed our holding that a police officer did not act under color of law when he repeatedly visited the applicant’s mother with other officers in uniform and asked for her daughter’s whereabouts. Costa v. Holder, 733 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2013). The court also noted the government’s on-going efforts to combat police corruption. It concluded that the direct and circumstantial evidence was too limited to draw the inference that the officers relied on their status as law *718 enforcement officers to threaten the mother, stating that any contrary determination would be an “unproven assumption[].” Id.
 
In sum, the key consideration in determining if a public official was acting under color of law is whether he was able to engage in torturous conduct because of his government position or if he could have done so without any connection to the government. Issues to consider in making this determination include whether government connections provided the officer access to the victim, or to his whereabouts or other identifying information; whether the officer was on duty and in uniform at the time of his conduct; and whether the officer threatened to retaliate through official channels if the victim reported his conduct to authorities.
  
2. Acquiescence
 
Even if a public official has engaged in torture in a private capacity, and therefore not under color of law, an alien may nevertheless qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture if he demonstrates that a public official or other person acting in an official capacity consented to or acquiesced in the torture. Khouzam v. Ashcroft, 361 F.3d 161, 171 (2d Cir. 2004). Acquiescence requires that “the public official, prior to the activity constituting torture, have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(7); see also Silva-Rengifo v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 473 F.3d 58, 67-70 (3d Cir. 2007) (stating that acquiescence includes both actual knowledge and willful blindness); Chen v. Gonzales, 470 F.3d 1131, 1141 (5th Cir. 2006) (same); Amir v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 921, 927 (6th Cir. 2006) (same); Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 369 F.3d 1239, 1242-43 (11th Cir. 2004); Khouzam, 361 F.3d at 171.
 
**9 An applicant may establish acquiescence by citing to evidence, particularly country conditions evidence, showing that the torturous conduct is “routine” and sufficiently connected to the criminal justice system for an adjudicator to reasonably infer that higher-level officials either know of the torture or remain willfully blind to it and therefore breach their legal responsibility to prevent it. Khouzam, 361 F.3d at 171.
  
3. Application to the Respondent
 
The Immigration Judge made alternative holdings to support his denial of the respondent’s claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture. First, he held that the respondent did not meet his burden of proving that the five men who beat, robbed, and threatened him were police officers. A private person who has no actual political or government affiliation is not a *719 “rogue official,” even if he purports to be a government official. For example, an individual who impersonates a police officer by flashing a fake badge is not a rogue official because that person is not a “public official” in the first place, let alone one acting under color of law, as required by the Convention and 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1).
 
The fact that the men wore shirts bearing the insignia of a government law enforcement agency and carried high-caliber weapons and handcuffs did not prove that they were actually police officers. As the Immigration Judge noted, the shirts could have been fake, and it is not unusual to expect a criminal to carry a weapon. Further, the men did not arrive at the respondent’s home in police vehicles, and their immediate departure after learning that an official police car was en route to investigate the disturbance is a further indication that they were not bona fide police officers. The Immigration Judge’s determination was a permissible view of the evidence, and there is no clear error in his findings in this regard.
 
In the alternative, the Immigration Judge held that, even if the men were police officers, the respondent did not establish that they were acting in an official capacity. He found, instead, that they were acting as rogue officials for personal gain.6 On appeal, the respondent primarily focuses on this alternative holding, which requires us to determine when a public official acts “under color of law” and thus triggers the protections of the Convention Against Torture. He claims that the facts of his case “strongly suggest” that the men who attacked him had access to him through official police channels. Even if they were police officers, this unproven assumption is insufficient to carry his burden to show that the men were acting under color of law at the time of the attack.
 
The evidence does not support the conclusion that a government position gave the men special access to the respondent’s house or to his private information, including the fact that he had been awarded a significant amount of money and kept the cash at his house. Although the respondent received a threatening phone call prior to the incident indicating that the caller and his associates knew he had money at the house, there is no evidence that the caller was a police officer or was associated in any way with the Guatemalan Government.
 
**10 Further, the men left immediately after learning that an official police car was en route to the respondent’s house to investigate the disturbance. They also threatened to take the respondent’s other eye out if he reported the incident to the police, raising further doubt that they were acting with government authority. See  *720 Suarez-Valenzuela, 714 F.3d 241, 248 (4th Cir. 2013) (finding no acquiescence where an officer tortured the applicant to keep him from testifying against the officer, thus evidencing that the officer feared official repercussions for his actions). The Immigration Judge reasoned that the men were concerned that they could be discovered by the police. He concluded that they would not have reacted in this manner if they thought they could act with impunity and had no reason to fear adverse consequences if their conduct was discovered by law-abiding officers. This was a permissible view of the evidence. See id.
 
Moreover, the fact that the men carried high-caliber weapons and handcuffs does not automatically place their conduct under “color of law” because, as the Immigration Judge explained, it is reasonable to expect that persons engaged in the criminal act of threatening and robbing others would carry weapons. See Butler, 685 F.3d at 1267.
 
Finally, it is significant that the respondent did not report the incident to the police. As a result, there is no way to evaluate whether the police would have investigated the incident and taken action against any of the attackers. See Joaquin-Porras v. Gonzales, 435 F.3d 172, 175, 181 (2d Cir. 2006) (upholding an Immigration Judge’s finding that a police officer’s rape of the alien, who did not report the incident to official authorities, was “an isolated attack by a corrupt official”); cf. Barajas-Romero v. Lynch, 846 F.3d 351, 355 (9th Cir. 2017) (noting that a local police officer refused to investigate an attack after the alien stated that the officer’s colleagues were responsible). It is not sufficient to simply assume that the police would not have responded. See Almutairi v. Holder, 722 F.3d 996, 1003 (7th Cir. 2013) (stating that “because [the alien] never mentioned the threatening calls to anyone in the Kuwaiti police or military, he could only speculate that the Kuwaiti government might not protect him if he did seek its help”). For all the above reasons, we conclude that even if the men were bona fide police officers, the Immigration Judge properly determined that they were not acting under color of law.7 We therefore concur with his denial of the respondent’s claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture.
  
B. Asylum and Withholding of Removal Under the Act
 
**11 The Immigration Judge also properly denied the respondent’s claim for asylum as time-barred because he did not file his application within 1 year of his arrival date. Section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Act. The respondent entered the United States on April 24, 2016, but did not file his asylum application until September 5, 2017. He did not identify, much less demonstrate, any *721 changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the late filing. See section 208(a)(2)(D) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(4)-(5) (2019). On appeal, he contends that he did not understand the instructions his prior attorney gave him on how to file the completed asylum application while he was in detention, and the attorney did not advise him of the consequences of failing to timely file. However, the respondent makes no claim that the attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Nor did he comply with the procedural steps for asserting such a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5)(iii)(A)-(C). Under these circumstances, the respondent’s asylum claim was properly pretermitted.
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish eligibility for withholding of removal under the Act because he failed to prove that he was persecuted in the past or that he faces a clear probability of persecution upon his return to Guatemala. See section 241(b)(3)(A) of the Act; Stevic, 467 U.S. at 429-30; 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b).
 
Persecution is “an ‘extreme concept,’ requiring ‘more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.”D’ Sepulveda v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). To rise to the level of persecution, the claimed physical harm generally must involve severe mistreatment. See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 577 F.3d 1341, 1353 (11th Cir. 2009) (finding no persecution where the applicant was detained for 4 days, interrogated and beaten for 5 hours, and subsequently monitored by authorities, but he suffered no physical harm).
 
The respondent has not established that he suffered past persecution because the one incident where the men threatened him, put him in handcuffs, and beat and struck him on the shoulder with the butt of a gun was not severe enough to rise to the level of persecution. He was briefly detained in his home and did not suffer any permanent physical injury or seek formal medical attention from a doctor for his shoulder injury, being treated by a lay person instead. See Martin v. Sessions, 723 F. App’x. 35, 37-38 (11th Cir. 2018) (stating that an alien who did not testify that he suffered any injuries or sought medical treatment did not establish that the harm he alleged rose to the level of past persecution); Jian Qiu Liu v. Holder, 632 F.3d 820, 822 (2d Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (finding that an alien who “suffered only minor bruising from an altercation . . ., which required no formal medical attention and had no lasting physical effect” had not experienced past persecution).
 
**12 In the absence of past persecution, the respondent is not entitled to a presumption of a clear probability of future persecution. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1). He has not presented evidence that anyone is looking for him or asking about his whereabouts. On this record, the respondent did not establish past persecution or a clear probability of future persecution to *722 meet the high burden of proof to qualify for withholding of removal. See Chen v. Gonzales, 470 F.3d 1131, 1138 (5th Cir.2006) (stating that “the requirement of “clear probability’ of persecution requires the applicant to show a higher objective likelihood of persecution than that required for asylum”); Matter of Y-B-, 21 I&N Dec. 1136, 1139 (BIA 1998); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2).
 
Further, the Immigration Judge did not clearly err in finding that the respondent failed to establish that the Government of Guatemala is unwilling or unable to protect him from the men who threatened and beat him. An alien “who alleges persecution by a private actor must prove that his home country is unwilling or unable to protect him” because the Act only protects him “against persecution by non-governmental groups that the government cannot control.” Ayala v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 605 F.3d 941, 950 (11th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted); see also De Castro-Gutierrez v. Holder, 713 F.3d 375, 381 (8th Cir. 2013) (stating that “an alien seeking to establish persecution based on the violent conduct of private actors must show more than ‘difficulty controlling’ private behavior” (citation omitted)); Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 337 (A.G. 2018) (same). It was proper for the Immigration Judge to find that the reason the respondent’s attackers fled when they learned an official police car was en route was that they feared bona fide police officers were coming to the respondent’s aid. See Guillen-Hernandez v. Holder, 592 F.3d 883, 887 (8th Cir. 2010) (stating that certain evidence reflected that the applicant “fear[ed] punishment at the hands of a government ready and willing to enforce its criminal laws”).
 
The respondent also did not report the threatening phone call or the incident at his house to the police, and there is no showing that it would have been futile to do so. See Mulyani v. Holder, 771 F.3d 190, 199 (4th Cir. 2014) (noting that the alien “never notified the police or any other governmental authorities” about the attacks on her, and her claim that the government was unable or unwilling to control her attackers was belied by the fact that they fled when a man nearby yelled at them). We recognize that failure to report persecution to local authorities does not automatically bar an alien from asylum and withholding of removal. See Lopez v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 504 F.3d 1341, 1345 (11th Cir. 2007). However, a failure to report “generally is fatal” to a persecution claim unless the alien can show it would be futile to make a report, which the respondent did not do. Id. (citing Mazariegos v. Office of U.S. Att’y Gen., 241 F.3d 1320, 1327 (11th Cir. 2001)); cf. Matter of S-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 1328, 1335 (BIA 2000) (excusing the applicant’s failure to request protection from the Moroccan Government as futile).
 
**13 The country conditions evidence in the record that reported on crime and safety issues in Guatemala also does not establish that it would have been *723 futile for the respondent to report the beating incident to the police. See U.S. Dep’t of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Sec., Overseas Security Advisory Council, Guatemala Crime Safety Report (2017, 2018). Although the reports reflect that the PNC lacks personnel and training to control gang activity and that police investigations typically do not result in an arrest or a conviction, they also indicate that the PNC has made some progress in the reduction of crimes. Further, the fact that the police were dispatched to the respondent’s home when they were called is evidence that the Immigration Judge reasonably considered in finding that it would not have been futile for the respondent to report the beating incident. Consequently, we conclude that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s application for withholding of removal under the Act.8
  
III. CONCLUSION
 
The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s application for protection under the Convention Against Torture. He determined that the men who beat, robbed, and threatened the respondent were not public officials and, even if they were, they were not acting in an official capacity and were therefore rogue officials. Further, the Immigration Judge properly concluded that the respondent did not establish his eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal under the Act. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Adoption of the Convention Against Torture in 1984 culminated more than a decade of efforts at the international level to prohibit the practice of torture. In 1973, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 3059 rejecting “any form of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” G.A. Res. 3059 (XXVIII) (Nov. 2, 1973). Two years later, it adopted the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. G.A. Res. 3452 (XXX) (Dec. 9, 1975). The Declaration was the foundation for the Convention.

Prior to 2002, the regulations regarding the Convention Against Torture in Part 208 of title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations were issued by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”), which was part of the Department of Justice. The functions of the INS were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, § 403, 116 Stat. 2135, 2178 (amended 2003). The Department of Justice subsequently published a final rule reorganizing title 8 to reflect the transfer of those functions and the division of jurisdiction over the regulations. See Aliens and Nationality; Homeland Security; Reorganization of Regulations, 68 Fed. Reg. 10,349, 10,349 (Mar. 5, 2003) (Supplementary Information).

We recognize that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that there is no “rogue official” exception to protection under the Convention Against Torture and 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a). Barajas-Romero v. Lynch, 846 F.3d 351, 362-63 (9th Cir. 2017). The court reads the regulation’s use of the word “or” rather than “and” between the phrases “public official” and “other person acting in an official capacity” to mean that torturous conduct may be inflicted by a public official acting in a private capacity and be covered by the Convention Against Torture. This is inconsistent with our interpretation of the regulation, which, like the treaty, “deals only with torture committed in the context of governmental authority” or “inflicted under color of law.” S. Exec. Rep. No. 101-30 at 6, 14; see also 64 Fed. Reg. at 8483.
Regarding the regulatory language, the issue is whether the phrase “acting in an official capacity” is intended to qualify only the term “other person,” or if it also applies to “a public official.” If the regulation is read as “a public official” or “other person acting in an official capacity,” it would provide protection to persons tortured by a public official acting in a private capacity, such as a police officer, or even any government employee who acted in furtherance of his own personal objectives. In our view, this was not the intent of the Convention or the regulation, and the best reading of the regulation is that the phrase “acting in an official capacity” qualifies both ““a public official” and “other person.”
The Ninth Circuit’s interpretation also appears to imply that the term ““public official” is limited to law enforcement or security officials (local or national) who engage in torturous conduct. However, neither the Convention nor 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1) defines the term “public official” in this manner. See Kamara v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 420 F.3d 202, 215 (3d Cir. 2005). Furthermore, its common meaning may include any person in a government position. The term therefore extends beyond law enforcement officers and could apparently encompass other government workers such as teachers and postal workers. See generally Kasneci v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 202, 205 (1st Cir. 2005) (addressing a claim that alleged attacks by townspeople dressed in military uniforms “were carried out by or with the acquiescence of a public official”). This is especially true in forms of government where most employees work for the State. The broadness of the term “public official” further supports our view that it is modified by the phrase “acting in an official capacity” in the regulation.

5

Contrary to the respondent’s argument, Matter of Y-L-, A-G- & R-S-R- remains good law on this point.

6

The Immigration Judge also determined that the respondent did not establish that the five men were acting with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.

7

The Immigration Judge’s reasons for determining that the men were rogue officials were based on reasonable inferences that, while not dispositive as to that fact, were proper for him to make.

8

The Immigration Judge also held that the respondent’s proposed social group was not cognizable under the Act. However, given our disposition of the appeal on other grounds, we need not address this aspect of the decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Amy M. Crossin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Theresa L. Cummings
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider the Board’s February 25, 2019, decision finding that he had waived appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision ordering him removed to his native Mauritania. The Department of Homeland Security opposes reconsideration. The motion is denied.
 
The respondent contends that he did not knowingly or willingly waive appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision. In an affidavit, he states that he did not know what his attorney said at the end of his hearing, and that he was told by her boss “not to worry about” the fact that the paperwork reflected that he had waived his appeal (Motion, Tab A). He avers that he never intended to waive his right to appeal, and always wanted to pursue his case to the extent possible.
 
However, current counsel was aware at the time she filed the respondent’s appeal that the Immigration Judge’s order of removal indicated that both parties had waived appeal. No motion was filed to accept the appeal notwithstanding that information. Absent egregious circumstances, an individual is bound by his attorney’s admissions and concessions. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). Although the respondent now indicates that he was unaware that his attorney waived appeal, he was present at the time of this concession (Tr. at 50, 53). In addition, the respondent has not complied with the requirements for reopening of the proceedings or reconsideration of the Board’s decision based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where this case arises, requires strict compliance with Lozada in order to put forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Hernandez- Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 2014). There is no evidence that the respondent has filed a complaint against former counsel, or reached out to her directly at the contact information provided by her former firm (Motion, Tab B), or at the address reflected on prior counsel’s entry of appearance. Nor does the current motion establish prejudice, as it puts forth no substantive argument for why the respondent should not have been found removable as charged. As the respondent has not complied with the requirements for reconsideration based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, reconsideration is not warranted. Accordingly, the motion is denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

File: AXXX-XX1-654 - York, PA
October 20, 2019
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michelle N. Mendez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 9, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent subject to removal as charged. On April 2, 2019, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The record before us does not contain a reply to the motion from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the motion is therefore deemed unopposed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The proceedings will be reopened and the record will be remanded.
 
The respondent has acknowledged that his motion was not filed within the 90-day filing period established for motions to reopen. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). He argues, however, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during proceedings and that equitable tolling applies to his motion. He also argues that his motion is based on a claim of United States citizenship, which affects the jurisdiction of the Board and the Immigration Court, and that sua sponte reopening is warranted.
 
The respondent has submitted with his motion evidence that includes the respondent’s own statement, a statement from his father, and evidence of the law in his native Liberia concerning marriage, separation, and custody. The respondent argues that his evidence, along with the evidence of record, establishes that he derived United States citizenship from his father under the citizenship law applicable to him, specifically former section 321(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1432(a), repealed by section 103(a), title I, Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-395, 114 Stat. 1631. See Matter of Nwozuzu, 24 I&N Dec. 609 (BIA 2008) (analyzing a derivative citizenship claim under former section 321(a) of the Act).
 
The respondent argues that the attorney who previously represented him failed to obtain the information necessary to establish that he met the requirements for derivative citizenship under former section 321(a) of the Act. Specifically, the attorney failed to show that the respondent’s father had a marital relationship with the respondent’s mother under the law of Liberia and that his parents were legally separated after the respondent’s birth.
 
The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims, as set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 l&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). He has also submitted evidence in support of his citizenship claim that is sufficient to warrant a new hearing. A claim to citizenship raises issues directly related to this Board’s jurisdiction over the instant case. See Matter of Cantu, 17 I&N Dec. 190, 194 (BIA 1978). Here, we find it necessary to reopen proceedings and remand the record for fact-finding and analysis as to whether the respondent has established derivative United States citizenship.
 
*2 Given our finding, we need not address whether the respondent’s former attorney provided less than competent counsel or whether equitable tolling applies to the respondent’s motion.
 
The following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The proceedings in this matter are reopened pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael C. Urbina-Pabon, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jack D. Spencer
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 20, 2019, decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia after he did not appear for a scheduled hearing on January 7, 2001. The respondent argues that notice was not proper in his case and he alternatively requests that proceedings be reopened sua sponte. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded where an alien files a motion to reopen within 180 days establishing that exceptional circumstances caused the failure to appear. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). An alien may file a motion to reopen at any time based on lack of notice of the underlying removal proceeding. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The respondent received personal service of the Notice to Appear (Ex. 1) that advised him of the need to attend all hearings and of the consequences of failing to appear. The respondent argues, in part, that he did not understand his obligation to attend removal proceedings because he was 15 or 16 years old at the time he was personally served with a Notice to Appear. See Respondent’s Br. at 6. However, removal proceedings may be properly commenced through service of a Notice to Appear on an alien who is 14 years or older (IJ at 2-3). See Matter of Cubor-Cruz, 25 I&N Dec. 470, 473 (BIA 2011); 8 C.F.R. § 103.8(c)(2)(ii). We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate that he did not receive proper service of the hearing notice through some fault of the attorney who filed a motion for a change of venue on his behalf (IJ at 3). See Respondent’s Br. at 6. The respondent has not complied with any of the requirements to establish ineffective assistance of counsel that are set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The motion for a change of venue was granted and the subsequent hearing notice was sent to the address provided in the motion. The hearing notice was not returned as undeliverable and the respondent has not overcome the presumption that the notice was properly delivered (IJ at 3). See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not met his burden to establish that notice was not proper in his case. See id.
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent argues that exceptional circumstances should excuse his failure to appear, see Respondent’s Br. at 6-7, such a motion is untimely by many years. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. As discussed, the respondent has not demonstrated that he did not receive proper notice of his obligation to attend proceedings or of the hearing itself (IJ at 3-4). The respondent alternatively argues that proceedings should be reopened sua sponte to facilitate his pursuit of an immigrant visa based on his marriage to a United States citizen. See Respondent’s Br. at 8. However, becoming potentially eligible for an immigration benefit many years after the entry of an in absentia order of removal is not unusual and we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances that warrant the sua sponte reopening of proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to reopen proceedings sua sponte is not meant to circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship).
 
For the aforementioned reasons, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX-XX3-205 - San Diego, CA
July 31, 2019
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stephanie M. Alcala, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 1, 2018. The Immigration Judge deemed the respondent to have abandoned any applications for relief due to his failure to file an application by the filing deadline, and ordered the respondent’s removal. The respondent’s appeal from that decision will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying him a continuance in order that he might prepare and submit unspecified applications for relief. We conclude that the respondent did not establish good cause for a further continuance. See Matter of L-A-B-R-, 27 I&N Dec. 405 (A.G. 2018); Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6.
 
The record reflects that the respondent was in proceedings since April 2014, and was granted multiple continuances in order to obtain counsel. At a hearing held on November 14, 2017, the Immigration Judge set a filing deadline of February 1, 2018, for any applications for relief. The Immigration Judge advised the respondent directly, as well as the respondent’s counsel, of the consequences of failure to file by the deadline (Tr. at 75-77). However, at the following hearing on February 1, 2019, the respondent and counsel appeared without any applications for relief. The respondent’s counsel stated that due to a calendaring error, he did not realize the matter was set for filing, and furthermore he was in the hospital a week prior (Tr. at 81-82). The Immigration Judge deemed any applications for relief abandoned, and ordered the respondent’s removal (IJ at 2-3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The regulations provide that an Immigration Judge has the authority to set deadlines for the filing of applications, and may deem an application abandoned if it is not filed by the deadline established by the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.31(a), (c). The respondent’s arguments on appeal do not establish error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to deem his applications for relief abandoned. The record reflects that the respondent had sufficient time in which to prepare and submit any applications to the Immigration Court. See Matter of C-B-, 25 I&N Dec. 888, 889-890 (BIA 2012) (an applicant must be granted a reasonable and realistic amount of time and provided a fair opportunity to seek, speak with, and retain counsel); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983).
 
*2 Insofar as the respondent asserts that his counsel erred in miscalendaring the hearing, we note that he has not substantially complied with the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). We conclude that the respondent did not establish good cause for his failure to timely file any applications. We also note that on appeal the respondent has not submitted any completed applications, or identified any form of relief for which he may be eligible. We therefore conclude that a remand is not warranted. See Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 414 (BIA 1996) (holding that in order to justify a remand the applicant must establish prima facie eligibility for the underlying relief sought); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX-XX9-873 - New York, NY

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pankaj Malik, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s January 29, 2019, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) did not file a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or state custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 722-23 (BIA 1999).
 
The respondent entered the United States on March 11, 2001. He was detained upon entry, and on March 13, 2001, was personally served with a Notice to Appear (“NTA”). On September 25, 2001, a Notice of Hearing (“NOH”) was sent to the respondent, informing him that he should appear for his hearing on January 3, 2002, at the Immigration Court in New York, NY. The respondent did not appear for his hearing on that date, and an Immigration Judge ordered him removed after a hearing held in absentia. The respondent was mailed a copy of the in absentia removal order at his address on record.
 
More than 17 years later, on January 8, 2019, the respondent filed a motion to reopen his in absentia removal order with the Immigration Judge. On January 29, 2019, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion finding that he had not established exceptional circumstances or overcome the presumption of delivery of the notice of the hearing.
 
The respondent presents a due process challenge to the Immigration Judge’s 2002 in absentia order of removal, premised on his argument that he did not have proper notice of the hearing. The respondent asserts that he demonstrated a lack of notice or exceptional circumstances for not attending the scheduled hearing on January 3, 2002. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). He claims he only learned of the in absentia removal order in 2019 when he was taken into DHS’s custody (Respondent’s Br. at 6). He claims that the non-receipt of the January 3, 2002, hearing constitutes sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of delivery.
 
*2 The respondent’s motion to reopen and to rescind the in absentia removal order was untimely, as it was filed on January 8, 2019, more than 180 days after the in absentia removal order was entered on January 3, 2002 (IJ at 1-3). See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish that equitable tolling of the 180-day deadline for filing his motion is warranted (IJ at 3-4). Alternatively, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish that exceptional circumstances beyond his control excused his failure to appear for his January 3, 2002, hearing (IJ at 3-4). See section 240(e)(1) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
The respondent was personally served with an NTA, advised of his address obligations, and the NOH was sent to the address he provided on the Form I-830, Notice to EOIR: Alien Address (IJ at 1-2; Exh. 1; NOH dated September 25, 2001). Ineffective assistance of counsel may constitute an exceptional circumstance if the ineffective assistance results in an alien’s failure to appear at his hearing. See Aris v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 599 (2d Cir. 2008). We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion to reopen based on his claim of ineffective assistance of prior counsel does not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988) (IJ at 3).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the NOH mailed to the address in the Form I-830 was sufficient to constitute notice to the respondent (IJ at 4). The Form I-830 contains indicia of reliability. Specifically, the form indicates that upon release from legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) custody, the respondent reported his address to be 1047 Wilson Boulevard, Central Islip, New York 11722. In addition, the form is signed by a legacy INS officer. As the respondent was personally served with the NTA, he was required to notify the Immigration Court and the legacy INS of any change of address within five days. The last address provided by the respondent was the Form I-830, and therefore it was proper to use that address to send notice of hearing. Section 1229(a) of the Act requires notice of a change of address, yet does not place any restrictions on who may provide that notice.
 
The respondent asserts that unbeknownst to him, Ms. Quevedo, a notario, provided the address in the Form I-830 presumably when she posted bond. He implies that Ms. Quevedo did not advise him of the address she provided in the Form I-830. To the extent the respondent implies that because he did not sign the Form I-830, he is not responsible for the address reflected therein, we disagree (Respondent’s Br. at 4, 14). The notice indicates that the Wilson Boulevard address was provided by the respondent. The form does not indicate that the address was provided by Ms. Quevedo. The respondent has failed to show error in the mailing of the notice of hearing to the Wilson Boulevard address obtained from the Form I-830.
 
*3 We presume that a properly addressed notice sent via regular mail is received by the addressee. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). However, the burden of proof for rebutting that presumption is weaker when items are sent by regular mail as opposed to certified mail. See id. The Board considers all relevant evidence in determining whether an alien has rebutted the presumption. Such evidence includes but is not limited to factors such as affidavits from the respondent and others who are knowledgeable about whether notice was received, whether due diligence was exercised in seeking to redress the situation, any prior applications for relief that would indicate an incentive to appear, and the respondent’s prior appearance at immigration proceedings, if applicable. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 665; see also Matter of C-R-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 677 (BIA 2008).
 
We are not persuaded that the respondent has rebutted the presumption of delivery. The NOH was mailed to the address provided by the respondent upon release from custody (Form I-830). The Immigration Judge reasonably noted that although the respondent claims that he advised the court at his June 14, 2001, hearing that Ms. Quevedo’s address was not where he was residing, the record lacks a change of address form that reflects any other address for the respondent other than the one he “repeatedly provided to the Court” (IJ at 4 and n.4). See section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(B) (eliminating the notice requirement where the alien fails to provide the required contact information); see also M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 674-75 (finding that a respondent cannot evade delivery of a properly sent Notice of Hearing by relocating without providing the required change of address and then request reopening of in absentia proceedings on the basis of a claim that he did not receive notice) (citation omitted). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not rebutted the presumption of delivery.
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that he should have been provided more time to respond to the DHS’s opposition to his motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order (Respondent’s Br. at 7-10). The respondent asserts that before he had an opportunity to respond to the DHS’s opposition, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion (Id.). Citing the Immigration Court Practice Manual, the respondent contends that he should have been allowed 10 days to respondent to DHS’s opposition (Id. at 8-9). See Immigration Court Practice Manual Rule 3.1(b)(iv). However, the Immigration Judge is not bound by parties’ filing deadlines from the Immigration Court Practice Manual, which itself is not binding authority. Appendix D from the Manual states that the deadlines are for guidance only, and that the Immigration Judge has discretion to set deadlines. Although the respondent asserts that the DHS’s opposition was untimely (Respondent’s Br. at 7), the Immigration Judge has discretion as to deadlines. Moreover, the respondent has not articulated what his response would have been if he had been provided additional time to respond, or otherwise shown that the outcome of his case would have been different.
 
*4 The respondent also relies upon an unpublished Board decision (Respondent’s Br. at 16-17). However, as the respondent acknowledges, unpublished Board decisions are not binding precedents (Id.). Matter of Echeverria, 25 I&N Dec. 512, 519 (BIA 2011). Further, the unpublished Board decision presented by the respondent on appeal rests upon specific factual scenarios pertinent to that case.
 
Moreover, having received proper notice of his hearing, we agree with the Immigration Judge that under the totality of the circumstances, the respondent has not met his burden of establishing that his failure to appear for his scheduled hearing was due to “exceptional circumstances.” See Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, 509 (BIA 1996) (noting that one must look to the “totality of circumstances” to resolve this issue of exceptional circumstances); see also Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33 (BIA 1998); Matter of B-A-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 1998).
 
The respondent also asserts that the in absentia removal order cannot stand because it is based on a non-compliant NTA or NOH (Respondent’s Br. at 11-12). He relies on Matter of Bulnes, 25 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 2009) and Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001). We disagree. For the reasons cited above, the respondent has not established that he received less than sufficient notice. Therefore, on this record, he has not established a non-compliant NTA or NOH.
 
Further, if it is necessary to reach this issue, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not shown that he exercised due diligence in his case (IJ at 4). The respondent does not allege that he took any steps to inquire into the status of his case during the more than 17-year period between the issuance of the in absentia removal order on January 3, 2002, and the filing of the motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order on January 8, 2019.
 
The record establishes that the respondent was properly notified of the time and place of his scheduled removal hearing. The respondent does not allege that he was in Federal or state custody at the time of the hearing, and has not otherwise shown that his failure to appear was due to “exceptional circumstances” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act. We are not persuaded by the respondent’s arguments that the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order should be rescinded. See 8 C. F. R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Therefore, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen his in absentia removal order.
 
*5 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: DANIEL ORLANDO PIMENTEL-HERRERA
File: AXXX-XX5-977 - San Francisco, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jody E. Santiago, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cynthia A. Gutierrez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening; termination
 
*1 This case was last before us on April 30, 2002. At that time, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s underlying January 6, 2000, decision, in which he denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on October 22, 1999, pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). On July 23, 2018, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider and terminate the proceedings in light of Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018), and in the alternative, a motion to reopen and remand to the Immigration Judge. The Department of Homeland Security has filed a response in opposition to the respondent’s motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reconsider is untimely because it was not filed within 30 days of our April 30, 2002, decision. See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The respondent argues that his motion should be considered timely under the doctrine of equitable tolling. He argues that the Supreme Court’s decision in Pereira v. Sessions constitutes an extraordinary circumstance that prevented him from timely filing a motion to reconsider and that he pursued his case with reasonable diligence. He further argues that, under Pereira v. Sessions, the “putative” notice to appear issued against him did not specify the time and place of his first removal hearing and was insufficient to vest the Immigration Judge and the Board with jurisdiction over the proceedings. Thus, the respondent argues that the Board should terminate the removal proceedings.
 
We deny the respondent’s motion to the extent that he argues that the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction pursuant to Pereira v. Sessions. See Respondent’s Motion at 4-6. Subsequent to the Supreme Court’s opinion in Pereira, the Board issued Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441 (BIA 2018), in which we held that Pereira does not stand for the proposition that the respondent contends. See Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. at 443; Karingithi v. Whitaker, 913 F.3d 1158 (9th Cir. 2019) (deferring to the Board’s decision in Matter of Bermudez-Cota);; Lopez v. Barr, No. 15-72406, 2019 WL 2202952, at* 8 (9th Cir. May 22, 2019) (noting that a regulation, not the statutory definition of a notice to appear, governs what a notice must contain to vest jurisdiction and that Pereira simply has no application to the Immigration Court’s jurisdiction). Additionally, the respondent’s case is controlled by Matter of Miranda-Cordiero, 27 I&N Dec. 551, 554 (BIA 2019), in which we distinguished Pereira and held that pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), a notice to appear that did not specify the time and place of the initial removal hearing does not require the rescission of an in absentia order of removal nor termination of proceedings. See also Matter of Pena-Mejia, 27 I&N Dec. 546, 548 (BIA 2019). Under these circumstances, we conclude that jurisdiction properly vested with the Immigration Judge such that reconsideration of our prior decision, reopening and rescission of the in absentia order of removal, or termination of these proceedings on jurisdictional grounds is not warranted.1
 
*2 The respondent also argues in the alternative that the Board should reopen the proceedings and remand to the Immigration Judge based on the ineffective assistance of his prior attorney. He acknowledges that his motion to reopen is untimely as it was filed more than 90 days after the final order of removal. See section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). However, he argues that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled because he did not learn of his prior attorney’s ineffective assistance until he met with his new attorney on July 17, 2018, and that he acted with due diligence in pursuing his case. Further, he argues that his prior attorney’s ineffective assistance prejudiced his case because she did not submit any evidence in support of the motion to reopen his in absentia removal order, which deprived him of the opportunity to remedy the prior in absentia order and to seek any relief from removal.
 
We conclude that, while the respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), he has not demonstrated due diligence warranting equitable tolling of the filing deadline. In order to be entitled to equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must show due diligence in discovering his attorney’s deception, fraud, or error. Bonilla v. Lynch, 840 F.3d 757, 582 (9th Cir. 2016). Three factors are considered: (1) if (and when) a reasonable person in the respondent’s position would suspect the specific fraud or error underlying the motion to reopen; (2) whether the respondent took reasonable steps to investigate the attorney’s suspected fraud or error, or, if the respondent is ignorant of the attorney’s shortcomings, whether he made reasonable efforts to pursue relief; and (3) when the tolling period should end; that is, when the respondent definitively learns of the harm resulting from counsel’s deficiency. Id.; Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2011).
 
The respondent was 16 years old at the time he entered the United States and has stated in his affidavit attached to his motion that his father hired Attorney Reinholdt to file a motion to reopen the in absentia removal order with the Immigration Judge and an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion with the Board. He states that after the Board denied his appeal in 2002, he assumed his case was lost and that he did not become aware of the ineffective assistance of Ms. Reinholdt until he met with and retained his new attorney Jody Santiago in July 2018.
 
The Board found in its 2002 decision that the respondent had ample opportunity but did not provide any affidavits or other evidence to establish his claim that he believed he did not have to appear on his hearing date because he was a minor and thought he could appear with his father at his hearing on a different date. The Board also held the respondent did not show anything more than a misunderstanding about the hearing date and did not show any reason for failing to appear that rose to the level of exceptional circumstances. The respondent was an adult at the time of the Board’s decision, and a reasonable person in his position would suspect fraud or error or would take reasonable steps to investigate the attorney’s suspected fraud or error. Even assuming the respondent was ignorant of the attorney’s possible fraud or error, the respondent has not shown that he made reasonable efforts to pursue relief between 2002 and 2018 when he filed his motion to reopen. Bonilla v. Lynch, 840 F.3d at 583. The respondent has not detailed any efforts to seek legal assistance between 2002 and 2018 or explained why he waited 16 years to address his 2002 removal order. Id. Thus, the respondent did not make reasonable efforts to pursue relief and did not demonstrate the diligence necessary for equitable tolling.
 
*3 To the extent that the respondent requests sua sponte reopening (Respondent’s Motion at 16-17), the circumstances of this case do not present any exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to sua sponte reconsider or reopen proceedings is reserved for “exceptional situations” and “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”).
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

The respondent also argues in his motion that under Pereira the putative notice to appear did not interrupt his period of continuous physical presence required to qualify for cancellation of removal, and the proceedings should be reopened to allow him to apply for such relief. However, in light of our finding that the respondent has not exercised the due diligence necessary for equitable tolling of the filing deadline and has not shown that the in absentia order of removal should be rescinded, we need not reach this issue.

File: AXXX-XX0-619 - Dallas, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lorena S. Rivas, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion requesting that the Board reconsider our August 15, 2018, decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen his order of removal in absentia. See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must identify an error of fact or law in the decision for which reconsideration is being requested. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). The respondent argues that the Board erred in affirming the decision of the Immigration Judge because his failure to appear in court was due to exceptional circumstances (Respondent’s Mot. to Reconsider at 5-7). Specifically, the respondent argues that he did not receive proper notice of his removal hearings because the DHS served him with an invalid Notice to Appear (“NTA”) pursuant to Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018), because it did not specify the date or time of his removal proceedings (Respondent’s Mot. to Reconsider at 5-7).
 
The respondent also argues that he made a good faith attempt to update the Immigration Court with his new address by notifying his prior attorney, and that his prior attorney’s failure to update the Immigration Court constitutes an exceptional circumstance warranting reopening (Respondent’s Mot. to Reconsider at 7-9). Finally, the respondent argues that because he made “all reasonable attempts to update his address with the Immigration Court, his in absentia order contravenes the Constitutional requirement of due process.” (Respondent’s Mot. to Reconsider at 10).
 
As a threshold issue, an NTA that does not specify the time and place of an applicant’s initial removal hearing vests an Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over the removal proceedings and meets the requirements of section 239(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a), so long as a notice of hearing specifying this information is later sent to the applicant. Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441 (BIA 2018). The respondent argues that his case is distinguishable from the circumstance outlined in Matter of Bermudez-Cota because he never received notice of his removal hearing and he does not seek termination of his removal proceedings (Respondent’s Mot. to Reconsider at 5-7).
 
*2 In this case, a hearing notice was sent to the address on file with the Immigration Court on September 23, 2016, specifying the date and time of the respondent’s removal proceedings. Thus, the NTA in this case was not defective and jurisdiction vested with the Immigration Judge, and the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia order of removal. See id. at 446-47.
 
Moreover, the respondent did not file a Form EOIR-33 to report his correct address with the Immigration Court, even though the NTA, which was personally served on the respondent, provided the required warnings and consequences of his failure to attend any future hearings, as well as his obligation to notify the Immigration Court of his address and the consequences of failing to do so (Exh. 1). Thus, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia order of removal. See section 240(b)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5); Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674-75 (BIA 2008) (stating that an applicant must comply with the statutory responsibility to provide current address information under section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(F), in order to prevail on a motion to reopen or rescind an in absentia order of removal); see also Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d 354 (5th Cir. 2009).
 
In addition, the Immigration Judge found that the prior attorney who the respondent claimed provided ineffective assistance of counsel by not updating the respondent’s address with the Immigration Court did not represent the respondent in his immigration proceedings and was not informed of the respondent’s address change (IJ at 2-3). The respondent does not identify any error in this determination, which is not clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (the Board reviews findings of fact for clear error); see also Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985) (holding that ““[w]here there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.”). Thus, because the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen on this basis, the respondent has not identified any error of fact or law in the Board’s affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Finally, as discussed above, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, although the respondent argues on appeal that he exercised “all reasonable attempts to update his address with the Immigration Court,” there is no indication in the record that he attempted to file a change of address form himself with the Immigration Court (Respondent’s Mot. to Reconsider at 10). See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (holding that statements of counsel are not evidence). Thus, the respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge’s decision violated his due process rights. See Ka Fung Chan v. INS, 634 F.2d 248, 258 (5th Cir. 1981) (finding no due process violation when the applicant could not establish prejudice resulting from the claimed error).
 
*3 In sum, the respondent has not identified an error of fact or law in our previous decision in this case such that it merits reconsideration. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). Accordingly, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN RE: TOMASZ KOLODZIEJCZYK

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gail A. Dulay, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Adam E. Mattei
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on May 9, 2018, when we denied the respondent’s untimely and number-barred motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. On June 7, 2018, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider requesting the Board reconsider its decision denying his motion to reopen.1 The motion is also in the nature of another untimely and number-barred motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief in opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
We first address that aspect of the motion requesting reconsideration. A motion to reconsider shall specify “errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). The respondent’s motion establishes no error in our determination that he did not establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and did not warrant sua sponte reopening. The respondent reiterates the arguments raised in his previous motion to the Board. We considered those arguments and found them unpersuasive when viewed within the record as a whole before we denied his motion to reopen. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. at 58 (stating that “a motion to reconsider is not a process by which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief presented on appeal . . .”). Disagreement with the result is not sufficient. Therefore, the motion to reconsider is denied.
 
As a motion to reopen, it is untimely and number barred, as it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s February 22, 2013, final order dismissing his appeal, and it is not the respondent’s first motion to reopen. Sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent continues to assert that equitable tolling of the time and number limits on his motion to reopen is warranted based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and seeks to submit evidence that he has now complied with the requirements laid out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Even assuming that the respondent has now properly complied with the Lozada requirements, he still has not established prejudice from prior counsel’s actions or inactions. See Jiang v. Mukasey, 522 F.3d 266, 270 (2d Cir. 2008) (stating that to succeed on a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance an applicant must show, inter alia, “that the applicant was prejudiced by his counsel’s performance.”). The immediate relative visa petition (Form I-130) that was filed on the respondent’s behalf by his second United States citizen spouse was not approved by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) until months after the Board’s February 2013 final decision on the merits. Thus, it is speculative that a motion to remand would have been granted, especially given the procedural history of this case, i.e. the respondent previously attempted to adjust his status based on a prior marriage to a different United States citizen who failed to appear for the respondent’s hearing. Consequently, the respondent has not demonstrated that the ultimate outcome might have been affected by his prior counsels. Thus, the motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred, and the respondent has not shown prejudice to warrant equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Finally, we decline to exercise our discretion to reopen proceedings sua sponte because the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). Having considered the record in its entirety and do not find present an exceptional circumstance sufficient to warrant the exercise of our sua sponte authority.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.2
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: GIOVANNY CAMACHO FLORES
File: AXXX XX0 686 - Orlando, FL
February 1, 2019
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Daniela Hogue, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Chelsea Rubin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. On May 21, 2015, the Immigration Judge issued an order of removal in absentia. On October 22, 2015, and April 25, 2018, the Immigration Judge denied motions to reopen. The respondent filed a timely appeal from the Immigration Judge’s April 25, 2018, order. On May 16, 2018, the Board denied the respondent’s motion for an emergency stay and the respondent was removed on May 23, 2018. The Department of Homeland Security requests that the Board summarily affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s April 25, 2018, order denying his second motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of former counsel. The respondent contends that his former counsel apparently received notice of his hearing, but did not advise the respondent of the hearing date. The respondent also alleges that former counsel did not advise him that an in absentia order had been issued or that former counsel was filing a motion to reopen. Since former counsel did not appear at his hearing and did not notify the respondent of the hearing, the respondent contends that his failure to appear was due to ineffective assistance of former counsel.
 
Since notice to counsel is notice to the respondent, the respondent is deemed to have notice. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2). See also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). Therefore the respondent was required to file his motion to reopen within 180 days of the in absentia order of removal and demonstrate exceptional circumstances as to why he did not appear. Section 240(b)(5) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
The respondent’s first motion to reopen was timely filed, but he did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances. The respondent did not file a Notice of Appeal with respect to the Immigration Judge’s October 22, 2015, order denying the first motion to reopen.
 
*2 The respondent’s second motion, the denial of which is currently before us on appeal, was not timely filed. The respondent contends that equitable tolling of the time and number bar should apply due to ineffective assistance of former counsel. See Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 713 F.3d. 1357, 1362 n. 3, 1364-65 (11th Cir. 2013) (equitable tolling applies to in absentia orders); Montano-Cisneros v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 514 F.3d 1224 (11th Cir. 2008). The respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). There is no evidence that former counsel responded to the complaint.
 
The Immigration Judge properly declined to equitably toll the time and number bars based on ineffective assistance of counsel. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate that he pursued his rights diligently. See Avila-Santoyo v. Atty Gen., 713 F.3d. at 1363 n. 5 (11th Cir. 2013). The respondent was aware of his in absentia order of removal as of January 2016, but his second motion was not filed until April 17, 2018, about 15 months later (IJ Attachment, April 25, 2018; Motion to Reopen, Tab A at paras. 14-20, April 17, 2018).
 
Soon after becoming aware of the in absentia order of removal, the respondent discussed his case with his former lawyer and then Catholic Charities (Motion to Reopen, Tab A at paras. 14-21), but there is no evidence that he engaged his former lawyer or Catholic Charities to formally review or further pursue his case. He avers that he reached out to a couple of other lawyers but this general assertion does not demonstrate that he was diligently pursuing his rights. Further, he did not contact his current firm until February 2017, over a year after learning about the in absentia order of removal. Considering these circumstances, the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion.
 
We decline to exercise our sua sponte discretionary authority to reopen proceedings because the respondent has not demonstrated an exceptional situation justifying the exercise of our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrea A. Saenz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Caroline Clark
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals an Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 31, 2018, which denied his request for a continuance.1 The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a brief in opposition to the appeal. The respondent indicated in his Notice of Appeal that he would be filing a brief on appeal, but has not done so.2 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request for a continuance so that he could apply for special immigrant juvenile (“SIJ”) status (IJ at 2-3). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not shown “good cause” for a continuance (IJ at 2-3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29 (an Immigration Judge may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown). In determining whether good cause exists to continue removal proceedings to await the resolution of a collateral matter, an Immigration Judge should consider: (1) the likelihood that the alien will receive the collateral relief, and (2) whether the relief will materially affect the outcome of the removal proceedings. See Matter of L-A-B-R-, 27 I&N Dec. 405, 413 (BIA 2018). The Immigration Judge should also consider ““whether the alien has exercised reasonable diligence in pursuing that relief, DHS’s position on the motion, the length of the requested continuance, and the procedural history of the case.” Matter of L-A-B-R-, 27 I&N Dec. at 413 (stating that the “good-cause standard in section 1003.29 requires consideration and balancing of all relevant factors in assessing a motion for continuance to accommodate a collateral matter”).
 
The respondent was granted one continuance before the Immigration Judge from June 20, 2018, to July 31, 2018 (IJ at 2; Tr. at 1-2, 5). The respondent did not provide evidence that he filed a Form I-360 petition for SIJ status with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (IJ at 2; Tr. at 12). Although the respondent contends in his Notice of Appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in stating that he was not eligible for SIJ status because he was over 18, the respondent did not submit evidence that he was prima facie eligible for SIJ relief, either before the Immigration Judge, or on appeal (Notice of Appeal; IJ at 2). Thus, based on the aforementioned, we agree that the respondent did not make a persuasive showing of good cause for his requested continuance (IJ at 2-3).
 
*2 The respondent contends in his Notice of Appeal that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel, presumably by not filing for SIJ status (Notice of Appeal). However, the respondent has not shown that he complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Further, to show ineffective assistance of counsel prejudice must be shown. Omar v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 647 (2d Cir. 2008). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent has not made this showing inasmuch as he has not shown that he is eligible for SIJ relief.
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent had conceded removability (IJ at 2). Inasmuch as the respondent has not appealed that determination, we deem it waived. See Matter of R-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 657, 658 n.2 (BIA 2012).

The respondent filed a motion on November 8, 2018, requesting more time to file his brief pending the return of the respondent to the United States after he had been wrongfully removed. The Board sent the respondent’s attorney a letter dated November 13, 2018, informing her that the briefing schedule would not be suspended. A Form I-830 (Notice to EOIR: Alien address) shows that the respondent is now being detained at the Bergen County Jail in New Jersey and thus has presumably been returned.

File: AXXX-XX8-702 - Kansas City, MO
December 28, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew L. Hoppock, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mohammad Abdelaziz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on August 13, 2018, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to terminate and finding him removable as charged. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief in opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent argues in the motion that his proceedings should be reopened because he is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel by the attorney who represented him on appeal before the Board. Specifically, he alleges that prior counsel failed to raise the most important issues in his appeal brief, failed to cite to controlling Board and Circuit Court precedent, and failed to apprise the Board of the bases for the appeal (Motion at 1).
 
As an initial matter, we agree with the DHS that the respondent has not substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and ineffective assistance of counsel is not clear on the face of the record. See Habchy v. Gonzales, All F.3d 858 (8th Cir. 2006). Although respondent’s current counsel sent his former counsel an email advising him that a disciplinary complaint had been filed, prior counsel was not given an opportunity to respond to the allegations in advance of the filing of the complaint or the respondent’s motion with the Board. The aforementioned email correspondence is dated October 8, 2018, and acknowledges that a bar complaint had already been filed with the Pennsylvania Disciplinary Authority (Motion at Tab A). Moreover, the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed with the Board on October 9, 2018, one day after the email was sent to prior counsel. We do not find this was sufficient time for respondent’s counsel to respond to the allegations. Further, we note that the respondent has submitted a letter from former counsel dated August 28, 2018, regarding his representation of the respondent before the Board and discussions with the respondent regarding possible representation of the respondent in conjunction with a Petition for Review before the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (Motion at Tab B). However, this letter was drafted and sent out prior to current counsel being obtained and over a month before the allegations of ineffectiveness were alleged.
 
Even assuming that the respondent properly complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, the motion is denied because the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice. Valencia v. Holder, 657 F.3d 745, 749 (8th Cir. 2011), citing Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 638. The Eighth Circuit has held that, in order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, aliens must establish that they were prejudiced by their counsel’s performance, which in turn requires a showing that their attorney’s performance was so inadequate that it “may well have resulted in a deportation that would not otherwise have occurred.” Obleshchenko v. Ashcroft, 392 F.3d 970, 972 (8th Cir. 2004); Al-Khouri v. Ashcroft, 362 F.3d 461, 466 (8th Cir. 2004). The court further elaborated that this standard is akin to the requirement under the Sixth Amendment that there be “a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Obleshchenko v. Ashcroft, 392 F.3d at 972.
 
*2 Despite the contentions in the respondent’s motion, the appeal brief contained the arguments that the respondent is now alleging where not raised. The Board considered the arguments regarding whether the foreign conviction was obtained in absentia and thus was inconsistent with United States standards of due process, whether the foreign conviction statute was divisible, and whether the DHS had established the respondent was the same person as the defendant in the criminal proceedings (See Decision of the Board, dated August 13, 2018, at 2-3). We considered all of these arguments and found them unpersuasive when we dismissed his appeal. Specifically, as the DHS notes in its opposition to the current motion, the respondent was not convicted in absentia, was represented by counsel, and only absconded before the final appeal in his case was resolved. Thus, none of the case law cited or additional arguments raised in the respondent’s motion to reopen convince us of error in our prior decision. As such, the respondent has not established prejudice from prior counsel’s actions or inactions warranting reopening of his proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.1

IN RE: EDGAR ALBERTO LOPEZ-SANCHEZ
File: AXXX-XX4-889 - Dallas, TX
December 17, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Myong O. Chung, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s June 26, 2018, decision denying the respondent’s motion for a continuance and ordering him removed to Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and, as the respondent did not appear eligible for any form of relief, he ordered the respondent removed (IJ at 3-4). On appeal, the respondent claims that the Immigration Judge erred in not granting him a continuance (Notice of Appeal). An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance “for good cause shown,” within his sound discretion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of L-A-B-R-, 27 I&N Dec. 405 (A.G. 2018); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 790-93 (BIA 2009); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 355-56 (BIA 1983); Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987). “[A]n Immigration Judge’s decision denying [a] motion for continuance will not be reversed unless the alien establishes that the denial caused him actual prejudice and harm and materially affected the outcome of his case.” Matter of Villarreal, 23 I&N Dec. 886, 891 (BIA 2006).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s request for a continuance (IJ at 2-4). The Immigration Judge did not err in not granting another continuance as the respondent did not demonstrate good cause (IJ at 3-4). In the instant case, the respondent requested a continuance so that he could pursue an S visa application with DHS. However, as noted by the Immigration Judge, the DHS has sole jurisdiction over such applications. Thus, we find that the respondent has not demonstrated any prejudice as a result of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his continuance request. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. at 354; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. Accordingly, we find no error in the decision of the Immigration Judge to deny a continuance. Therefore, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
*2 During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand alleging ineffective assistance by his former attorney. We take note that the respondent has not complied with any of the evidentiary requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).1 See also Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948, 953 (5th Cir. 2012) (court requires strict Lozada compliance). Moreover, the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s actions. See De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir. 2004) (noting that “an alien must make an initial showing of substantial prejudice” to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
To the extent that the respondent has submitted new evidence with his appeal, we generally cannot consider any new evidence proffered on appeal. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). The additional documentation here is not sufficiently material as to warrant a remand. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and the motion is denied.

December 13, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Laura Perez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s November 27, 2017, decision denying her motion to reopen her removal proceedings.1 The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent filed a motion to reopen and rescind her in absentia removal order, arguing that her failure to appear at her missed hearing was the result of exceptional circumstances (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen). This motion to reopen is untimely, as it was filed more than 5 years after the respondent was ordered removed on July 19, 2012. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C) of the Act (stating that an in absentia removal order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances). Additionally, because the respondent previously filed a motion to reopen in 2012, her present motion to reopen is number barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (stating that an alien may file only one motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order).
 
The respondent argues that the time and numerical limitations on her motion to reopen should be equitably tolled based on the ineffective assistance rendered by attorney Carlos, whom she hired to file her first motion to reopen (Respondent’s Br. at 16-18)2. Specifically, the respondent alleges that attorney Carlos did not comply with the Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, resulting in the denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen (Respondent’s Br. at 16-17).
 
The respondent has not, however, demonstrated that she acted with due diligence in discovering attorney Carlos’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that equitable tolling of the deadlines and numerical limits for a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel requires that an alien act with reasonable diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). The respondent first had reason to suspect attorney Carlos’s purported deficient representation when the Immigration Judge denied her motion to reopen, in part, because she did not comply with the Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 637, requirements (IJ, Aug. 16, 2012). See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d at 679 (noting that in determining whether an alien exercised due diligence, an adjudicator must first determine if and when a reasonable person in the alien’s position would suspect the specific fraud or error underlying the motion to reopen). The respondent has not shown that she took any affirmative steps-- including consulting with an attorney--to investigate the suspected deficient representation during the approximately 5 years between when her motion to reopen was denied in 2012 and when she hired her present counsel in 2017 (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 21, Tab C). See id. at 680-81. We therefore conclude that the respondent has not exercised due diligence, and is not entitled to equitable tolling of the time and numerical limitations on her motion to reopen.
 
*2 Even if the respondent’s motion to reopen were not time and number barred, she has not demonstrated that her failure to appear at the hearing was the result of exceptional circumstances beyond her control. See section 240(e)(1) of the Act. The respondent claims that she did not attend her July 19, 2012, hearing because her prior attorney did not timely inform her that she needed to attend the hearing (Respondent’s Br. at 13-16). She further argues that this constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and excuses her failure to appear at her missed hearing. See Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, 327 F.3d 892, 896 (9th Cir. 2003) (noting that if an alien fails to appear because of his actual and reasonable reliance on erroneous advice of counsel, it can constitute an exceptional circumstance beyond the alien’s control), amended by 339 F.3d 1012 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
The respondent was given oral notice of her July 19, 2012, hearing by the Immigration Judge on March 31, 2011 (IJ, Nov. 27, 2017; IJ, Aug. 16, 2012). The record further indicates that the respondent was personally served with the notice of hearing for her July 19, 2012, hearing, and that the notice of hearing warns her of the consequences for failing to appear (Notice of Hearing, Mar. 31, 2011). Even if the respondent’s prior attorney did not attempt to timely remind her of the hearing date--a claim the prior attorney disputes--the respondent does not allege in her affidavit or on appeal that she attempted to ask her attorney or the Immigration Court the date of her next hearing (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tabs C, Q). While we recognize that the respondent previously attended two hearings before the Immigration Judge and filed her first motion to reopen less than 2 weeks after she was ordered removed, we nonetheless conclude that the totality of the circumstances do not establish that her failure to appear at her missed hearing was the result of exceptional circumstance warranting reopening of her removal proceedings. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act; Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, 509 (BIA 1996).
 
We further conclude that the respondent’s case does not warrant sua sponte reopening (Respondent’s Br. at 20-22). Sua sponte authority is invoked sparingly and reserved for truly exceptional circumstances. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-35 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (explaining that sua sponte reopening is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship). While we are sympathetic to the harm the respondent purportedly suffered as a child in Mexico and her fears of return, we do not find that the particular facts in this case demonstrate truly exceptional circumstances warranting sua sponte reopening. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. at 1133-35. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gabriela Parra, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, on April 16, 2018, filed an untimely motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel.1 The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. We find that the respondent has properly asserted a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (Motion at Tab D). See generally Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-640 (BIA 1988). The respondent asserts that but for ineffective assistance of counsel, which he asserts caused him to be removed in absentia, he would have been given the opportunity to voluntarily depart, and would have chosen to do so. Considering the totality of circumstances presented in the motion, and the lack of any opposition to the motion from the Department of Homeland Security, the motion will be granted and the record will be remanded to allow the respondent the opportunity to seek any relief for which he may be eligible. Given the disposition of this matter, we need not further address the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to terminate proceedings is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings not inconsistent with this order and entry of a new decision.

By a supplemental motion filed on July 9, 2018, the respondent seeks the termination of proceedings in light of Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S.Ct. 2105 (2018). The respondent avers that termination is appropriate insofar as the Notice to Appear issued to him on July 3, 2014, did not include the date and time of his prospective hearing before an Immigration Judge. However, a subsequent notice informed the respondent of the date and time of his hearing, September 2, 2015, which is not a matter of dispute. See Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441, 441 (BIA 2018) (Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018), distinguished). Therefore, the motion to terminate these proceedings will be denied.

*1 The Board entered the final administrative decision on August 7, 2015, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s May 30, 2014, written decision denying a previous motion to reopen proceedings in which the respondent was ordered removed to the Dominican Republic in December 1999 because he did not comply with a voluntary departure order. The respondent has filed another motion to reopen, averring that his prior counsel deficiently represented him by not seeking to apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility (Form I-601A) on his behalf in the May 2014 motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland ‘ecurity opposes the motion, which will be denied, as the respondent has not demonstrated that an exception to the time and number limits applies. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent has not meaningfully raised his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, where he has not shown compliance with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), including, inter alia, notification to prior counsel of the alleged deficient representation. Current counsel’s assertion that the respondent contacted prior counsel several unspecified times and informed him of the alleged deficient representation is insufficient. Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (statements of counsel are not considered evidence). Current counsel has provided no explanation why she has not notified prior counsel of the alleged deficient performance. Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2004) (emphasizing importance of Lozada notification requirement, to afford prior counsel an adequate opportunity to respond to the alleged deficient performance). Nor is the purported State of New York Grievance Committee complaint, dated April 10, 2018, adequate notification to the respondent’s former counsel. Taveras-Duran v. Holder, 767 F.3d 120, 123-24 (1st Cir. 2014) (recognizing Board’s discretionary authority to deny motions to reopen for failure to comply with Lozada requirements).
 
The respondent also has not demonstrated the requisite diligence to pursue an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Neves v. Holder, 613 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 2010) (the equitable tolling doctrine extends statutory deadlines only in extraordinary circumstances, where parties were prevented from complying through no fault or lack of diligence of their own); Chedid v. Holder, 573 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 2009) (observing that equitable tolling should be sparingly invoked and is foreclosed where aliens do not exercise due diligence).1 The respondent should have inquired about his potential eligibility for adjustment of status when the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services approved a visa petition on his behalf in 2002 (Respondent’s Mot., tab C). If he had done so then he would have known that a provisional unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility was necessary to apply for adjustment of status when prior counsel filed his motion to reopen in May 2014. Because the respondent waited an additional 4 years since the motion to allege ineffective assistance of counsel, we are not persuaded that he has diligently pursued the claim. Chedid v. Holder, 573 F.3d at 37 (affirming Board’s finding that alien did not act with due diligence, where he waited approximately 1 year to pursue ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
*2 Further, we are not persuaded that prior counsel’s allegedly deficient representation prejudiced the respondent. Muyubisnay-Cungachi v. Holder, 734 F.3d 66, 72 (1st Cir. 2010) (observing that an alien must demonstrate a reasonable probability that counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced him or deprived him of a fundamentally fair hearing). Considering then-applicable regulations, the respondent has not shown that he was eligible for an unlawful presence waiver when prior counsel filed the motion to reopen in May 2014, given the respondent’s final removal order. 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(vi) (2013).
 
Finally, the respondent has not established an exceptional situation warranting sua sponte reopening. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Although we sympathize with his wife’s health issues, we do not have the authority to grant relief from removal solely on equitable grounds. Matter of Silva-Rodriguez, 20 I&N Dec. 448 (BIA 1992).
 
Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

File: AXXX-XX3-309 - Chicago, IL

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven Laxton, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Casey J. Johnson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; termination
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 4, 2000, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On August 16, 2018, almost 18 years after the Board’s order, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, remand, and terminate. The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
We will first address the respondent’s argument that his proceedings should be reopened, his removal order rescinded, and his proceedings terminated, or in the alternative remanded to the Immigration Judge, in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Pereira v. Sessions 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018). The respondent argues that, because the Notice to Appear in his case did not contain a specific date and time of hearing, under Pereira, this document does not constitute a Notice to Appear, jurisdiction over his case did not vest with the Immigration Court, and therefore the removal proceedings against him should be terminated (Moton at 1-2).
 
However, in the respondent’s case, the Notice to Appear did specify the date and time of his hearing, as “February 4, 1998[,] at 9:00 a.m.” as well as the place of his hearing, i.e., the Chicago Immigration Court (Exh. 1). Inasmuch as the Notice to Appear satisfied the date and time requirement addressed in Pereira v. Sessions, the respondent’s arguments seeking termination or remand of the proceedings based on that decision are inapposite.
 
We will next address the respondent’s arguments regarding ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the respondent argues that attorney Gary Spraker, who represented him at hearing and on appeal, provided ineffective assistance because in 1996 he filed an unmeritorious application for adjustment of status for the respondent, for the purpose of obtaining an employment authorization, which was denied by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), and which resulted in the initiation of the removal proceedings against him. The respondent argues that attorney Spraker was disciplined by bar authorities in 2001 for such actions (Motion at 2-4).
 
However, the respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent acknowledges that attorney Spraker was disciplined in 2001, shortly after the completion of the respondent’s proceedings.1 The respondent has not explained how he exercised due diligence in filing a motion to reopen based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim nearly 18 years after the alleged ineffective assistance. See El-Gazawy v. Holder, 690 F.3d 852, 859-860 (7th Cir. 2012).
 
*2 In any event, attorney Spraker’s action now complained of by the respondent was conduct prior to the issuance of the Notice to Appear and therefore outside the removal proceeding, rather than during the removal proceeding itself. Therefore, this conduct did not affect the fairness or outcome of the proceeding itself. To establish a due process violation based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must show, inter alia, that the alleged ineffective assistance prevented him from receiving a fair hearing and that the lack of a fair hearing actually had the potential for affecting the outcome of the proceedings. El-Gazawy v. Holder, 690 F.3d at 860; see also Rapheal v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 521, 533 (7th Cir. 2008); Hamid v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 642, 646-47 (7th Cir. 2005) (applicant’s failure to allege excluded testimony that would potentially affect outcome of hearing was fatal to due process claim).
 
To the extent the purported deficiencies in the attorney’s representation in the case did not pertain to the actual substance of the hearing (e.g., evidence presented or omitted, arguments raised or overlooked), or call the hearing’s fairness into question, the respondent has not shown that reopening is warranted based on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See also Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004), amended sub nom. Lara-Torres v. Gonzales, 404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir. 2005). Furthermore, despite the acknowledgement in the motion regarding Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (Motion at 4), the respondent has not shown that he has complied with the requirements set forth in that decision. Based on the above, the motion based on ineffective assistance of counsel will be denied.
 
The respondent also urges us to sua sponte reopen his proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), based on a number of factors in his case, including the approved Form I-130 visa petition filed by his United States citizen daughter, his long period or residence in the United States and minimal criminal record, and other factors. We do not find that the respondent’s case presents an exceptional situation that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to reopen sua sponte “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). Based on the above, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

The respondent’s motion states that he may have been aided by a class action settlement (Motion at 4, fn. 3; Motion Exh. L). However, this settlement appears to have been entered in or about 2005, long before the current motion was filed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Luciano B. Park, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carolyn Abdenour
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent was ordered removed in absentia in 2005, and the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen on March 16, 2016. On April 20, 2018, the respondent filed the present motion asking the Board to sua sponte reopen these removal proceedings to allow her to apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver (Form I-601A) in conjunction with an application for adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is both time and number-barred and will be denied on that basis. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Moreover, the power to reopen sua sponte allows reopening in exceptional situations not present here. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). The respondent urges that the hardship to her United States citizen spouse upon her removal warrants sua sponte reopening. We acknowledge the challenges that the respondent’s spouse may face, but there appears to be no basis for reopening outside of the time and numerical constraints imposed by law given the present record and the evidence submitted in support of the motion.
 
We only separately note that it is undisputed that the respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear, which contains the date, time, and place of her scheduled hearing. The respondent’s claim that she did not receive proper notice of her hearing was fully considered and addressed by both the Immigration Judge and the Board.1
 
Finally, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(iv), the respondent does not need to have her removal proceedings reopened to be able to pursue a Form I-601A waiver with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). In addition, she may request an administrative stay of removal from the DHS while any waiver, or provisional waiver, applications are pending before the USCIS. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a). Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

To the extent the respondent contends that she received ineffective assistance from former counsel in connection with these removal proceedings below, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for advancing such a claim, including the requirement that she show prejudice resulting from former counsel’s alleged deficient performance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001) (noting that to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate that counsel’s performance resulted in substantial prejudice); Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F. 3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994) (proving prejudice requires the petitioner to make a prima facie showing that, absent counsel’s deficient performance, he would have been entitled to the relief the sought).

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Orlando Mondragon, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Geoffrey D. Rieman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s November 16, 2017, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen her removal proceedings. While this appeal was pending, the respondent also filed another motion to reopen with this Board. The appeal will be dismissed and the respondent’s second motion to reopen is denied.
 
We review the Immigration Judge’s factual findings for clear error, including findings as to the credibility of testimony. We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
On March 2, 2011, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s request for voluntary departure prior to the conclusion of her removal proceedings (IJ at 1, 5-6). See section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b). The respondent did not depart the United States on or before the expiration of her voluntary departure period (IJ at 6). Six years later, on October 5, 2017, the respondent filed a motion to reopen sua sponte. The respondent sought reopening based on her argument that the Immigration Judge failed to ask her if she had a fear of persecution in Mexico. The respondent claimed that she feared persecution in Mexico based on the particular social group of her family. The respondent also sought reopening so that she could submit applications for a U visa and for relief under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). The respondent claimed that her lawful permanent resident husband was emotionally, psychologically, and physically abusive to her and to her children (IJ at 2, 3). See Motion to Reopen Sua Sponte; Addendum to Motion to Reopen at 2.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen on November 16, 2017. The respondent now appeals that decision. Despite indicating on her Notice of Appeal that she intended to file an appeal brief, the respondent did not do so. Instead, she filed another Motion to Reopen and to Terminate Removal proceedings based on the Supreme Court’s decision in Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018).1
 
With regard to the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of her first motion to reopen, in her Notice of Appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by finding that the Digital Audio Recording of the respondent’s March 2, 2011, hearing is intelligible and provides a full and accurate record of the hearing (IJ at 4). The respondent states that she has not been able to “find a playable track” of the hearing. Notice of Appeal at 2. In the Immigration Judge’s November 16, 2017, decision, however, the Immigration Judge set forth a detailed summary of the March 2, 2011, hearing (IJ at 4-6). The respondent was present at the hearing and has not indicated that the Immigration Judge’s summary is inaccurate. In any event, the respondent has not shown that she was prejudiced by this alleged error. See Molina v. Holder, 763 F.3d 1259, 1263 (10th Cir. 2014) (respondent cannot succeed on a due process claim without showing that the alleged error materially affected the outcome of her case).
 
*2 The respondent also argues in her Notice of Appeal that her proceedings should be reopened because she has requested that the Vermont Service Center issue an expedited decision on her U visa application. Notice of Appeal at 2. This Notice of Appeal was filed on November 24, 2017, however, which was almost 1 year ago. The respondent has not provided any indication since then that the Vermont Service Center has issued a decision. Nonetheless, the Board generally lacks authority to reopen proceedings of aliens who are under a final order of removal and who seek relief, such as a U visa, over which the Board has no jurisdiction. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 107 (BIA 2009).
 
Further, the respondent appears to argue that her proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Notice of Appeal at 2. To the extent that the respondent raised this argument before the Immigration Judge in her motion to reopen, she has not attempted to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 261 n.1 (BIA 2007) (matters not raised before the Immigration Judge are waived on appeal).
 
Moreover, the respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge erred by denying reopening so that she can file a self-petition under the VAWA. She claims that she was living with her lawful permanent resident boyfriend and ““being abused by him at the time of her hearing” before the Immigration Judge. Notice of Appear at 2; Addendum to Motion to Reopen at 2-3. Because the respondent alleges that her boyfriend abused her at the time of her hearing, she has not shown that these allegations were unavailable and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent also has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for VAWA relief and that she merits relief as a matter of discretion (IJ at 8). See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 106 (1988); Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 419 (BIA 1996). For these reasons, we uphold the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s first motion to reopen.
 
In addition, as explained above, during the pendency of this appeal, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen based on the Supreme Court’s decision in Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018). In that case, the Supreme Court addressed the narrow issue of whether a Notice to Appear that does not designate a specific time or place of a removal proceeding triggers the stop-time rule which ends the accrual of the alien’s period of continuous physical presence in the United States for purposes of cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1).
 
*3 Here, the respondent relies on Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. at 2119, and argues that, because her September 22, 2009, Notice to Appear did not contain the time or place of a removal hearing, her proceedings should be reopened and she should be permitted to file an application for cancellation of removal (Exh. 1). See Second Motion to Reopen at 3-4.
 
Generally, an alien may file one motion to reopen and it must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceedings sought to be reopened. See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Act. In this case, the respondent has filed two motions to reopen, and the second motion was filed on September 20, 2018, which was not within 90 days of the Immigration Judge’s November 16, 2017, decision. In order to avoid the time and numeric limitations, however, the respondent argues that these limitations should be equitably tolled, or that the Board should reopen the proceedings sua sponte. See Second Motion to Reopen at 5-8.
 
Contrary to the respondent’s argument, this Board recently decided Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441, 447 (BIA 2018). In that case, the Board held that a Notice to Appear that does not specify the time and place of a removal proceedings vests jurisdiction with the Immigration Judge over the removal proceedings and satisfies section 239(a) of the Act as long as a Notice of Hearing setting forth this information is subsequently sent to the alien. See Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. at 447; see also section 239(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a). In this case, it is undisputed that the respondent appeared for her master calendar hearing on November 24, 2010, and for subsequent hearings. Therefore, the respondent received notice of the time and place of her removal hearings. For these reasons, consistent with Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. at 447, the respondent has not established that reopening is warranted on account of a lack of notice. Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated that an exceptional situation exists which calls for sua sponte reopening. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). For these reasons, we deny the respondent’s second motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s Motion to Reopen and Terminate Removal Proceedings is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Cheryl Lin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order of removal in the respondent’s case on February 5, 2008. The respondent now moves the Board to reconsider our March 5, 2018, decision denying her untimely, number-barred motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). She specifically challenges the Board’s decision not to reopen the proceedings sua sponte to enable her to apply for adjustment of status. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The motion will be denied.
 
This Board has limited authority to reopen and reconsider cases sua sponte in truly exceptional situations. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999). However, “[t]he power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship.” Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). The respondent asserts that she did not seek sua sponte reopening to cure filing defects. Rather, she requested reopening sua sponte “because it took may years for [her] to become eligible to adjust status [] because [h]er son [] became a permanent resident in 2007 and a naturalized citizen in 2011” (Respondent’s Mot. at 8). We emphasize that becoming potentially eligible for relief many years after the entry of a final order of removal is not an “exceptional situation” warranting sua sponte reopening.
 
The respondent also asserts that the Board should reconsider our decision because we noted in a footnote that she could apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver before the USCIS. She essentially asserts that she is not prima facie eligible for such relief because she is separated from her husband who is her sole qualifying relative for the waiver. We find no error in our footnote to warrant to reconsideration. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
In sum, the respondent has not identified an error of fact or law in our prior order to warrant reconsideration of our denial of her untimely, number-barred motion to reopen.1 See section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). We recognize that the respondent has acquired equities in the United States, and that her removal will likely result in hardship to the respondent and her family. Nevertheless, the respondent’s prior motion did not demonstrate an exceptional situation to persuade the Board to exercise its sua sponte discretion in this matter.2 Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

To the extent that the respondent offers evidence with the instant motion, such evidence has not been shown to comply with the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).

2

The respondent now asserts that she is not removable as charged in the Notice to Appear. The respondent, however, did not raise this issue on appeal or in a prior motion to reopen. Motions to reopen and reconsider are not opportunities to present previously available evidence or to raise arguments that could have been raised on appeal. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 n.2 (BIA 1991) (discussing the characteristics of motions to reopen and motions to reconsider). To the extent that the respondent implies that her prior attorney incorrectly conceded the charge set forth in the NTA, she has not established that the filing restrictions imposed on motions to reopen before the Board should be equitably tolled. The respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, nor demonstrated that she exercised due diligence in bringing this matter before the Board. See Fadiga v. Attorney Gen. U.S., 488 F.3d 142, 157 (3d Cir. 2007); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).

IN RE: DIEGO LUCAS-MOLINA
File: AXXX-XX7-340 - Phoenix, AZ
October 2, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eric G. Bjotvedt, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Edith M. Lucero
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Administrative closure; remand; termination
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 17, 2017. The respondent has submitted a motion to remand and a motion to terminate. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has submitted a motion for summary affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision and has opposed the respondent’s motion to terminate. The appeal will be dismissed and the motions will be denied.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
In the Notice of Appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for administrative closure, and suggests that he should have been granted administrative closure because he was not an enforcement priority and there was a new administration at the time of his final hearing (Notice of Appeal at 2). However, the respondent has not explained or shown, before the Immigration Judge or on appeal, that these are sufficient reasons for administrative closure under Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012), overruled by Matter of Castro-Tum, 27 I&N Dec. 271 (A.G. 2018). In any event, since the Immigration Judge’s decision, the Attorney General ruled in Matter of Castro-Tum, 27 I&N Dec. 271, that Immigration Judges and the Board do not have the general authority to suspend indefinitely immigration proceedings by administrative closure, subject to certain exceptions that are not applicable here. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent has submitted a motion to remand, showing that he has married a spouse who has filed for a U nonimmigrant status and therefore he may qualify as a derivative beneficiary of a U visa if this application is approved (Motion to Remand Exhs. A-D). However, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has sole jurisdiction over all petitions for U nonimmigrant status, rather than the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1). Furthermore, the respondent is not precluded from seeking a U visa from the USCIS by the fact that he is the subject of a final order of removal.1 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1)(ii). Accordingly, the motion to remand based on the U visa application will be denied.
 
*2 In the motion to remand, the respondent has submitted an asylum application and argues that the right to apply for asylum was not explained to him at hearing (Motion to Remand Exh. E). The respondent states that he fears returning to Guatemala because he is a native Mayan and has experienced social discrimination and limited educational, economic, and other opportunities (Motion to Remand Exh. E, Form I-589 at 5). However, the respondent was represented at hearing by an attorney, who indicated that the respondent was advised of his immigration rights (Tr. at 14). The respondent has submitted a declaration stating that he was never advised of the possibility of asylum (Motion to Remand Exh. F). However, the respondent has not made a valid ineffective assistance of counsel claim by complying with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and he has not explained why he could not do so. Accordingly, the motion to remand for asylum application will be denied.2
 
In the motion to terminate, the respondent argues that his proceedings should be reopened, his removal order rescinded, and his proceedings terminated, in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018). The respondent argues that, because the Notice to Appear in his case did not contain a specific date and time of hearing as the Notice to Appear in Pereira, this document does not constitute a Notice to Appear, jurisdiction over his case did not vest with the Immigration Court, and therefore the removal proceedings against him should be terminated.
 
However, the Supreme Court’s decision did not hold that a Notice to Appear that did not contain a specific date and time of hearing was invalid for all purposes or did not validly initiate removal proceedings. Rather, the Supreme Court focused on the specific question whether such a Notice to Appear triggers the stop-time rule for purposes of cancellation of removal. Section 240A(d)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(d)(1)(B). Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. at 2113 (stating that “the dispositive question in this case is much narrower ...: Does a “notice to appear” that does not specify the “time and place at which the proceedings will be held” . . . trigger the stop-time rule?”). Therefore, the Supreme Court’s decision does not warrant termination of the respondent’s proceedings.
 
In Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441 (BIA 2018), the Board held that a notice to appear that does not specify the time and place of an alien’s initial removal hearing vests an Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over the removal proceedings and meets the requirements of section 239(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a), so long as a notice of hearing specifying this information is later sent to the alien. For the reasons set forth in Matter of Bermudez-Cota, we will deny the respondent’s motion to terminate.
 
*3 The Immigration Judge granted a 60-day period of voluntary departure to the respondent. The respondent submitted proof on appeal that the voluntary departure bond has been posted, therefore the period of voluntary departure will be reinstated. Based on the above, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motions are denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

While the pendency of an application for a U visa has no effect on the government’s authority to execute a removal order, an applicant for a U visa is permitted to file a request for a stay of removal with the DHS. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1)(ii). If the USCIS approves the respondent’s application, the regulation allows him to file a motion to reopen and terminate proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(5)(i).

The respondent also has not argued or shown that the past or future social discrimination and lack of opportunities he describes may rise to the level of persecution or torture.

IN RE: CLAUDIA SANCHEZ A.K.A. EBLIN IBANIA MURILLO CASTRO
File: AXXX-XX0-471 - Harlingen, TX
September 21, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mo Idlibby, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Guillermo Rey De La Garza
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 5, 2018, denying her motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for her failure to appear for a hearing on June 27, 2005. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact. The Immigration Judge found that the Notice to Appear (NTA) was personally served on the respondent on November 13, 2004, and contained the date, time, and location of the respondent’s June 27, 2005, hearing (IJ at 1; Exh. 1). Further, the Immigration Judge observed that the certificate of service on the NTA indicates that the respondent was provided oral notice in her native language of Spanish of the consequences of a failure to appear, and the respondent’s right index fingerprint is affixed thereto (Id.). Moreover, the NTA bears the respondent’s signature. Consequently, inasmuch as the respondent was personally served with the NTA containing the date, time, and location of her hearing, we conclude that the respondent received proper notice of her hearing. See Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 185 (BIA 2001) (stating that the entry of an in absentia order is authorized when the alien has been given written notice of the removal hearing); see Cruz-Diaz v. Holder, 388 F. App’x 429 (5th Cir. 2010); see also Chavez v. Holder, 343 F. App’x 955 (5th Cir. 2009); see Ojeda-Calderon v. Holder, 726 F.3d 669, 675 (5th Cir. 2013) (“Due process allows notice of a hearing to be given solely in English to a non-English speaker if the notice would put a reasonable recipient on notice that further inquiry is required.”). Nevertheless, the respondent did not appear, and the Immigration Judge ordered her removed in absentia.
 
On appeal, the respondent claims she has demonstrated exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. She claims that her attorney advised her not to appear at the immigration hearing and that he would take care of things for her (Respondent’s Brief).
 
*2 We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an ““exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. A motion to reopen alleging exceptional circumstances for a failure to appear at a removal hearing must be filed within 180 days of the order of removal, and only one such motion is allowed. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i) & 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent’s motion claiming that she did not appear at her hearing because of ineffective assistance by her former counsel, was untimely, as it was filed well beyond 180 days after the removal order was entered. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case lies, has recognized that equitable tolling may apply in “rare and exceptional circumstances,” United States v. English, 400 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir. 2005), and that a party seeking to toll a filing deadline must demonstrate diligence, Pacheco v. Rice, 966 F.2d 904, 906-07 (5th Cir. 1992).1
 
In Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016), the Fifth Circuit instructed the Board to apply the same equitable tolling standard that the court uses in other contexts, stating that under this standard, “a litigant is entitled to equitable tolling of a statute of limitations only if the litigant establishes two elements: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently; and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.” Id. The Fifth Circuit explained further that the first element requires the litigant to establish that he pursued his rights with “reasonable diligence” and the second element requires the litigant to establish that an “extraordinary circumstance” beyond his control prevented him from complying with the applicable deadline. Id.
 
The respondent is not entitled to equitable tolling because she has not established that she has pursued her rights with reasonable diligence and that an extraordinary circumstance beyond her control prevented her from complying with the applicable deadline. The respondent has not indicated that she attempted to determine the status of her case with the Harlingen Immigration Court during the passage of over 13 years after she was ordered to appear in court in June 2005, nor that she consulted with any other attorneys between 2005 and 2018. The respondent also has not established that an extraordinary circumstance beyond her control prevented her from complying with the applicable deadline. We conclude that the respondent has not established that she is entitled to equitable tolling in this matter. See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d at 344.
 
*3 Further, we also conclude that the respondent has not established an exceptional circumstance herein to warrant the sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. The respondent’s purported eligibility for adjustment of status does not constitute an exceptional situation. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “the power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). The respondent was personally served with a NTA listing the time and place of her hearing and she was provided oral notice of her hearing date and the consequences of failing to appear (Exh. 1). The respondent has not established what efforts she took to determine the status of her removal proceeding after receiving the NTA almost 13 years before she filed her motion to reopen. We therefore decline to reopen proceedings sua sponte. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rev. John J. Garkowski, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Guillermo Rey de la Garza
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s October 11, 2017, decision. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen filed on August 29, 2017, seeking rescission of an in absentia order of deportation that was entered on March 22, 1996. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed an opposition to the motion, and has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An order of deportation issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to former section 242B(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed with the Immigration Judge either within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation if the alien demonstrates that he failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances (8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(1)) or at any time if the alien demonstrates she did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because she was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of her own (8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(2)).
 
The Order to Show Cause (OSC) was personally served on the respondent on December 31, 1995; the notice of hearing (NOH) was served by certified mail, and the record contains a signed receipt for the NOH (IJ (unpaginated); Exhs. 1, 3). Because the respondent received notice of her hearing, her motion to rescind was subject to the 180-day time limit, and the motion was untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(1). Moreover, the respondent took no action during the last 20 years to assert this claim for reopening and she has not explained why she waited until 2017 to file a motion to reopen. Her lack of diligence supports the conclusion that reopening is not warranted as a matter of discretion.
 
On appeal, the respondent also maintains that she is eligible to adjust her status because her U.S. citizen spouse has filed a petition on her behalf, which has been approved (Respondent’s Br. at 1). The formal rescission requirements need not be satisfied in certain circumstances where the respondent is eligible for relief that was unavailable at the time of the in absentia hearing and did not receive oral warnings in his/her native language regarding the bar to future discretionary relief that arises from a failure to appear. See generally Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). However, the respondent received oral warnings in her native Spanish language (Exh. 1). In addition, the respondent’s in absentia deportation order was entered on March 22, 1996, and therefore, the motion was also filed long past the 90-day deadline for the filing of a motion to reopen seeking new relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b).
 
*2 Additionally, the DHS has amended the rules regarding provisional unlawful presence waivers to permit individuals with final removal orders to apply for provisional unlawful presence waivers in certain instances. See Expansion of Provisional Unlawful Presence Waivers of Inadmissibility, 81 Fed. Reg. 50,244, 50,275-76 (July 29, 2016); 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e) (4) (iv). Thus, the respondent does not need to have her removal proceedings reopened to be able to apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The respondent may request an administrative stay of removal from the DHS while any waiver or provisional waiver applications are pending before USCIS. 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a).
 
The respondent argues that she relied upon the advice of counsel telling her that once she paid bond and was released, immigration authorities were no longer interested in her (Respondent’s Br. at 1). However, the respondent has not identified that attorney; nor has she complied with any of the requirements to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
We find without merit the respondent’s appellate contention that she did not understand the proceedings because she did not understand English (Respondent’s Br. at 1). The OSC and Notification Requirement for Change of Address each contained instructions in both English and Spanish (Exhs. 1, 4).
 
While the respondent contends that her country conditions have worsened (Respondent’s Br. at 2), she has proffered no evidence to support that assertion. See Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013) (holding that removal proceedings conducted in absentia may be reopened where the alien seeks asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions); see also Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247, 258 (BIA 2007) (explaining that it is the alien’s heavy burden to show that the proffered evidence is material, reflects changed conditions arising in the country of nationality, and supports a prima facie case for a grant of asylum).
 
While we sympathize with the respondent for wanting to remain in the United States after living here for many years, the Board is not empowered to grant relief from removal solely on equitable or humanitarian grounds. See Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734, 742 (BIA 1988).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: ELIZABETH MARIA ESTEVEZ DE MARTINEZ A.K.A. ELIZABETH M. LANDA
File: AXXX-XX1-305 - New York, NY
August 27, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael A. Areizaga, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On February 26, 2018, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen proceedings in which the Board dismissed her appeal on August 25, 2009. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely because it was filed more than 8 years after the Board’s final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). It is also number-barred, as it is the respondent’s second motion to reopen. However, the respondent contends that the attorney who represented her before the Immigration Judge provided her with ineffective assistance because he did not inform her that she could pursue a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(d)(11) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(11), or that her husband could file a visa petition on her behalf, and because he did not provide briefing or evidence in this regard (Motion, Tab A at 2-3). Matter of Compean, 21 I&N Dec. 51 (BIA 1995). She also seeks sua sponte reopening. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
The noted statutory time and number limitations may be excused if a respondent demonstrates that she had ineffective assistance of counsel. Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 130 (2d Cir. 2008); Jin Bo Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154, 159-60 (2d Cir. 2006); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent contends that she has substantially complied with the procedural requirements for such a claim, as enumerated in Matter of Lozada (Motion at 7; Tab A). However, to warrant equitable tolling the respondent also must “demonstrate ... that [she] has exercised due diligence in pursuing [her claim].” Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 135 (2d Cir. 2000). In addition, she must demonstrate that she was prejudiced by counsel’s actions; i.e., that ““counsel’s performance was so ineffective ... [that it] impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing in violation of the Fifth Amendment due process clause.” Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d 879, 882 (2d Cir. 1994).
 
In determining whether the respondent exercised due diligence, we consider ““whether and when the ineffective assistance ‘[was], or should have been, discovered by a reasonable person in the situation.’ Then, petitioner bears the burden of proving that [she] has exercised due diligence in the period between discovering the ineffectiveness of [her] representation and filing the motion to reopen.” Jian Hua Wang v. BIA, 508 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d at 134). The respondent must demonstrate that she exercise “due diligence” in pursuing her claim “during the entire period [she] ... seeks to toll.” Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d at 132.
 
*2 The respondent has not demonstrated that she exercised the requisite due diligence. The record reflects that the Immigration Judge continued proceedings on April 9, 2007, so that the respondent could file a visa petition package with the court (Tr. at 184-87). However, when the hearing convened almost 5 months later, no visa petition had been filed (Tr. at 191-92). Moreover, the record reflects that there was extensive discussion at her hearing about the respondent’s eligibility to file for adjustment of status, and pursue a waiver of inadmissibility (Tr. at 192-211). As such, the respondent was aware that she could pursue both adjustment and a waiver as of the time of her December 20, 2007, hearing.
 
In arguing that she exercised due diligence, the respondent notes that she retained a different attorney to file and brief her appeal. Although this attorney did not raise any arguments pertaining to her eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility, the respondent has neither alleged, nor perfected, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against him. Twum v. INS, 411 F.3d 54 (2d Cir. 2005). This is true despite the fact that the DHS specifically raised the issue of whether the respondent was eligible for a section 212(d)(11) waiver of inadmissibility in its brief on appeal (DHS Br. at 18). Although she indicates that this attorney did file a visa petition on her behalf which was ultimately granted, the respondent has not detailed the representational agreement she had with him, as required (Motion, Tab C). Id. She also has not explained what, if any, actions she took with respect to her claim following the Board’s 2009 adverse decision.1 As such, we find that she has not demonstrated the requisite due diligence. Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d at 135.
 
In addition, the respondent has not demonstrated that she was prejudiced by counsel’s actions, as required. To demonstrate prejudice, or to otherwise succeed on a motion to reopen, the respondent must establish a prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief sought; i.e., adjustment of status and a section 212(d)(l 1) waiver of inadmissibility. See Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d at 882-83; see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104 (1988). In dismissing the respondent’s appeal, the Board upheld the Immigration Judge’s alternate basis for denying her application for adjustment of status, in the exercise of discretion (BIA at 3, ftnt. 1; IJ at 14). The record reflects that the Immigration Judge found the respondent not credible, and that she had lied to federal agents, a District Court judge, and the Immigration Judge (IJ at 7-14). The respondent has neither addressed, nor rebutted, the Immigration Judge’s findings. As both adjustment of status and a waiver of inadmissibility are discretionary forms of relief, the respondent has not shown that she was prejudiced by former counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance.
 
*3 In closing, we recognize that the respondent has alternatively asked that her proceedings be reopened sua sponte, citing various humanitarian factors in this regard (Motion at A, pgs. 1-5). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). However, an individual’s acquisition of equities after remaining in the United States for many years, and the resulting hardships to that person spouse or children, following a removal order are, unfortunately, common situations. The authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte, however, is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The respondent bears the burden to show exceptional circumstances supporting sua sponte reopening. See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000). As the respondent has not met her burden in this case, sua sponte reopening is not warranted.
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

The respondent also argues that she was diligent in pursuing her claim as the visa petition filed on her behalf remained pending until it was approved on July 2, 2015. However, the fact that a visa petition was pending, without more, is insufficient to demonstrate due diligence. We also note that there is no evidence that respondent’s second counsel was involved in the filing of this visa petition, as the notice was addressed to the petitioner, her husband, and not former counsel. Furthermore, the respondent had not explained what action she undertook since the visa petition was approved, until the filing of the instant motion, with respect to her claim.

IN RE: FRANCIS ANTONIO COLLADO REYES
File: AXXX-XX2-347 - Boston, MA
August 21, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey B. Rubin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated July 19, 2017, finding the respondent removable as charged. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent became a lawful permanent resident of the United States in 1994. In May of 2011, he left the United States for the Dominican Republic due to the death of his mother. He argues he intended to stay there 1 month, but due to grief and depression he remained there over 1 year, attempting to return on September 14, 2012. At this time, he attempted to enter the United States with a fraudulent stamp in his passport indicating he had not been absent from the United States for this length of time. The Immigration Judge found the respondent lacked credibility and had abandoned his lawful permanent resident status (IJ at 9-10). The respondent and his attorney were provided a deadline to file any applications for relief and they did not meet it (IJ at 11). On appeal, the respondent argues he was credible and appeared less so due to memory issues and that he did not abandon his lawful permanent resident status (Respondent’s Br. at 7-11). He also claims he did not commit fraud and did not abandon his applications for relief. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994).
 
Generally, to gain admission into the United States, an immigrant must present a valid, unexpired immigrant visa as well as a valid, unexpired passport or other travel document. See section 211(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1181(a). If a person fails to produce such documents, he or she is deemed inadmissible under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).
 
When an applicant for admission has a colorable claim to returning resident status, the Department of Homeland Security bears the burden to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant’s status has changed and he or she is not eligible for admission. See Katebi v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 463 (1st Cir. 2005); Matter of Huang, 19 I&N Dec. 749, 753 (BIA 1988); see also Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276 (1966); Matter of Rivens, 25 I&N Dec. 623 (BIA 2011). In order to qualify as a returning resident alien, an alien must be returning to an unrelinquished lawful permanent residence after a temporary visit abroad. Matter of Huang, 19 I&N Dec. at 749. A temporary visit abroad is one that is “relatively short, fixed by some early event, or” that “will terminate upon the occurrence of an event having a reasonable possibility of occurring within a relatively short period of time.” Katebi v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d at 466, quoting Chavez-Ramirez v. INS, 792 F.2d 932, 936-37 (9th Cir. 1986).
 
*2 The required intent is not one of ultimately returning to the United States, but, rather, an intent to return to a residence in the United States within a relatively short period of time from a temporary visit abroad. Katebi v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d at 466. The definition of “temporary” is not inflexible and varies in application depending upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case and is not defined in terms of elapsed time alone. See Katebi v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d at 466. Rather, the intention of the alien, when it can be ascertained, will control. Id.; Matter of Kane, 15 I&N Dec. 258 (BIA 1975). We have in the past ascertained an alien’s intention by examining the location of family ties, property holdings, and employment. Matter of Muller, 16 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1978); Matter of Quijencio, 15 I&N Dec. 95 (BIA 1974); see also Katebi v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d at 710.
 
The Immigration Judge’s findings regarding both the respondent’s intent in relation to his return to the United States and his life in the Dominican Republic are factual in nature. Thus, we review them for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We conclude the Immigration Judge’s factual findings are not clearly erroneous. The respondent first testified that he had no memory of when he left the United States and then stated that he left the country for, at the most, 1 month (Tr. at 42-71). Over a year later, he again appeared in Immigration Court, but this time he testified that he had left the United States for Puerto Rico due to the death of his mother and had remained there for over 1 year (Tr. at 110-18). He also recalled giving a friend his passport to have a date stamped in it indicting that he had been out of the United States for a shorter length of time (Tr. at 121-24). The Immigration Judge found this directly contradictory testimony to support an adverse credibility determination (IJ at 9-10).
 
The respondent argues he has memory problems, and was suffering from depression and stress due to the death of his mother (Respondent’s Br. at 7-9). He has submitted some documents supporting this claim and he takes medicine for the depression and memory (Exhs. 6, 7). The Immigration Judge considered this evidence but concluded it was not sufficient to overcome the adverse credibility determination (IJ at 9-10). The respondent’s mother died in 2011 and the hearing, when he first testified to not remembering his trip, was in 2014.1 The Immigration Judge is permitted to make reasonable inferences among the plausible possibilities and explanations for discrepancies in the record and he did so. See Matter of D-R-, 25 I&N Dec. 445, 455 (BIA 2011) (explaining that an Immigration Judge may make reasonable inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence in the record as a whole and is not required to accept respondent’s account where other plausible views of the evidence are supported by the record). There is no clear error in the Immigration Judge adverse credibility determination.
 
*3 Given this lack of credibility, the Immigration Judge did not credit the respondent’s claim that he had no intention of remaining in the Dominican Republic for as long as he did (IJ at 10). Although the respondent has children and grandchildren in the United States, he also has many relatives in the Dominican Republic. He testified to having no steady employment or property in the United States and to having paid no taxes since 2007 (IJ at 10). The record provides clear and convincing evidence that the respondent abandoned his lawful permanent resident status in the United States. See Katebi v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d at 466. Although the respondent testified that he intended to return to the United States within 1 month (Tr. at 111), an alien’s professed intent to return to the United States without more is not sufficient to support his claim. Matter of Huang, 19 I&N Dec. at 755. We acknowledge the respondent’s argument that his situation is different than the one found in Katebi (Respondent’s Br. at 11). Each case must be reviewed on its own facts, and, here, the Immigration Judge applied the appropriate standard.
 
In 2015, the respondent attempted to enter the United States with a fraudulent stamp in his passport indicating that he was not out of the country for as long as he had been (IJ at 10-11). He testified that a friend took his passport away from him for several days and obtained the stamps (Tr. at 121-23). No clear error exists in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent was not credible when he claimed he did not know the stamp was fraudulent (IJ at 10-11). We affirm the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent is removable as charged.
 
We further affirm the Immigration Judge determination that the respondent abandoned any applications for relief by not filing them in a timely manner (IJ at 11). The respondent was represented by an attorney from 2013 (Tr. 15), and both the respondent and his attorney were clearly informed of the August 1, 2016, deadline for filing any applications for relief (Tr. at 180-90). A new attorney took over representation on August 1, 2016, but no applications for relief were filed (IJ at 11). Although, at a hearing represented by the new attorney, the parties discussed the applicability of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (Tr. at 211), no attempt has been made to comply with the requirements it lays out for motions based on ineffective assistance of counsel (IJ at 11). The respondent testified that his conflict with his previous attorney was over the fees he was being charged (Tr. at 217). The respondent has not presented good cause for failing to timely file any applications for relief (Respondent’s Br. at 13-14).
 
The Immigration Judge properly found that the respondent, by not complying with the filing deadline provided, abandoned his opportunity to apply for relief (IJ at 11). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c); Moreta v. Holder, 723 F.3d 31, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2013); Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992); see also Matter of Interiano-Rosa, 25 I&N Dec. 264, 265-66 (BIA 2010) (concerning late filed documents). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*4 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: GENESIS DOLLANA CIFUENTES-LOPEZ
File: AXXX XX6 032 - Dallas, TX
July 27, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christi J. Giddeon, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s January 11, 2018, decision denying her December 21, 2017, motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia after she did not appear for a scheduled removal hearing on July 18, 2017. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded only if the alien files a motion to reopen: (1) within 180 days after the date of the removal order in which he establishes that the failure to appear was because of “exceptional circumstances,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(e)(1); or (2) at any time where the alien establishes that she did not have proper notice of the hearing at which the removal order was entered. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act.
 
The respondent concedes that her attorney of record received proper notice of her July 18, 2017, hearing. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2. The respondent states in an affidavit that she did not receive a notification of the hearing that her attorney sent to her by mail and that she learned of the hearing at which she was ordered removed when she appeared at the Immigration Court on August 3, 2017, which she thought was her current hearing date. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 8. The respondent filed her motion to reopen on December 21, 2017.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings. Service on the respondent’s attorney of record constitutes proper service of a hearing notice. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c)(2), 1292.5(a); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985). The Immigration Judge therefore correctly concluded that reopening under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act is not warranted as notice was proper in this case. The respondent’s motion to reopen suggests that the attorney may have sent the hearing notice to an incorrect address. See Motion to Reopen at 2 ¶ 3 (stating that the attorney erred in sending the motion to 3608 rather than 3608½ NW 13th Street). However, the respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel or complied with any of the procedural requirements for establishing such a claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent alleges in her affidavit that she frequently experiences problems with her mail, but did not submit any evidence of this assertion and did not promptly file a motion to reopen upon learning that she had been ordered removed in absentia. Cf. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 666 (BIA 2008). We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen where the respondent did not establish that notice was improper or that exceptional circumstances existed excusing her failure to appear. See sections 240(b)(5)(C), (e)(1) of the Act.
 
*2 We further affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request that proceedings be reopened sua sponte as the respondent has not shown that exceptional circumstances are present in this case. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that sua sponte reopening is an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional circumstances). We note that the respondent may continue to seek an immigration benefit based on an approved visa petition from outside of the United States with the appropriate waivers. For the aforementioned reasons, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDEN
 
Tina Y. Song, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rod Wolthoff
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, has appealed the Immigration Judge decision dated March 5, 2018, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for her failure to appear for the hearing on October 31, 2002. The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear was served personally on the respondent on August 14, 2002, and the respondent received oral, in the Spanish language, and written notice of the consequences of a failure to appear and of the requirement to notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever she changed her address or telephone number during the proceeding (Exh. 1). The notice of hearing was sent to the address provided by the respondent and it was not returned to the Immigration Court as undeliverable by the postal service. The respondent did not appear for the hearing on October 31, 2002, and the Immigration Judge issued an in absentia order of removal.
 
There is a receipt presumption for notices sent by regular mail, which “is weaker than that accorded to notice sent by certified mail.” Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 673 (BIA 2008). We consider all relevant evidence, including circumstantial evidence, offered to rebut the presumption. Relevant factors include the following: “(1) the respondent’s affidavit; (2) affidavits from family members or other individuals who are knowledgeable about the facts relevant to whether notice was received; (3) the respondent’s actions upon learning of the in absentia order, and whether due diligence was exercised in seeking to redress the situation; (4) any prior affirmative application for relief, indicating that the respondent had an incentive to appear; (5) any prior application for relief filed with the Immigration Court or any prima facie evidence in the record or the respondent’s motion of statutory eligibility for relief, indicating that the respondent had an incentive to appear; (6) the respondent’s previous attendance at Immigration Court hearings, if applicable; and (7) any other circumstances or evidence indicating possible nonreceipt of notice.” Matter of M-R-A, 24 I&N Dec at 673-74.
 
*2 The Immigration Judge correctly determined that based on all of the evidence in this matter, the respondent has not rebutted the weaker presumption of delivery (IJ at 2).1 See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 674-75; see also Li v. Holder, 402 Fed. Appx. 923, 924 (5th Cir. 2010) (holding that an alien’s failure to provide a current address precludes the alien from obtaining rescission of an in absentia order of removal). Specifically, as noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent did not provide an affidavit or any other evidentiary material stating that she did not receive the notice of hearing (IJ at 2). Moreover, the respondent did not show that she had an incentive to appear at her hearing. In addition, the notice of hearing was sent to the most recent address provided by the respondent and was not returned by the postal service as undeliverable. Furthermore, the respondent waited over 15 years, until after she became eligible for an alternative form of relief, to file a motion to reopen. These factors outbalanced her claim that she did not receive any notice.
 
Regarding the respondent’s request to reopen to adjust her status based on an approved I-130 visa petition, in Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998), the Board held that an alien may reopen for purposes of pursuing previously unavailable relief in circumstances where she was not given oral warnings in her native language of the consequences of failing to appear at a deportation hearing and where the motion complies with the general time limits governing motions to reopen. See also Matter of Monges, 25 I&N Dec. 246 (BIA 2010). Neither condition is satisfied here.
 
To the extent that the respondent is alleging ineffective assistance by her former attorney, we note that she has not complied with any of the evidentiary requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).2 See also Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948, 953 (5th Cir. 2012) (court requires strict Lozada compliance). Moreover, the respondent has not established that she was prejudiced by her former counsel’s actions. See De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir. 2004) (noting that “an alien must make an initial showing of substantial prejudice” to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
To the extent that the respondent has submitted new evidence with her appeal, we generally cannot consider any new evidence proffered on appeal. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). The additional documentation here is not sufficiently material so as to warrant a remand for its consideration.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

On appeal the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by applying a strong presumption of the delivery of the notice of hearing (Respondent’s Br. at 3). However, a review of the record indicates that the Immigration Judge properly determined that the respondent did not rebut the weaker presumption of delivery (IJ at 2).

Under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 637, a motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be supported by an affidavit, reflect whether a complaint had been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and include a response to the allegations by former counsel or report counsel’s failure or refusal to respond.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
CM Boston Cote, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on January 16, 2018, when we dismissed the respondents’ appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of their applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture and declined to remand their proceedings for voluntary departure or adjustment of status. The respondents have filed a timely motion to reconsider and request for a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The motion and stay will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondents’ motion is both a motion to reconsider and a motion to reopen. A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based upon the previous factual record, whereas a motion to reopen seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57-58 (BIA 2006). Here, the respondents challenge the decisions of the Board and the Immigration Judge and additionally allege ineffective assistance of their former counsel.
 
We first address that aspect of the motion requesting reconsideration. A party seeking reconsideration requests that the original decision be reexamined in light of alleged legal or factual errors, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. at 56; Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). Here, the respondents largely raises the same or similar arguments in the motion to reconsider as were raised in their prior appeal brief. We considered those arguments and found them unpersuasive when viewed within the record as a whole before we dismissed their appeal and denied their motion to remand. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. at 58 (stating that “a motion to reconsider is not a process by which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief presented on appeal . . .”). Disagreement with the result is not sufficient. Therefore, the motion to reconsider is denied.
 
The respondents’ motion is also in the nature of a timely motion to reopen. Applicable regulations provide that a motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, a movant must satisfy the “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must show that competent counsel would have acted otherwise and that the alien was prejudiced. See Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 To the extent that the respondents are attempting to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, they have not complied with any of the Lozada1 procedural requirements. See Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87, 94-95 (BIA 2007) (finding that the alien satisfied the concerns underlying the Lozada requirements by complying with the first two steps). Regardless, the respondents have not demonstrated that they were prejudiced by their prior counsel’s actions or inactions. See Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605, 609 (5th Cir. 2006) (rejecting claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on failure to pursue a discretionary waiver of relief from removal).
 
The respondents seek reopening to apply for adjustment of status or voluntary departure. However, the respondents are not eligible to adjust under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1155(a), as they were not inspected and admitted into the United States (see Exh. 1; IJ at 1-2). Moreover, despite the assertions in their motions, the respondents are not charged as arriving aliens (Compare Motion at with Exh. 1). Therefore, even if the visa petition is ultimately approved, the respondents would need to seek a provisional waiver of their unlawful presence in anticipation of consular processing. As we noted in our previous decision, such a waiver could be sought without reopening the proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(iv). Further, as we mentioned in our prior decision, the respondents are not eligible for voluntary departure because they were not present in the United States for 1 year immediately preceding the issuance of the Notice to Appear (Decision of the Board, at 1). See section 240B(b)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(1)(A); Matter of Arguelles, 22 I&N Dec. 811, 816 (BIA 1999).
 
As there is no relief immediately available to the respondents in reopened removal proceedings, they have not demonstrated prejudice from counsel’s actions or omissions such that they have established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. As such, the respondents’ motion is insufficient to meet their “heavy burden” of showing that it is likely that the result would change if the proceedings were reopened. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. at 464. Therefore, we do not find that they have met their burden of showing that reopening of these proceedings is warranted.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

IN RE: SALEH ALI AL-ASHMALI
File: AXXX XX9 378 - Charlotte, NC
July 11, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Fleta Christina Sabra
Accredited Representative
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Susan Lecker
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 In a decision dated January 9, 2018, the Board upheld an Immigration Judge’s decision denying in discretion the respondent’s application for a fraud waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H). The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen these proceedings. To the extent that he challenges our last decision, his motion is also in the nature of a timely motion to reconsider. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991) (providing that the nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard). The respondent has also filed a request for a stay of removal, which we denied in an order issued on June 26, 2018.1 The motions to reopen and reconsider, which remain pending and are opposed by the Department of Homeland Security, will be denied.
 
In the instant motion, the respondent argues that the Board and the Immigration Judge overlooked evidence pertaining to conditions in his native country of Yemen that would be adverse to his family, medical evidence of one of his United States citizen children, and other factors relevant to discretion (Motion to Reopen at 8-15, 36-44). He also accuses the Immigration Judge of bias by “t[aking] over much of the questioning,” and claims that the Immigration Judge unfairly “orchestrated the consequence where [his] and his ex-wife’s cases would be heard [together].” (Id at 19, 51).2
 
The respondent further argues that reopening is warranted based on ineffective assistance of former counsel, and that the Board erred in finding that he failed to comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for raising such a claim on his direct appeal (Motion to Reopen at 29-36, 52-55). He accuses former counsel of (1) committing an ethical violation by discussing his case “ex parte” with the Immigration Judge and DHS counsel outside of his presence; (2) coaching him to lie at his hearing and then ridiculing him to the Immigration Judge; (3) failing to submit evidence pertaining to one of his United States citizen child’s Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD); and (4) refusing to make the respondent’s criminal attorney accountable for allowing him to plead guilty to a crime that, unbeknownst to him, would have adverse immigration consequences (Id. at 15-25, 27-39).
 
Ultimately, the respondent wishes to seek reopening to apply for cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a), as well as protection under the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16-1208.18.3
 
*2 To the extent the respondent seeks reconsideration of our last decision, he has failed to identify any error of fact or law in our decision that would warrant its reconsideration. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 56-58 (BIA 2006). We are satisfied that the Immigration Judge and the Board fully and properly reviewed the respondent’s case under the applicable legal precedents. While we acknowledged his numerous positive equities in our last decision, we remain persuaded that the respondent’s significant adverse factors - namely, his numerous false statements to the DHS and to the Immigration Court to obtain immigration benefits over a 15-year period, outweigh his positive equities (Board decision dated Jan. 9, 2018, at 2-3). The respondent does not merit discretionary relief.
 
Moreover, upon review of the record, we are unpersuaded that the Immigration Judge was biased against the respondent or otherwise conducted the hearing in a manner that did not comport with due process. See section 240(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(1) (giving immigration judges authority to ““interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien and any witnesses”); Rusu v. INS, 296 F.3d 316, 321-22 (4th Cir. 2002) (providing that alien must be ““accorded an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner, i.e., ... [to] receive a full and fair hearing on [her] claims”). The Immigration Judge’s conduct during the hearing fell short of displaying a ““deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible [.]” Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994).
 
We are also unpersuaded that reopening is warranted based on ineffective assistance of counsel. To prevail on such a claim, in addition to complying with certain procedural requirements, an alien must demonstrate that he was prejudiced as a result of his counsel’s ineffectiveness. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 640 (holding that alien must also show that she was prejudiced by counsel’s actions). The respondent has made no such showing here.
 
Initially, we are unpersuaded that the respondent’s former counsel committed any ethical violations by discussing the case with the Immigration Judge, in DHS counsel’s presence, at the conclusion of the proceedings. As an officer of the court, the respondent’s former counsel would have been subject to discipline for knowingly and with reckless disregard offering false evidence. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.102(c). The respondent continued to perjure himself throughout these proceedings, after the original fraud he committed before the DHS during his adjustment and naturalization processes (I.J. at 18; Tr. at 29.58. 222). Apparently, he perjured himself without former counsel’s urging or knowledge that he would do so (See Motion to Reopen. Attached E-Mail from Patrick Taurel dated Dec. 8. 2016. in which Taurel responded to the allegations against him). Once the respondent admitted to his continued perjury, we find it not only reasonable, but also incumbent upon former counsel, to have notified the Immigration Judge that he was unaware that his client was making false statements during his testimony. It is also not uncommon for an Immigration Judge to discuss an alien’s case with his counsel, along with DHS counsel, outside of the respondent’s physical presence.
 
*3 We also do not find that the respondent was prejudiced by former counsel’s failure to offer evidence of his child’s ADD. There is no indication that this evidence would likely have affected the outcome of these proceedings. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464. 473 (BIA 1992).
 
Moreover, the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s alleged failure to confront the respondent’s criminal counsel about any substantive or procedural defects of his plea in his criminal case. There is no indication that former counsel in these proceedings was retained for that purpose or agreed to assist the respondent in that regard. The respondent has also admitted in these proceedings that he committed the immigration fraud to which he ultimately pled guilty in his criminal proceedings.
 
As a final matter, we decline to reopen these proceedings to permit the respondent to pursue cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents or protection under the Convention Against Torture. The respondent has not shown his prima facie eligibility for either form of relief, such that reopening of these proceedings would be warranted.
 
Because the respondent committed fraud to procure adjustment of status, he is not an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for cancellation purposes. See 240A(a)(1) of the Act; see also Matter of Koloamatangi, 23 I&N Dec. 548, 551 (BIA 2003) (holding that an alien was ineligible for cancellation of removal for lawful permanent residents because he was “deemed, ab initio, never to have obtained lawful permanent resident status once his original ineligibility therefor [was] determined in [removal] proceedings”D’).
 
The respondent has also failed to make a prima facie showing that he will more likely than not face harm amounting to torture by or with the consent or acquiescence (including willful blindness) of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity, in the Yemeni government upon his repatriation. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16-1208.18. The respondent generally alleges that he will be tortured in Yemen because his brother and cousin were killed by Houthi rebels after the respondent informed United States immigration officials that Houthi rebels were attending his mosque (Petition For Convention Against Torture filed Feb. 9, 2018, Attached Form I-589 & Accompanying Affidavit). The respondent’s generalized and conclusory statements in this regard are insufficient, without more, to make out a prima facie showing that he is eligible for protection under the Convention Against Torture. We acknowledge the difficult country conditions in Yemen, but evidence of adverse country conditions, without more, is insufficient to show that the respondent himself may more likely than not be tortured upon his repatriation. See generally 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16-1208.18.
 
*4 In view of the foregoing, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent has also filed a separate “motion to expedite” wherein he complains about conditions in his current detention facility that are adversely impacting his state of health. However, the Board and the Immigration Judges have limited jurisdiction and can grant only those forms of relief from removal that are expressly authorized by Congress. See Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734 (BIA 1988). We do not have any authority to instruct the DHS how to operate their detention facilities. To the extent that the respondent may be seeking a bond determination, we note that bond proceedings are separate and apart from removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(d). Any request for bond would have to be made in a separate proceeding.

The respondent’s ex-spouse, Hana Al-Barati (AXXX XXX XXX), is presently in separate removal proceedings. However, she testified on his behalf in these proceedings.

The respondent also alleges that he is eligible for suspension of deportation under former section 244(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254 (Brief in Support of Cancellation of Removal filed Feb. 16, 2018, at 9-13). However, the respondent is ineligible for suspension of deportation, which was abolished in 1996, because such relief is unavailable for aliens who, like the respondent, are in removal proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Armineh Ebrahimian, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Evagelia Stella Solomos
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of China, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s February 7, 2018, decision denying his motion to continue and deeming his application for asylum abandoned and requests that the record be remanded to the Immigration Judge to file his application for asylum. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge properly deemed the respondent’s claim for asylum abandoned (IJ at 3-4). See Makir-Marwil v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 681 F.3d 1227, 1235 (11th Cir. 2012) (“If an application for relief is not filed by the deadline set by the IJ, that ground for relief is deemed waived.”); Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). The Immigration Judge adequately informed the respondent of the opportunity to file for asylum and the consequences of failure to timely file the application (IJ at 3-5; Tr. at 3-4, 7). As further discussed below, the respondent did not establish a persuasive basis for not timely filing his application.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion for a continuance. An Immigration Judge “may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. The respondent sought a continuance to find a new attorney (Tr. at 8-9). The Immigration Judge noted that the Department of Homeland Security opposed a continuance (IJ at 5). Despite the respondent’s counsel’s failure to appear for the hearing, the respondent, through a Mandarin interpreter, was advised of the consequences of not filing his asylum application by February 7, 2018, and confirmed that he understood (Tr. at 3-4, 7).1 The respondent was also served with a hearing notice advising him of the same (IJ at 3-4; Jan. 10, 2018, Hearing Notice). The respondent appeared at his February 7, 2018, hearing without an application for relief. While the respondent claims he was unaware of his former counsel’s motion to withdraw, he indicated that he was looking for another attorney, and the Immigration Judge noted that a letter from his sponsor indicated the same (IJ at 4; Tr. at 7-8). Moreover, the respondent acknowledged his understanding of the consequences for failure to file an asylum application by February 7, 2018 (IJ at 3-5; Tr. at 3-4, 7). Under these circumstances, the respondent had not established that “good cause” existed to further continue these removal proceedings (Id). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 815 (BIA 2012) (recognizing that a continuance should not be granted where it is being sought “as a dilatory tactic to forestall the conclusion of removal proceedings”); see also Matter of Castro-Turn, 27 I&N Dec. 271, 287 (A.G. 2018) (noting regulatory authorization for continuances).
 
*2 Moreover, the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by the continuance denial, as he has not shown that he is prima facie eligible for asylum, and has not submitted an application for asylum on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (a motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation). Therefore, the respondent has not demonstrated that the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny him a continuance was in error or that he experienced prejudice as a result. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983) (noting that an alien must show that the denial of the continuance caused actual prejudice).
 
Likewise, the respondent’s request for a remand to apply for asylum is denied. Despite his claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel, the respondent does not persuasively explain why he could not timely filed his application before the Immigration Judge. Moreover, as noted above, he has not supported his request for a remand with his asylum application, and thus, he has not established prima facie eligibility for asylum. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); see also INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988); Najjar v. Ashcroft, 257 F.3d 1262, 1303 (11th Cir. 2001); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Therefore, we are unable to conclude whether any application for asylum is reasonably likely to succeed on the merits. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349, 357 (BIA 1998). Thus, the record will not be remanded.
 
Finally, to the extent the respondent asserts that his due process rights were violated in the proceedings below, we are unpersuaded. The respondent did not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in the admission of his application for asylum after the court-ordered deadline had run. See Tang v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 578 F.3d 1270, 1276 (11th Cir. 2009). Further, the respondent has not established that he suffered prejudice such that the outcome of these proceedings may have been affected by the Immigration Judge’s decision. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We do not address the merits of the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because the respondent did not comply with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).

We note that, despite the respondent’s claim of not receiving the Immigration Judge’s decision, the record shows that the respondent was served with the Immigration Judge’s summary order deeming the asylum application abandoned and ordering him removed to China, as well as being informed of his right to appeal the decision (Tr. at 10-12).

File: AXXX XX0 313 - Dallas, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 4, 2017, denying her motion to reopen removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on May 12, 2014. On August 11, 2014, the respondent through her former counsel, Mr. Mario Caballero, filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge alleging that she did not receive notice of her May 12, 2014, hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion in a decision dated November 28, 2014, finding that the respondent’s failure to appear at the May 12, 2014, hearing was due to her failure to provide an updated address with the Immigration Court. On June 28, 2017, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a second motion to reopen alleging that her new motion was subject to equitable tolling based on exceptional circumstances in the form of Mr. Caballero’s ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge denied the motion in a decision dated August 4, 2017, finding that while the respondent may have pursued her rights diligently, extraordinary circumstances were not present in this case because the respondent did not meet her burden of proof to show that Mr. Caballero’s representation was ineffective (IJ at 3).
 
On appeal, the respondent specifically contends that her former attorney, Mr. Caballero, provided ineffective assistance of counsel to her because he based the respondent’s first motion on an improper ground, i.e. a lack of notice claim (Respondent’s Br. at 4-5, 9-10). The respondent therefore argues that her second motion, filed more than 90 days after the entry of the final administrative order on May 12, 2014, should be equitably tolled based on extraordinary circumstances in the form of ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Br. at 7-10).
 
Generally, an alien may file one motion to reopen, which must be filed within 90 days after the entry of the final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Under the doctrine of equitable tolling the 90-day filing deadline can be excused if the respondent establishes that: 1) she has been pursuing her rights diligently, and 2) some extraordinary circumstance stood in her way and prevented a timely filing. Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016).
 
*2 Ineffective assistance of counsel may constitute extraordinary circumstances. See, e.g., Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). However, we agree with the Immigration Judge that equitable tolling is not warranted in this case because no extraordinary circumstances exist in the form of ineffective assistance of counsel (IJ at 3). The respondent did not fully comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), in order to reopen her proceedings based upon her claim of Mr. Caballero’s ineffective representation (IJ at 4-5). Specifically, the respondent’s affidavit did not set forth in detail the representation agreement she had with her former counsel (id.). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639 (requiring a motion to reopen to be “supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel...”) (emphasis added). The documents that the respondent alludes on appeal to do not attest in detail to the facts of the representation agreement at issue and only summarily explain that she retained Mr. Caballero to file a motion to reopen (Respondent’s Br. at 11-13; Respondent’s Second Motion to Reopen-Tabs E, J).
 
Furthermore, even if the respondent had met the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel in an immigration proceeding, the respondent must demonstrate “substantial prejudice” resulting from counsel’s performance. Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n. 2 (5th Cir. 2001). Proving prejudice requires that the petitioner make a prima facie showing that, absent counsel’s deficient performance, she would have been entitled to the relief she sought. Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994). The respondent has not met her burden of showing that she was prejudiced by actions from his prior attorney.
 
Although the respondent contends that her prior attorney did not submit an application for withholding of removal with the respondent’s motion to reopen, the respondent has not shown that she was prima facie eligible for withholding of removal (Respondent’s Br. at 10). To that end, although the respondent submitted an application for withholding of removal with her Second motion to reopen, the application is blank in a number of places, does not indicate upon what basis she is seeking withholding of removal, and did not include an affidavit from the respondent setting forth the basis of her claim for relief (IJ at 6; Respondent’s Second Motion to Reopen-Tab K).
 
*3 The respondent contends that a reasonable attorney would not have based a motion to reopen on the respondent not having received notice of the May 12, 2014, hearing as it should have been based on exceptional circumstances or on the Immigration Judge’s power to reopen a case sua sponte (Respondent’s Br. at 12). However, the respondent does not advance what those exceptional circumstances would have been. The respondent did not appear for her May 12, 2014, hearing because she did not update her address with the Immigration Court, which led to her not receiving notice of the hearing (IJ at 5; Respondent’s Br. at 4, 10)). As the Immigration Judge noted, this does not constitute an exceptional circumstance and the respondent’s motion is untimely (IJ at 3, 5). Further, we agree with the Immigration Judge that based on the totality of the circumstances, the respondent had not presented a truly exceptional situation that would have warranted sua sponte reopening (IJ at 5-6). Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
We disagree with the respondent’s contention that the Immigration Judge conflated his legal analysis regarding equitable tolling with the procedural and substantive requirements of a Lozada claim (Respondent’s Br. at 8). The Immigration Judge separately considered whether the respondent had complied with the Lozada requirements, and then considered whether the respondent had made out a prima facie case for relief.
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey B. Rubin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Shayne R. Burnham
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Haiti, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of December 4, 2017, denying the respondent’s November 1, 2017, motion to reopen removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia on February 9, 2001. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a reply opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent’s November 1, 2017, motion was the second one filed in these proceedings, it was filed over 16 years after she was ordered removed in absentia, and the Immigration Judge correctly found that the motion was time and numerically barred (IJ at 2). See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C) (providing that there is no deadline for rescinding an order entered in absentia where the issue is notice, and that an alien has 180 days to file a motion where the nonappearance was based on exceptional circumstances).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that she is eligible for equitable tolling of the time limits because she was misled by a person posing as a lawyer. However, the respondent has not shown that she complied with the requirements for bringing such a claim, as laid out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (1988). In particular, nothing in the record indicates that the respondent: (1) filed an affidavit setting forth the agreement that was entered into with this person with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations this individual did or did not make to her in this regard; (2) informed the former attorney or person of the allegations leveled against him/her; or (3) filed a complaint with any appropriate disciplinary authority. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273 & n.6 (11th Cir. 2005) (explaining the Lozada requirements).
 
We find no merit to the respondent’s contention that since it was a non-attorney involved, she need not fulfill the Lozada requirements. See Montano Cisneros, 514 F.3d 1224, 1227 (11th Cir. 2008). Moreover, as the respondent raised the same issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in her October 29, 2001, motion and in his March 13, 2002, decision, the Immigration Judge found the respondent had not fulfilled the Lozada requirements, we agree with the DHS that the law of the case doctrine applies to the respondent’s repeated ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See United States v. Amedeo, 487 F.3d 823, 829 (11th Cir. 2007) (courts may readily dispose of repetitive, meritless claims that present the same claim already denied in a prior claim by applying the law of the case where appropriate).
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: YERICIA NICOL ORTIZ-NUNEZ
File: AXXX XX4 227 - Miami, FL

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Beresford A. Landers, Jr., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Angel L. Fleming
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s October 29, 2017, decision denying her motion to reconsider. The respondent sought reconsideration of the Immigration Judge’s October 2, 2017, decision denying her motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order dated August 24, 2017. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal. The appeal will be sustained.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On December 2, 2016, the respondent, 13 years of age at the time, appeared before the Immigration Judge with present counsel. At the conclusion of that hearing, the Immigration Judge rescheduled the respondent’s case for a later date and waived the respondent’s appearance at future proceedings so that she could attend school (Dec. 2, 2016, Hearing Tr.). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.25(a). Counsel’s presence was not waived. The respondent’s case was ultimately rescheduled for August 24, 2017 (Mar. 7, 2017, Notice of Hearing). The respondent’s counsel did not appear for this hearing, and the Immigration Judge entered an in absentia removal order. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i).
 
The respondent filed a motion to reopen on August 29, 2017, claiming that reopening is warranted based on “exceptional circumstances.” Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. Although not explicitly framed as such, the exceptional circumstance relied on by the respondent is ineffective assistance of counsel. See Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir. 2008) (providing that ineffective assistance of counsel may amount to an exceptional circumstance). The respondent states that the proceedings should be reopened and the removal order rescinded due to counsel’s failure to appear at the hearing (Respondent’s Br.), which counsel claims resulted from unforeseen travel delays on the date of the hearing.
 
In an October 2, 2017, decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, concluding, without additional explanation, “no exceptional circumstance for the respondent’s failure to appear.” (Emphasis added). On October 19, 2017, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider pointing out the fact that the respondent herself was not required to attend the hearing because her presence had been excused.1 See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.25(a). In an October 29, 2017, decision, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reconsider, explaining that “neither the respondent nor counsel were present” at the hearing and that “no exceptional circumstance” had been established. The present appeal ensued.
 
*2 A motion to reopen or reconsider based on ineffective assistance of counsel requires “(1) an affidavit . . . detail[ing] the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken . . ., (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities . . . and if not, why not.” Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 637 (BIA 1988). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has found it reasonable to demand an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel to substantially comply with these procedural requirements. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005); Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir. 2003).
 
The motion to reopen is supported by an affidavit from counsel, detailing the circumstances surrounding his failure to appear at the hearing. Furthermore, counsel’s failure to appear at the hearing, which amounts to deficient performance, is plain on the face of the administrative record. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000) (“[W]here ‘the facts are plain on the face of the administrative record, the requirements of Lozada are not dispositive.”D’ (citation omitted)), as quoted in Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d at 1222. There is no dispute that counsel missed a hearing he was scheduled to appear at and, in doing so, caused the respondent to be ordered removed in absentia at a hearing she herself was not required to attend. While we share in the dissent’s point that counsel should have self-reported his conduct to relevant bar authorities to satisfy the bar complaint requirement under Matter of Lozada, there is no indication of collusion between the minor respondent and counsel in this case. See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 604 (BIA 1996) (noting that the purpose of the bar complaint requirement is to “protect against possible collusion between counsel and the alien client”). On this record, the purpose of Matter of Lozada is sufficiently satisfied.
 
The ineffectiveness of the respondent’s counsel in this case constitutes an exceptional circumstance and was the cause of the respondent’s failure to appear. The respondent, thus, met her burden of establishing that rescission of the in absentia order and reopening of proceedings were warranted.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The August 24, 2017, in absentia order is rescinded, this matter is reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.
 
Joan B Geller
FOR THE BOARD
DISSENTING OPINION: Garry D. Malphrus, Board Member
The issue addressed by the majority--whether counsel’s absence from the hearing constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel--was neither presented to nor considered by the Immigration Judge. As this argument was not advanced below, the proper procedure for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has not been followed. See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 637 (BIA 1988). In particular, there is no indication that relevant bar authorities have been alerted of counsel’s conduct in missing the hearing. See id. (providing that a motion claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must “reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities . . . and if not, why not”).
 
This bar complaint requirement serves the important purpose of “protect[ing] against possible collusion between counsel and the alien client.” Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 604 (BIA 1996). I do not believe, even in jurisdictions that permit only substantial compliance with the requirements under Matter of Lozada, that an attorney should be permitted to bypass this requirement by simply admitting error. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir. 2003) (providing that substantial compliance with the requirements under Matter of Lozada is permissible only “where their purpose is fully served by other means”).
 
For these reasons, I respectfully dissent. I would remand the record for the Immigration Judge to address the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in the first instance under Matter of Lozada.

The DHS continues to represent on appeal, as it did in its opposition to the motion to reopen, that it “has no record of the respondent’s presence being waived” (DHS’s Br. at 3). The digital audio recording of the December 2, 2016, hearing clearly reflects that the respondent’s presence was waived.

IN RE: MARLON JOSE MORENO-SUNSIN
File: AXXX XX2 645 - Miami, FL
June 20, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Irving Joseph Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Evagelia Stella Solomos
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On January 9, 2008, an Immigration Judge entered an in absentia order of removal. On December 6, 2017, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. On January 8, 2018, an Immigration Judge denied the motion. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.1
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent argued that he relied upon the advice of someone at his former attorney’s office that he should not appear at the January 2008 hearing (IJ at 2). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had received notice of the hearing, but was arguing that he had failed to appear due to ineffective assistance of counsel (IJ at 3 & n.3). The respondent does not challenge this characterization of events on appeal. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not complied with any of the three requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) to establish ineffective assistance of counsel (IJ at 3). On appeal, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge relied on the lack of a bar complaint in rejecting his ineffective assistance ot counsel claim (Respondent’s Br.).2
 
However, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not fulfill any of the three requirements, not only the third requirement relating to the filing of a bar complaint. The respondent does not address the other two requirements, i.e., that he provide an affidavit detailing the agreement entered into with counsel and that counsel be informed of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond. As the respondent does not identify any error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent did not comply with each part of Matter of Lozada, we conclude there is no reason to disturb that portion of the decision. The respondent’s motion is untimely and unexcused. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent emphasizes his desire for sua sponte reopening. In 2013, the respondent married a United States citizen and he argues that he has an exceptional situation in that his wife has documented mental health problems (Respondent’s Br.). Moreover, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should have reopened and administratively closed the proceedings so that the respondent could adjust his status through a waiver before the agency (Respondent’s Br.).
 
Administrative closure is no longer appropriate in most circumstances. Matter of Castro-Tum, 27 I&N Dec. 271 (A.G. 2018). Moreover, the couple married after the respondent was in removal proceedings and had an order entered against him, and thus this outcome cannot be said to be an extraordinary circumstance. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (Board’s discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). For the above reasons, we decline to exercise our sua sponte authority. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 107 (1988) (“[M]otions to reopen are disfavored in deportation proceedings . . . [because] [t]here is a strong public interest in bringing litigation to a close as promptly” as possible.).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joanna Golding, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Luciana Dubuc
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on October 15, 2015, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision on July 28, 2014, which denied her motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia on November 29, 2011. On February 8, 2018, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen and reconsider our prior decision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a response in opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely. The Board entered the final administrative order in these proceedings on October 15, 2015. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), with certain exceptions not pertinent here, a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion to reopen until February 8, 2018 (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen and Reconsider (Motion)). The respondent has not shown that an exceptional situation exists that would warrant the Board’s exercise of discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
The respondent contends that she filed the instant motion to reopen because she identified substantial issues relating to proper notice and improper representation by prior counsel (Motion). The respondent asserts that she intends to pursue all possible relief and to supplement the motion with evidence of her eligibility for relief warranting reopening in this matter (Id.).
 
On October 15, 2015, the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge determination that the respondent received proper notice of her hearing held on November 29, 2011, and that she had neither alleged nor demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel (Board Dec. at 1-2). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988). The respondent’s instant motion raises the same issues that we considered and decided in our decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen proceedings following the entry of in absentia order of removal (Id.; Motion). See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), (ii).
 
*2 The respondent did not demonstrate any error in our prior decision (Motion). She did not establish that her failure to appear at her scheduled immigration hearing was due to ineffective assistance of counsel or that she was prejudiced by her prior counsel’s performance (Id.). In her motion, the respondent states that she intends to submit new evidence to support her motion and general contention that she is eligible for relief (Id.). However, she has only submitted one new document, a Form I-797, Notice of Action, dated February 22, 2016, which indicates that she filed a Form I-918 petition for U nonimmigrant status. She has not submitted any other applications for relief. The respondent has not established that she is currently eligible for any relief from removal. The respondent has not established she did not receive proper notice of her hearing in 2011 or that her failure to appear at the hearing was beyond her control. See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016) (an alien must establish that he pursued his or her rights with “reasonable diligence” and that his failure to appear was beyond his control); Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33, 36 (BIA 1998) (even where the exercise of due diligence is not a statutory requirement for reopening an in absentia deportation order, an alien’s lack of diligence may be a “factor that undercuts” the proffered explanation for the alien’s failure to appear at a scheduled immigration hearing).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN RE: IRVIN JOSIMAR URBINA-MORALES
File: AXXX XX9 928 - Atlanta, GA
June 7, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William Rounds, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of October 20, 2017, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia on February 7, 2017. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Contrary to the respondent’s appellate contention, notice on the respondent’s attorney constitutes notice to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c)(2), 1292.5(a); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien).
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that he never received notice of his hearing from his former counsel. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), are satisfied. Here, however, the respondent in his motion to reopen did not allege ineffective assistance by his former counsel. To the extent the respondent now on appeal alleges ineffective assistance by former counsel, he has not complied with any of the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639. Specifically, the respondent has not submitted an affidavit describing the facts and his agreement with his former counsel, nor has he provided any evidence that his former counsel has been made aware of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond, either after or before he filed his brief to the Board, nor did he indicate that a disciplinary complaint had been filed against his prior attorney. Consequently, the respondent has shown no error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen.
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge that no exceptional circumstances have been presented to warrant sua sponte reopening. The respondent has not explained why his previous counsel was unable to contact the respondent, he has conceded in his motion that he moved to California, and while he alleges he tried to call the Immigration Court, there is no evidence in the record that the respondent filed a written change of address with the Immigration Court.1 Pursuant to our holding in Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), the power to reopen sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: YOLVER ESTRADA-MENDOZA YOLBER MENDOZA ESTRADA
File: AXXX XX9 566 - San Diego, CA
May 31, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas D. Nelson, Esquire
 
AMENDED DECISION
 
*1 ORDER:
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 21, 2017, which found that he had abandoned his opportunity to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1), but granted his request for voluntary departure. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion denied.
 
The record shows that during the September 8, 2016, hearing the Immigration Judge explained to the respondent and counsel that he set a deadline of December 7, 2016, for the filing of the application (IJ at 1-2; Tr. at 31). During the next hearing, the Immigration Judge extended the deadline and advised the respondent and counsel that his application must be filed no later than March 17, 2017 (IJ at 1-2; Tr. at 39-40). In his June 21 2017, decision, the Immigration Judge observed that no application had been filed and deemed it abandoned (IJ at 1-4). For the reasons provided in the written decision, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination to deem the application abandoned (IJ at 1-4). 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1003.31(c). On appeal, the respondent, through counsel, concedes that the application was not filed with the Court, but explains that “counsel has committed a mistake,” and counsel seeks to take full responsibility for the failure to file (Respondent’s Brief at 5). To the extent the respondent is alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, we find no “substantial compliance” with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Castillo-Perez v. I.N.S., 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000), Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.1
 
Turning to the respondent’s motion to reopen, we construe it as a motion to remand because it was filed during the pendency of this appeal. Although the respondent has finally submitted a copy of the application with his motion, the motion is denied. This Board is an appellate body charged with reviewing determinations made by Immigration Judges. We discern no error by the Immigration Judge in deeming the application abandoned. Further, the respondent has not met his heavy burden or demonstrated prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1992) (explaining that a party who seeks a remand or to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case).
 
*2 FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248 and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maria Janossy, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s December 28, 2017, decision that denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent reiterates that he demonstrated exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “““exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), are satisfied. Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 596 (9th Cir. 2004) (considering an alien’s claim that ineffective assistance of counsel qualifies as an exceptional circumstance warranting rescission of an in absentia order); Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, 337 F.3d 892 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that alien established that his failure to appear was due to his reasonable and justifiable reliance on the advice of his attorney’s agent, such that alien was entitled to rescission of in absentia removal order on basis of exceptional circumstances). Upon our de novo review, we conclude that based upon the totality of the circumstances in this case the respondent has met the burden of demonstrating exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear and thereby his November 16, 2017, in absentia order of removal is rescinded. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i).
 
Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lisette Cardo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Todd Keller
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s December 6, 2017, decision denying her motion to reopen the removal proceedings and to rescind an in absentia removal order issued on March 24, 2006. In conjunction with the appeal the respondent has filed documentary evidence relating to her asylum claim under section 208(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1)(B), which we construe as a motion to remand. The Department of Homeland Security has filed a motion for summary affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion to remand will be denied.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including credibility findings, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On November 10, 2005, the respondent was personally served with a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) ordering her to report for a hearing at the Immigration Court in San Antonio, Texas, at a date and time to be set, and she was advised in her native language, Spanish, of her obligation to inform the Immigration Court of her address (IJ at 1; Exh. 1 at 2). The respondent did not report an address. A hearing was scheduled at the San Antonio Immigration Court for March 24, 2006. The respondent did not appear for the hearing on March 24, 2006, and was ordered removed in absentia on that date. On July 22, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and change venue, which was denied. On November 16, 2017, the respondent filed a “Motion to Rescind [the] In Absentia Removal Order and to Reopen Removal Proceedings Pursuant to Sua Sponte Authority.” The respondent sought reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel, changed country conditions, and based on the Immigration Judge’s sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings.
 
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing or was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 723 (BIA 1999). Exceptional circumstances include serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of an immediate relative of the alien, but not less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act. Under certain circumstances, the filing deadline for a motion to reopen may be subject to equitable tolling. See, e.g., Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337 (5th Cir. 2016).
 
*2 As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent did not comply with the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). While we acknowledge that those requirements are not in every case mandatory, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish that the attorney whom she asserts rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in fact represented her at the relevant time (IJ at 4). Furthermore, she has not otherwise complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, in particular the requirement that prior counsel be informed of the asserted ineffective assistance. As such, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s arguments on appeal that the Immigration Judge should have granted equitable tolling of the time and motion deadlines on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. In any event, such ineffective assistance of counsel would only relate to the first motion, not to the respondent’s failure to appear at her scheduled hearing. We conclude, for the reasons given by the Immigration Judge, that equitable tolling on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is not warranted in this case (IJ at 4-5).
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish changed country conditions as a basis for reopening. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had not submitted information regarding relevant conditions in El Salvador in 2006, and therefore did not provide a meaningful basis for comparison with conditions in 2017, when her most recent motion was filed (IJ at 6). Furthermore, she did not corroborate a significant aspect of the claimed change, namely that gang members were now targeting members of the church to which she belongs, the Episcopal Church (IJ at 6). In view of the foregoing, the respondent has not met her burden to establish a basis for reopening based on changed country conditions pursuant to section 240(C)(7)(c)(ii) of the Act; see generally Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247 (BIA 2007).
 
Further, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s claim that the Immigration Judge erred in declining to reopen proceedings sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not provided evidence of circumstances that would justify the extraordinary remedy of reopening her removal proceedings sua sponte. See, e.g., Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (holding that discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that sua sponte reopening is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
*3 The respondent has submitted evidence on appeal. Upon review of the evidence, we decline to remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge to consider this evidence, as the evidence has not been shown to affect the outcome of this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
The following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

File: AXXX XX1 044 - Phoenix, AZ
May 14, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Benjamin T. Wiesinger, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 16, 2017, denying her second motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia on May 5, 2010. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
As an initial matter, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and numerically barred, inasmuch as it was not submitted within 90 days of the Immigration Judge’s May 5, 2010, decision and is the respondent’s second motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b).
 
We are unpersuaded by the respondent’s argument that the numerical bar should be equitably tolled on the basis that she was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel who filed her prior motion to reopen. Although the respondent complied with the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), she did not establish that her former attorney’s actions were actually prejudicial to her case. See id. at 640; see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent was present in Court when the Immigration Judge issued the May 3, 2010, filing deadline for any application for relief and informed the parties of the consequences of failing to meet the deadline. The respondent did not seek or identify voluntary departure as a form of relief, and when she failed to submit an application for cancellation of removal, the Immigration Judge properly deemed her application abandoned and issued a removal order on May 5, 2010. The respondent did not file her first motion to reopen until nearly seven years later. In the interim, she did not maintain contact with her attorney, assumed that her removal proceedings may have been administratively closed, and failed to inquire with the Court regarding the status of her case. Such actions were not reasonable and do not warrant tolling of the filing deadline for the seven year period until her first motion to reopen was filed in May 2017. Regardless of any deficiencies in the respondent’s first motions, they were untimely filed. The respondent has not demonstrated that any of her motions to reopen should have been equitably tolled, as she has not established that the outcome of her proceedings may have been affected by the ineffective assistance she allegedly received. Thus, the respondent did not establish actual prejudice due to the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793-94 (9th Cir. 2005). In light of the foregoing, we conclude that a remand for further consideration of this issue is not warranted.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: MARIO SALVADOR SORIANO-MENDOSA
File: AXXX XX9 818 - Salt Lake City, UT

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jesus E. Saucedo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Saida Ulle
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals the Immigration Judge’s July 11, 2017, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal. A motion to reconsider filed by the respondent with the Immigration Judge prior to the respondent’s filing of this appeal has been forwarded with the record for our consideration.1 The Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) motion to accept its late-filed brief is granted. The respondent filed a request for a stay of removal with the Board. The appeal will be dismissed, the respondent’s motion will be denied, and the request for a stay of removal will be denied.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An order of removal entered in absentia may only be rescinded under the following conditions: 1) if filed within 180 days after the date of entry of the final order of removal, if failure to appear was based on exceptional circumstances; or 2) if filed at any time if the alien did not receive notice. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i), (ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), (ii). On appeal, the respondent argues that exceptional circumstances, namely, ineffective assistance of counsel, justify reopening his removal proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 2, December 29, 2017). Alternatively, the respondent requests that proceedings be reopened sua sponte to allow the respondent to seek adjustment of status through his U.S. citizen wife (Respondent’s Br. at 2, December 29, 2017).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen for the reasons stated therein (IJ at 4-6). Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872 (BIA 1994). While the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent has not demonstrated that equitable tolling applies, as he has not shown due diligence in pursuing his claim (IJ at 4). Moreover, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances, as he has not met the substantive requirements of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (IJ at 4-5). Finally, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent has not shown prejudice, as he did not demonstrate that counsel’s actions foreclosed any available relief (IJ at 5). We address the following in light of the arguments raised by the respondent on appeal.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in holding that he did not exercise due diligence in seeking to reopen his case (Respondent’s Br. at 16-20, December 29, 2017; Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider at 13-15). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish that he exercised due diligence in seeking reopening, where the respondent sought reopening over 5 1/2 years after being ordered removed in absentia. See Mahamat v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1281, 1283 (10th Cir. 2005) (an alien must also show that he exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll); Riley v. INS, 310 F.3d 1253, 1258 (10th Cir. 2002) (ineffective assistance of counsel may toll the filing period for a motion to reopen). The respondent was ordered removed on September 29, 2011, and his motion to reopen was filed on May 24, 2017 (IJ at 4). The respondent admits that he was aware that he missed his hearing date almost immediately, as his attorney called him on the day of the hearing from court to ask him when he would arrive (IJ at 4; Respondent’s Motion, tab B at 6). The respondent states that he met with attorneys in July 2012, February 2013, April 2013, summer 2013, April 2014, and at some point after that, the respondent obtained current counsel (IJ at 4; Respondent’s Motion, tab B at 6-7). In his motion, the respondent states that he met with current counsel in 2014, filed a Freedom of Information Act request, and it was not determined that the respondent had a potential ineffective assistance of counsel claim until March 2017, 2 months prior to filing a motion to reopen (IJ at 4; Respondent’s Motion at 6).
 
However, in his affidavit, the respondent states that as early as May 2011, his attorney’s “lack of competence” was becoming an issue (Respondent’s Motion, tab B at 5). Despite this, the respondent states that he was not aware that his prior attorney had done anything wrong until meeting with current counsel (Respondent’s Motion, tab B at 7). As noted by the Immigration Judge, merely consulting with attorneys, many of whom told the respondent that they would assist him in stopping the execution of his removal order, without further pursuing legal assistance to reopen his case, is not sufficient to demonstrate that he had been diligent during the entire period he seeks to toll (IJ at 4; Respondent’s Motion, tab B at 6-7). Moreover, even assuming the respondent was not aware of the possibility of ineffective assistance of counsel until meeting with current counsel, without further explanation, the respondent has not established due diligence when it took nearly 3 years to file a motion to reopen after apparently retaining counsel (IJ at 4; Respondent’s Motion, tab B at 7). Thus, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated that he acted with due diligence in pursuing his alleged ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
 
*3 On appeal, the respondent further argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he did not meet his burden to establish exceptional circumstances, as he has not shown that counsel’s assistance was ineffective (Respondent’s Br. at 6-8, February 9, 2018; Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider at 11-12). Despite the respondent’s assertions, even assuming that the respondent has met the due diligence requirement, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not shown that ineffective assistance of counsel caused him to miss his hearing (IJ at 4-5). As noted by the Immigration Judge, the record reflects that the respondent was in court when notice of the September 29, 2011, hearing was provided to him and to his attorney in person (IJ at 4). See 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a) (providing that whenever an alien is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to attorney of record); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the alien). In light of this, the respondent was provided proper notice in accordance with section 239(a)(2) of the Act. See section 239(a)(2) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.13, 1003.18. However, the respondent argues that even if notice was proper for his September 29, 2011, hearing before the Immigration Judge, prior counsel did not exercise sufficient professional competence to ensure the respondent’s appearance for his hearing, which caused him to miss his hearing (Respondent’s Br. at 6, February 9, 2018).
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s arguments on appeal. Despite receiving proper notice of his September 29, 2011, hearing on May 26, 2011, the respondent stated that he contacted former counsel on September 5, 2011, asking him to keep him informed as to any upcoming hearing dates (IJ at 4-5; Respondent’s Motion, tab B at 5). The respondent further states that he never heard back from counsel as to when his next hearing was (IJ at 4-5; Respondent’s Motion, tab B at 5-6). As such, the respondent’s argument is essentially that he failed to receive proper notice from his attorney as to his hearing date and therefore, he failed to appear. However, as noted above, the respondent was in court when notice of the September 29, 2011, hearing was provided to him in person (IJ at 4). As such, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent was provided proper notice in accordance with section 239(a)(2) of the Act, and that any failure of counsel to remind him of the scheduled hearing does not rise to the level of ineffective assistance (IJ at 4). Therefore, even assuming that the respondent has demonstrated due diligence, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not meet his burden to establish exceptional circumstances that justify his failure to appear.
 
*4 On appeal, the respondent further argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that the respondent has not demonstrated he was prejudiced by prior counsel’s actions (IJ at 5; Respondent’s Br. at 14-16, December 29, 2017; Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider at 10-12, 16-18). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not shown that his prior counsel’s allegedly deficient performance caused him prejudice, as the record does not demonstrate that prior counsel failed to file an application for relief on the respondent’s behalf at the time of the respondent’s removal hearing. See Ochieng v. Mukasey, 520 F.3d 1110, 1115 (10th Cir. 2008) (alien must show that counsel’s ineffective assistance prejudiced him); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003) (“an alien alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must also show that he or she was prejudiced by the actions or inactions of counsel”). Although the respondent argues that his former attorney failed to file an asylum application on his behalf, as noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent does not describe in his affidavit that he had any conversations with counsel regarding the filing of an asylum application, nor has he provided any evidence to establish his eligibility for asylum and related relief (IJ at 5; Respondent’s Br. at 15). In fact, when the Immigration Judge asked if the respondent would be filing an asylum application, counsel stated that he had filed an I-360 and I-485 for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”), as he believed this to be a better avenue for relief (IJ at 5).
 
In addition, the respondent argues that former counsel failed to respond to a Request for Evidence (“RFE”) from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), which resulted in the denial of his I-360 (IJ at 5; Respondent’s Br. at 14-15; Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider at 12). As noted by the Immigration Judge, the record indicates that while his first I-360 was denied for failure to respond to an RFE, USCIS later reopened the application and allowed the respondent another opportunity to reply to the RFE (IJ at 5). Although the respondent claims that his attorney never responded to the second RFE and that the application was therefore denied, the respondent did not address this in his affidavit and did not submit evidence to corroborate this claim (IJ at 5; Respondent’s Br. at 15). In fact, the evidence submitted by the respondent for the first time on appeal pertaining to this claim demonstrates that the I-360 had been pending since it was reopened in April 2011 and was recently denied by USCIS on August 24, 2017, as the respondent is now over 21 years old and married and therefore ineligible under section 101(a)(27)(J) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J) (Respondent’s Br., tab E at 39). Thus, for the foregoing reasons, the respondent has not demonstrated the requisite prejudice to support his claim, as he has not demonstrated that any alleged deficiencies of his former counsel affected the outcome of proceedings (IJ at 5). See Ochieng v. Mukasey, 520 F.3d at 1115.
 
*5 The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances sufficient to justify exercising his discretionary authority to reopen the respondent’s removal proceedings sua sponte, and we decline to disturb his determination (IJ at 6; Respondent’s Br. at 8-11, February 9, 2018; Respondent’s Br. at 23-25, December 29, 2017; Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider at 18-21). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”).
 
To the extent that the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge did not consider the entire record in rendering his decision, we observe that an Immigration Judge is not required to discuss every piece of evidence of record in a decision (Respondent’s Br. at 21-22, December 29, 2017). Moreover, we have held that an Immigration Judge may make reasonable inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence in the record and is not required to interpret the evidence in the manner advocated by the respondent. See Matter of D-R-, 25 I&N Dec. 445, 454-55 (BIA 2011), clarified on other grounds by Matter of D-R-, 27 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 2017).
 
In his brief, the respondent has requested that we reissue the Immigration Judge’s September 29, 2011, decision in the interests of justice and to cure the errors made by prior counsel (Respondent’s Br. at 23, December 29, 2017). To the extent that the respondent’s request constitutes a request to reopen his removal proceedings and rescind his in absentia order, the request will be denied for the reasons discussed above.
 
The respondent submitted additional documents with his appellate brief and in a supplemental motion (Respondent’s Br., tabs A-H, February 9, 2018; Respondent’s Br., tabs A-U, December 29, 2017; Supplement in Support of Motion to Reopen, April 27, 2018). The Board does not consider new evidence presented for the first time on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (limiting the Board’s fact finding authority); see also Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 73-74 and n.10 (BIA 1984). Furthermore, even assuming the evidence was new and previously unavailable, to the extent that the request to consider these documents constitutes a motion to remand, the evidence submitted does not warrant a remand for further proceedings because it would not alter the outcome of this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
*6 Finally, we note that the respondent requested reopening to pursue adjustment of status in conjunction with an I-601A provisional unlawful presence waiver (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2). Effective August 29, 2016, there are new rules regarding provisional unlawful presence waivers. See Expansion of Provisional Unlawful Presence Waivers of Inadmissibility, 81 Fed. Reg. 50,244, 50,255-56, 50, 262 (July 29, 2016). The DHS has amended the rule to allow individuals with final removal orders to apply for provisional unlawful presence waivers if they have filed an application seeking consent to reapply for admission and such an application has been conditionally approved by the USCIS. See 81 Fed. Reg. 50,244, 50,275-76 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(iv)). Thus, the respondent does not need to have his removal proceedings reopened to be able to apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver with the USCIS. The respondent may request an administrative stay of removal from the DHS while any waiver or provisional waiver applications are pending before the USCIS. 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

The respondent filed a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Court on August 10, 2017 (Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider). However, the respondent perfected a timely appeal by filing a Notice of Appeal with this Board on August 10, 2017, prior to the Immigration Judge issuing a decision on the pending motion (Respondent’s Notice of Appeal). Accordingly, jurisdiction vested with the Board and the Immigration Judge was divested of jurisdiction over the motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of H-, 20 I&N Dec. 611, 612 n.1 (BIA 1992). That motion is now before us as a motion to remand, and the arguments therein are incorporated into the appeal and addressed in this decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4); BIA Practice Manual Rule 4.2(a)(ii).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Adam L. Crayk, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening; stay of removal
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on November 30, 2017, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s April 14, 2017,1 decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed from the United States in absentia. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider and reopen based on the ineffective assistance of his former counsel, and a request for a stay of removal. Essentially, the respondent alleges that he was never notified of the hearing date because his former counsel’s office erroneously sent an electronic copy of the notice to an incorrect e-mail address (Motion to Reconsider and Remand at 1, 4-5, Exh. 1). The record before us does not contain a brief from the Department of Homeland Security opposing the instant motion.2 The motion will be granted and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The respondent’s motion and supporting evidence convince us that reconsideration and reopening are warranted in this case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a)-(b)(1), (c)(1). In our prior decision, we concluded that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen because he had not filed a bar complaint against his former counsel pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988);3 and declined to consider evidence submitted on appeal. Given the circumstances and evidence presented in this case, including more recent evidence that the Utah State Bar has received and is investigating the respondent’s bar complaint against his former counsel (Motion to Reconsider and Remand, Exhs. 1-2), we will grant the motion, vacate our prior decision, and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision. On remand, the parties may submit additional arguments and evidence pertinent to this case. We express no opinion on the outcome of this case. Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider and reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s November 30, 2017, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s April 14, 2017, and March 23, 2017, decisions are vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDEER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision, and for the issuance of a new decision.
 
*2 FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vina Maria Fleisig, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on February 21, 2018, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s September 7, 2017, decision to deny his motion to reopen an order of removal entered in absentia. The respondent has now submitted an untimely motion to reopen proceedings on March 23, 2018. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion, which will be granted.
 
With his motion to reopen, the respondent alleges that his former attorney’s law firm, whom he hired in 2005 and who represented him during the time his 2009 Notice to Appear and subsequent in absentia removal order were issued, failed to inform him that they had not filed his Form I-751 in a timely fashion in 2008.1 In prior pleadings before the Immigration Judge and the Board, the respondent was represented by this prior law firm, and his requests for reopening were based on, inter alia, the failure to identify the name of the attorney who was supposed to file the Form I-751 (August 24, 2017 IJ at 1; September 7, 2017 IJ at 1), and the failure to file a proper claim pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).2
 
The respondent, with the assistance of current counsel, has now filed an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his prior law firm, and has included, inter alia, an affidavit and a copy of a complaint filed with the First Judicial Department, Attorney Grievance Committee, New York, New York, which outlines the respondent’s complaints. Given the evidence of record, the respondent’s proffered motion evidence, the arguments set forth in his current and prior motions, and the lack of DHS opposition, we will reopen the proceedings sua sponte to allow the respondent to present his arguments and evidence regarding his removability and, if necessary, his applications for relief from removal. The following order will, thus, be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

The respondent does not allege that his prior law firm represented him in removal proceedings, because he has alleged, consistently, that he never received his Notice to Appear. The DHS charged him with removability under section 237(a)(2)(D)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(D)(i), for failing to remove the conditions on his permanent residence pursuant to a Form I-751.

The respondent’s prior attorney argued that the respondent warranted a reopening of his proceedings based on “extraordinary circumstances.”

File: AXXX XX4 237 - Newark, NJ
May 8, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sumaira Khan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia, has appealed the September 15, 2017, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia for her failure to appear for the hearing on April 21, 2003. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that she did not receive actual notice of the hearing. She claims that the notice of hearing was improperly sent to her friend, Mr. Hoyos, who paid the respondent’s bond. The respondent states that she is now eligible for apply for adjustment of status.
 
An alien may not be entitled to receive notice of his hearing if he does not provide an address at which he may be contacted during proceedings. See section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(B) (eliminating the notice requirement where the alien fails to provide the required contact information); see also Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674-75 (BIA 2008) (stating that an alien must comply with the statutory responsibility to provide current address information).
 
Upon de novo review, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the motion to reopen. The record reflects that the Notice to Appear (NTA) was served personally on the respondent on July 6, 2001, and it contains the respondent’s signature (Exh. 1). The NTA advised the respondent of her obligation to maintain a current mailing address with the Immigration Court and of the consequences of failing to appear for any scheduled hearings. The NTA reflects that the respondent received oral notice in the Spanish language of the consequences of failing to appear for a hearing. The NTA informed the respondent that she had been placed in removal proceedings, and it provided information regarding the nature of the proceedings, including the opportunity to seek representation, and the conduct of the hearing. Current law does not require that the NTA be in any language other than English. See section 239 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229.
 
We note that on September 28, 2001, the respondent’s former attorney, Gino M. Mesa, filed a Form G-28 and a motion to change venue with the Houston Immigration Court, both of which set forth the respondent’s address on Cook Avenue, in Madison, New Jersey. On October 10, 2001, the change of venue to the Newark Immigration Court was granted. Mr. Mesa filed a motion to withdraw as attorney of record with the Newark Immigration Court on November 20, 2001, and again listed the respondent’s address on Cook Avenue, in Madison, New Jersey. The Newark Immigration Court initially sent notices of hearing to Mr. Mesa. However, on September 23, 2002, December 24, 2002, December 31, 2002, and February 4, 2003, the Newark Immigration Court sent notices of hearing to the respondent at the Cook Avenue address in Madison, New Jersey. The envelope containing the February 4, 2003, hearing notice was returned to the Immigration Court as “not deliverable as addressed - unable to forward,” and is in the record of proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on April 21, 2003, due to her failure to appear for the hearing.
 
*2 The respondent contends that the notice of hearing should have been sent to her at the address that appears on the Form I-213, dated June 29, 2001. However, the notice of hearing was sent to the respondent at the most recent address provided by the respondent’s former attorney. The respondent has not provided any evidence about where she actually lived, and she never provided a change of address to the Immigration Court in the 16 years since she was served with the NTA, as she was instructed to do. While the respondent contends that the Cook Avenue address belonged to a friend who posted bond, the respondent did not update her address with the Immigration Court, nor has she alleged ineffective assistance of counsel for her failure to appear. See Ramos-Olivieri v. Att’y Gen., 624 F.3d 622 (3d Cir. 2010) (court held that Board acted within its discretion denying motion to reopen since an evidentiary hearing on receipt of notice not warranted when alien both fails to arrange for a responsible person who still resides at the alien’s former address to forward all mail he receives and the alien fails to notify immigration authorities of a change in address); see also Santana Gonzalez v. Att’y Gen., 506 F.3d 274 (3d Cir. 2007); (holding that a weaker presumption of receipt applies when a notice of hearing is sent by regular mail); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Consequently, the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX5 507 - Napanoch, NJ
April 26, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Disha Chandiramani, Esquire
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 18, 2017, finding him ineligible from relief from removal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent was charged with being subject to removal under sections 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), (A)(iii), and (B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), A(iii), and (B)(i), as an alien who was convicted of a violation of a crime involving moral turpitude, a violation controlled substance and an aggravated felony, respectively. The Immigration Judge sustained the charge of removability and found the respondent ineligible for any relief from removal (IJ at 2). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision which has not been meaningfully challenged on appeal. The respondent is barred from cancellation of removal, as this form of relief is not available to lawful permanent resident aliens who, like the respondent, have been convicted of aggravated felonies. See section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229b(a)(3). The respondent to be statutorily ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal due to his aggravated felony conviction for a particularly serious crime for which he received a sentence of at least 5 years (IJ at 2). See sections 208(b)(2)(B)(i), 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.13(c), 1208.16(d)(2). The respondent did not apply for deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 2; Tr. at 13). With regard to the relief of adjustment of status, under section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255, the respondent has not shown that he is currently eligible for adjustment of status. There is no evidence that the respondent has an approved visa petition, or that a visa petition has ever been filed on his behalf.
 
The respondent claims on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying him a continuance to collaterally attack his conviction pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010) (Tr. at 6-7, 13-16).1 Though the respondent has filed a post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction, it does not render the conviction non-final. We note that the respondent’s conviction became final for immigration purposes when the respondent failed to appeal his conviction, allowed the appeal period to lapse, waived his right to a direct appeal, or exhausted the direct appeal of his conviction. See section 101(a)(48)(A) of Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A); Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009). We point out that this Board and the federal courts have consistently held that an alien may not collaterally attack the legitimacy of an otherwise valid state or federal criminal conviction in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Ponce De Leon Ruiz, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (BIA 1996, 1997; A.G. 1997); Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750 (BIA 1993); Matter of Fortis, 14 I&N Dec. 576, 577 (BIA 1974).2
 
*2 The respondent also asserts ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal. We find that respondent did not meet the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The instant claim of ineffective assistance does not comply with Lozada’s requirement that the claim be supported by an affidavit by the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement between himself and his legal representative and what actions were to be taken on his behalf. Furthermore, the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. at 561-62. This means that it is likely that the respondent would have prevailed at the hearing had the negligent representation not occurred. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: MOHAMMAD ASSIF ASSEFI A.K.A. MOHAMMED ASSIF ASSEFI
File: AXXX XX3 779 - Los Angeles, CA
April 25, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ayda Rashidian, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent timely appeals from the Immigration Judge’s November 11, 2017, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings based upon ineffective assistance of counsel he received during his hearing on June 26, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a brief on appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On June 26, 2012, the respondent’s counsel withdrew the respondent’s application for adjustment of status and declined to apply for any other forms of relief. The respondent was then ordered removed. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on October 20, 2017. In that motion, the respondent sought reopening based upon his prior counsel’s ineffective assistance. The respondent sought equitable tolling of the time and numerical limitations for motions to reopen. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent substantially complied with the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), but that reopening was not warranted because the respondent did not exercise due diligence in filing his motion to reopen and did not establish prima facie eligibility for relief, i.e., withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 3).
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the credibility determination, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent has not established that his former counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence and that he was prejudiced by her performance. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent argues that he was prejudiced by his former attorney’s performance because she did not explain to him that asylum (or asylum related relief) was a viable option and that his attorney should have known that he was ineligible for adjustment of status and advised him to pursue withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture instead.
 
The record does not support the respondent’s argument. As highlighted by the respondent on appeal and noted by the Immigration Judge below, the option of asylum (or asylum related relief such as withholding of removal) was discussed during the initial hearing and the respondent’s attorney expressed that although the respondent was generally afraid of returning to Afghanistan and his attorney suggested applying for asylum, the respondent was reluctant to apply (IJ at 3; Respondent’s Brief at 14). Additionally, the letter from the respondent’s former attorney states that she was paid to represent him in an “““adjustment of status case and/or asylum case,” the respondent was informed that he could apply for asylum, and that the option of asylum was discussed. Thus, the evidence of record indicates that the respondent chose not to pursue asylum related relief.
 
*2 The respondent asserts on appeal that he chose to pursue adjustment of status in lieu of asylum related relief because his former attorney advised him that an adjustment of status application would likely be successful. Though pursuing adjustment of status was an unsuccessful tactical decision due to the respondent’s criminal record, the respondent’s eligibility for adjustment of status is not at issue at this time. Rather, the issue is whether the respondent was advised that asylum related relief was an option and if he was given the opportunity to apply for such relief. It appears from the record before us that the respondent was both advised of the option of asylum related relief and that he was given the opportunity to apply for such relief. Indeed, the respondent and the Immigration Judge note that asylum related relief was “““suggested” by the respondent’s former counsel, but that the respondent declined to apply (IJ at 3; Respondent’s Brief at 14). Consequently, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent did not establish that his prior counsel’s performance was prejudicial.
 
Finally, although not explicitly requested, the respondent has not shown that an “exceptional situation” exists that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Lorely R. Fernandez
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from a July 7, 2017, Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings.1 We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, under the “““clearly erroneous” standard and we review all other issues de novo, including questions of law, discretion, and judgment. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii); Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002).
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was ordered removed on January 29, 1999, departed the United States, and reentered the country in 2000. In May 2017, the respondent moved to reopen his proceedings, more than 18 years after he was ordered removed. The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent’s motion was untimely and that he did not meet the requirements for equitable tolling of the 90-day filing deadline. Given these determinations, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent is precluded from relief due to a “departure bar.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (2017); Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir 2016); (July 7, 2017 IJ Dec. at 1-4).
 
A respondent may file one motion to reopen proceedings within 90 days of a final order. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Here, the respondent did not file an appeal and the Immigration Judge’s January 29, 1999, order became the final decision on the matter. Given that date, the respondent had until approximately April 29, 1999, to file a timely motion to reopen, but he did not file it until May 2017, more than 18 years after the filing deadline. Id. An alien has a statutory right to file a motion to reopen, regardless of whether he has left the United States, provided that the motion meets the time and numerical limitations specified by the Act. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act; Garcia-Carias v. Holder, 697 F.3d 257, 263-64 (5th Cir. 2012).
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that his proceedings should be reopened because his 1998 conviction is no longer considered an aggravated felony and he is not removable as charged. The respondent notes that he was placed in removal proceedings, ordered removed in January 1999, and left the country. However, the respondent stresses that a lawful permanent resident card was issued to him (errantly) in March 1999, after he was ordered removed and departed the country. He was admitted to the United States in 2000 using that mistakenly-issued card, and believed that he was lawfully present in the country. He attempted to renew that lawful permanent resident card in 2008, learned that it had been issued in error, and ultimately was placed into proceedings in the Phoenix Immigration Court in 2010. Those proceedings are still open. The respondent moved the El Paso, Texas, Immigration Court to reopen his original removal proceedings in May 2017.2
 
*2 It is undisputed that the respondent’s motion was not timely filed; the respondent did not move to reopen proceedings until more than 18 years after he was ordered removed. However, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case rests, the 90-day filing deadline may be equitably tolled where a respondent demonstrates that 1) “he has pursued his rights diligently,” and 2) “some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.” Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016) (internal citation omitted). The legal authority the respondent relies upon to assert that his conviction no longer rendered him removable was issued in 2001, but the respondent did not move to reopen proceedings on this basis for another 16 years. That is not due diligence.
 
Even presuming, without deciding that the errant March 1999 issuance of a lawful permanent resident card constituted an exceptional circumstance, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not pursue his rights with reasonable diligence after learning in 2010 (at the latest) when he was placed back into proceedings that he was not lawfully present in the United States. The respondent offers no explanation for the 7-year delay in filing the motion to reopen after learning that his lawful permanent resident card was not properly issued. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated that he warrants an equitable tolling of the 90-day filing deadline. Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d at 344.
 
Because the respondent did not file within the time limit or meet the requirements for equitable tolling, his motion does not comply with the requirements for a statutory motion to reopen. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act;; Garcia-Carias v. Holder, 697 F.3d at 263-64. If a respondent does not meet the statutory limitations, an Immigration Judge may exercise its regulatory sua sponte authority to reopen a case. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). However, unlike a statutory motion, a regulatory motion is subject to the “departure bar,” which prohibits motions to reopen “by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b); Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, 330 F.3d 672, 675-76 (5th Cir. 2003). Here, the Immigration Judge could not exercise sua sponte authority because the respondent left the United States in January 1999 after a final order of removal, and thus the regulatory “““departure bar” applies. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); see also Ovalles v. Holder, 577 F.3d 288, 296-97 (5th Cir. 2009) (upholding Board’s determination that it lacked sua sponte authority to reopen case due to regulatory departure bar, where alien’s motion was untimely and he thus had no statutory right to have his motion heard). For these reasons, we will affirm the denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
*3 Finally, the respondent mentions in passing that, if the Board concludes that counsel may have been ineffective by not moving to reopen sooner, we should remand the record to the Immigration Judge to allow counsel to withdraw so that the respondent can retain “new counsel and file a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel” (Respondent’s Br. at 9). We do not sua sponte review the record for ineffective assistance of counsel. Instead, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be supported by (1) an affidavit from the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel regarding the matters the attorney was retained to address, (2) documentary evidence that the counsel in question was informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond, and (3) proof that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to the alleged ineffective assistance (and if this is not filed, why it was not). Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).
 
Here, the respondent did not comply with any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639. Indeed, counsel did not expressly assert that he was ineffective or provide any other relevant information regarding the filing of the motion to reopen. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit requires strict compliance with Lozada in order to put forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 2014). Thus, we will not address this issue further.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be issued.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent came to the United States on or about September 09, 1982, as a lawful permanent resident. On December 7, 1998, the respondent was convicted in the 70th Judicial District Court, Ector County, Texas, for the offense of driving while intoxicated, third offense, in violation of TEX. PENAL CODE § 49.09, for which he received a sentence of 5 years. On January 29, 1999, the respondent was ordered removed to Mexico during an in-person hearing, after being found removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), for having committed an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43). The respondent did not apply for relief and waived appeal (Exhs. 1, 1A, 2; January 29, 1999 IJ Dec. at 1).

File: AXXX XX7 866 - Los Angeles, CA
April 23, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lisa Pickering, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jordan, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on December 4, 2012, after not appearing at her hearing. She filed a motion to reopen on February 20, 2013, alleging insufficient notice, which the Immigration Judge denied on June 5, 2013.1 On October 17, 2017, the respondent submitted a second motion to reopen, and appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 26, 2017, denying the motion.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that “exceptional circumstances,” to wit, ineffective assistance of counsel, prevented her appearance at the hearing, inasmuch as her former attorney did not notify her of the court date (Respondent’s Br. at 8-12). See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C) (providing that a motion to reopen based on “exceptional circumstances,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1), must be filed within 180 days of the removal order). The respondent filed her October 17, 2017, motion more than 180 days after the hearing. It is therefore untimely. Moreover, the motion is number-barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
In addition, we decline to equitably toll the time and number requirements. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 677 (9th Cir. 2011) (requiring for equitable tolling that an alien acted with “due” or “reasonable” diligence in discovering any “deception, fraud, or error” that prevented an alien from timely filing a motion). Initially, the respondent has not satisfied the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598 (9th Cir. 2004) (stating that an alien’s letter of complaint to a bar association about a former attorney did not substantially comply with the Lozada requirement that an alien notify former attorney of an ineffective assistance allegation and give the attorney an adequate opportunity to respond). The respondent has submitted evidence that she has filed a complaint against former counsel with a state bar association. However, she has not established that she notified former counsel that she had accused him of ineffective assistance of counsel in proceedings before the Immigration Court.
 
*2 Furthermore, the respondent states in her bar complaint that she obtained a copy of her file from former counsel in May 2016. Presumably, the respondent was then aware that the Immigration Judge had denied her first motion to reopen and no appeal was filed from that decision. However, the respondent waited until October 17, 2017, to file her second motion to reopen. Hence, the respondent did not act with due diligence. In light of the foregoing, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s October 17, 2017, motion to reopen based on untimeliness.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Peter E. Torres, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent moves the Board to reconsider our October 25, 2017, decision dismissing her appeal from the Immigration Judge’s June 20, 2017, decision denying her untimely, number-barred motion to reopen.1 See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The motion will be denied.
 
In her prior motion to reopen, filed before the Immigration Judge on June 2, 2017, the respondent alleged ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of an attorney who filed an application for prosecutorial discretion on her behalf in 2014, asserting that the attorney failed to submit an application for asylum and withholding of removal (Form I-589) to the Immigration Judge. In his decision, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had previously filed a motion to reopen that was denied on May 9, 2014, and that the respondent waited 3 years thereafter to file her second motion to reopen. In our prior order, we found that the respondent did not establish that she suffered prejudice as the result of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
In the instant motion, the respondent asserts that she substantially complied with the requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). However, although the respondent may have offered a statement in support of the motion, the statement did not set forth the terms of the attorney’s representation. Thus, the respondent not only failed to comply with the Lozada requirements, she has not shown that that the failure to submit a Form I-589 was the result of any error on the part of counsel. Id. The respondent, therefore, failed to show that her former attorney’s handling of her case resulted in prejudice. Further, the respondent, who was represented by a third attorney upon the filing of her first motion to reopen in 2014, did not show that she exercised due diligence in discovering the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Indeed, she has not explained the delay in bringing the matter before the Immigration Judge 3 years after the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel occurred. Under the circumstances, neither equitable tolling of the filing deadline nor reopening sua sponte was warranted. See Akwada v. Ashcroft, 113 F. App’x 532, 538-39 (4th Cir. 2004). See also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
*2 In sum, we find no error of fact or law in our prior order to warrant reconsideration. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). Accordingly, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

IN RE: SILVIA ELIZABETH AREVALO-CASTILLO
File: AXXX XX1 124 - Memphis, TN
April 19, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marisa-Andrea L. Moore, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated August 17, 2017, denying her motion to reopen the proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against her on July 10, 2013. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The respondent received proper notice of her removal hearing. On April 8, 2012, the respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear (“NTA”) and, thus, was aware she had been placed in removal proceedings (IJ at 1, 3; Exh. 1). See Matter of Cubor-Cruz, 25 I&N Dec. 470 (BIA 2011) (personal service of an NTA on a minor who is 14 years of age or older at the time of service is effective). The NTA informed the respondent of her obligation to keep her address updated with the court as well as the consequences of failing to appear at a hearing (IJ at 3-4; Exh. 1). Section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(B); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.15(b)(7), 1003.15(d).
 
On January 11, 2013, the notice of hearing was properly mailed to the respondent’s last known address, which was that of her father (Exh. 3). Sections 239(a)(1)(F), 239(c), and 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229(a)(1)(F), 1229(c), and 1229a(b)(5)(A); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.13, 1003.26(d). The respondent had moved from that address in May 2012 and did not comply with the statutory address obligations by providing a current address pursuant to section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act (IJ at 3-4; Exh. 4; Motion at Tab A, no. 13). For aliens not in detention, written notices of hearing are not required if the alien has failed to provide the address required under section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act. Sections 239(a)(2)(B) and 240(b)(5)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(d). Because the notice of hearing was mailed to the respondent’s last known address and she failed to provide the court with her current address, she received proper notice of her hearing.
 
*2 With respect to the respondent’s claim of exceptional circumstances, her motion is untimely because she did not file her motion within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s decision.1 Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The Immigration Judge properly declined to equitably toll the applicable filing requirements. The doctrine of equitable tolling excuses an alien’s untimely motion if she can show that “despite diligent efforts, she did not discover the injury until after the limitations period had expired.” Barry v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 721, 724 (6th Cir 2008) (quotation omitted). “Equitable tolling may apply when a petitioner has received ineffective assistance of counsel.” Mezo v Holder, 615 F.3d 616, 620 (6th Cir. 2010). The respondent must show that she diligently pursued her rights and was prejudiced by counsel’s ineffective assistance. Mezo v Holder, 615 F.3d at 620. Prejudice means that “but for counsel’s error, [the respondent] would have been entitled to continue residing in the United States.” Hulcochea-Gomez v INS, 237 F.3d 696, 699-700 (6th Cir. 2001).
 
Here, equitable tolling is not warranted. The respondent’s vague statements about consulting with an unnamed attorney to get her immigration paperwork are insufficient to establish a claim to ineffective assistance of counsel (IJ at 5; Motion at Tab A, nos. 19, 20). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.3d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The Immigration Judge properly rejected the respondent’s claim that her minority and the irresponsibility of her guardian (her father) constitute an exceptional circumstance (IJ at 5). The respondent was an adult at the time of the Immigration Judge’s July 10, 2013, decision, and her father’s filing of a Missing Juvenile Report with the police and hiring of an attorney to file a Form EOIR-33 indicating the respondent’s address was “unknown” after she ran away, do not support her claim (IJ at 5; Exh. 4). Moreover, even if the respondent tried unsuccessfully to get her immigration paperwork from her father, she does not claim to have contacted the Immigration Court to ask about the status of her case or any scheduled hearings or to provide her new address (Motion at Tab A, nos. 16-18, Tab B at nos. 8-9, Tab C at no. 10, Tab J, Tab L at 8-12). The respondent has not shown that she diligently pursued her rights.
 
Nor has the respondent shown that the application of the extraordinary remedy of sua sponte reopening is warranted. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). A removal hearing is reopened sua sponte only in “exceptional circumstances” and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. at 984. The respondent has not presented exceptional circumstances which would merit sua sponte reopening of the proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.2
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent submitted a Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal with her motion (Motion at Tab O). A motion to reopen may be filed at any time if the alien is seeking asylum or withholding of removal based on changed country conditions arising in the country of the alien’s nationality or the country to which the alien is to be removed. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013). The respondent did not claim changed country conditions in her motion or on appeal. Therefore, we will not further address this issue.

IN RE: FELIPE LOPEZ-CAMARILLO
File: AXXX XX7 718 - San Diego, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Murray D. Hilts, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael K. Adams
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Termination
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s June 7, 2017, decision denying his motion to suppress evidence and to terminate proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s factual determinations, including credibility determinations, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board uses a de novo standard of review for questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge made the following findings of fact without clear error. The respondent first appeared at a May 2015 master calendar hearing and stated that Spanish was his best language (IJ at 2). Thereafter, he appeared with counsel on June 22, 2016, admitted all factual allegations, conceded the charge of removal arising under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and was granted until February 2017 to seek prosecutorial discretion or apply for relief (IJ at 2). At the next hearing, the respondent appeared with two attorneys, sought to substitute counsel, and stated that he only spoke a little Spanish, and that the language he spoke and understood best was Mixteco (IJ at 2-3). At the next master calendar hearing on March 10, 2017, the respondent appeared with new counsel and filed a motion to withdraw his plea, to suppress evidence, and to terminate proceedings (IJ at 3). In support of that motion, the respondent submitted a declaration made under penalty of perjury wherein he states that he ditcated the declaration in Spanish, his native language, that he was pulled over by immigration officers in February 2015 while driving lawfully, that he did not feel free to leave once pulled over, and that he was not provided with evidence against him or told how to “““fight his case” when he first appeared before the Immigration Judge (IJ at 3, Exh. 7B).
 
The Notice to Appear was personally served on the respondent on February 19, 2015, upon his arrest after a traffic stop (Exhs. 1, 7A). The respondent’s motion to terminate is based on his argument that evidence of his alienage, as set forth in, inter alia, the Form I-213, Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien (Exh. 7A), was obtained by the Department of Homeland Security (“the DHS”) via an egregious violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. In his declaration in support of his motion, the respondent stated that he was “not breaking any laws or causing any disturbances” when he was stopped by the officers (Exh. 7B). The I-213 indicated that the respondent was driving a “““target vehicle” identified by make, model, color, and license plate (Exh. 7B). The vehicle was stopped, the respondent was identified by a Mexican identification card, and he admitted his Mexican nationality (Id).
 
*2 In removal proceedings, an alien seeking the exclusion of evidence based on the Fourth Amendment bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case that evidence should be suppressed. Matter of Tang, 13 I&N Dec. 691 (BIA 1971). While the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is generally inapplicable to deportation proceedings, this rule may be applied if there are egregious Fourth Amendment violations that transgress Fifth Amendment notions of fundamental fairness, undermining the probative value of the evidence. See also Matter of Sandoval, 17 I&N Dec. 70 (BIA 1979); Matter of Garcia, 17 I&N Dec. 319, 321 (BIA 1980) (respondent made prima facie showing that admissions were given involuntarily and the government presented no contrary evidence; proceedings terminated); Matter of Tow, 17 I&N Dec. 340, 343 (BIA 1980). The request to exclude evidence should be made via a motion to suppress that is supported by an affidavit or other objective evidence that explains why suppression is appropriate. Matter of Barcenas, 19 I&N Dec. 609 (BIA 1988); Matter of Wong, 13 I&N Dec. 820, 822 (BIA 1971). When an alien has come forward with adequate evidence in support of suppression, the burden shifts to the DHS to justify the manner in which it obtained the evidence. Matter of Barcenas, 19 I&N Dec. at 611. However, the identity of an alien (as distinguished from alienage) is not suppressible, even if it is conceded that an illegal arrest, search, or interrogation occurred. See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1051 (1984); Matter of Cervantes-Torres, 21 I&N Dec. 351, 353 (BIA 1996) (alien’s previously-submitted application for work authorization could be submitted as evidence of alienage even if egregious arrest occurred).
 
In this case, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s finding that the record does not contain evidence to support the respondent’s contention that the evidence of his alienage was obtained via an egregious violation of his Fourth Amendment rights (IJ at 5). The record lacks evidence that the respondent was targeted for an inappropriate reason such as race or that he did not voluntarily admit to his alienage (Id). Therefore, the burden did not shift to the DHS to justify the way that it obtained the evidence of the respondent’s alienage. Because no prima facie evidence of an egregious violation of the Fourth Amendment has been proffered, we reject the respondent’s contention that he should have been permitted to confront the author of the I-213 (Respondent’s Br. at 12)1
 
*3 To the extent that the respondent argues on appeal that his prior counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel and his plea should be withdrawn based on this, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that this allegation has not been supported by adequate evidence or by adherence to the procedural prerequisites to making such a claim (IJ at 4-5). See Respondent’s Br. at 5-6. As noted, the respondent’s claim not to have understood prior proceedings in which his alienage and removability were admitted is undermined by his preparation of an affidavit in the Spanish language (IJ at 5-6). Furthermore, although the respondent argues on appeal that he did not know of the evidence against him and would not have conceded the removal charge, he has not shown that his attorney’s decision to concede this charge was ineffective assistance, since there is no evidence in the record reflecting that he is not an alien or that he has any right to remain in the United States. Cf. Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931 (9th Cir. 1986) (finding that the decision to forego contesting deportability in favor of a generous grant of voluntary departure is a tactical choice). He also has not complied with the procedural steps-such as notifying former counsel or filing a claim with relevant bar authorities-which we have indicated are a prerequisite for making such a claim. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We therefore find no cause to disturb the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to terminate or to withdraw his concession of the charges based on due process violations stemming from ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Finally, for the reasons stated by the Immigration Judge, including but not limited to the fact that the respondent unlawfully re-entered the United States after his nine prior voluntary returns, we affirm the denial of the respondent’s application for voluntary departure.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the appeal will be dismissed on the entry of the following order.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Georges S. Zeidan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 19, 2017, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his application for adjustment of status. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider and request for a stay of removal with the Board. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The motion and stay will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider shall specify “errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of 0-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The respondent’s motion does not establish any error in our previous decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not testify and dismissing his appeal.
 
To the extent that the respondent is attempting to raise new arguments related to his application for adjustment status, these arguments are not properly raised for the first time in a motion to reconsider. See 0-S-G-, 20 I&N Dec. at 58 (stating that “[a] motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied” and “arguments for consideration on appeal should all be submitted at one time, rather than in piecemeal fashion.”) (citation omitted). A motion to reconsider is neither a vehicle for advancing supplemental legal arguments that could have been previously raised nor a mechanism for submitting a late-filed brief. Moreover, we are not persuaded that the respondent’s supplemental arguments regarding the nature of his marriage and his new allegation that his marriage has been over since 2012 establishes any error in the Board’s or Immigration Judge’s decision. Disagreement with the result is not sufficient. Therefore, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is more in the nature of a timely motion to reopen. Applicable regulations provide that a motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). A motion to reopen must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief “and all supporting documentation.” Id. In addition, where an alien seeks to apply for relief for which he or she has previously been provided an opportunity to apply at the former hearing, a showing of changed circumstances since the time of the hearing must be made. Id. Moreover, the movant must establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 319 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988).
 
*2 The respondent alleges for the first time that his marriage has been deteriorating since 2012 and attributes the adverse credibility finding to the state of his marriage (Motion at 4-5; Exh. A). He further argues that his counsel made a “good faith error” in not arguing that the marriage was bona fide at inception (Motion at 5).
 
To the extent the respondent is arguing that he is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not complied with any of the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).1 Regardless, the respondent has failed to explain why neither he nor his wife mentioned the deterioration of their marriage in their extensive testimony.
 
Finally, the evidence submitted along with the respondent’s motion, his own affidavit attesting to the deterioration of his marriage, is neither new nor previously unavailable and the respondent has not explained why he did not mention this at his hearing below. Thus, the respondent has not submitted persuasive new or previously unavailable evidence that is sufficient to meet his “heavy burden” of showing that it is likely that the result would change if the proceedings were reopened. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Therefore, we do not find that he has met his burden of showing that reopening of these proceedings is warranted.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

File: AXXX XX9 992 - Harlingen, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Harry Asatrian, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa Putnam
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 24, 2017, denying his motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal. The respondent was previously ordered removed in absentia for failure to appear for his removal hearing on April 19, 2006.1 See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). In his appeal, the respondent also requests that the proceedings be reopened and the case be remanded to the Immigration Court based on ineffective assistance by his prior attorney. We will construe the requests as a motion to remand. See Correa-Rivera v. Holder, 706 F.3d 1128, 1131 (9th Cir. 2013) (construing an appeal asserting an ineffective assistance claim as a motion to reopen); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4). The appeal will be dismissed and the motion to remand will be denied.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent claims ineffective assistance against an attorney who filed a motion to reopen on his behalf with the Immigration Court in Harlingen, Texas. Specifically, the respondent avers that the prior attorney performed ineffectively when he did not argue in the motion that the respondent’s failure to appear for his hearing was because he relied on erroneous advice from a notario (Respondent’s Br. at 7-9).2 The respondent further claims that he is prima facie eligible for asylum and that he would have pursued his asylum claim, but for his prior attorney’s failure to submit an application for asylum and withholding of removal, along with evidence of changed country conditions (Respondent’s Br. at 6, 15-16).
 
A motion to remand for the purpose of presenting additional evidence must conform to the same standards as a motion to reopen. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-72 (BIA 1992). The instant motion to remand is untimely, having been filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia on April 19, 2006. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). It is also numerically barred as the respondent has already filed one motion to reopen with the Harlingen Immigration Court. See section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (BIA 2000) (holding that because the Immigration Judge entered a final administrative decision, the respondent’s motion to remand must be subject to the time and numerical limits for motions to reopen).
 
*2 Assuming, arguendo, that the instant motion was not untimely or numerically barred, the respondent is not entitled to reopening based on ineffective assistance by the prior attorney because he has not demonstrated that the ineffective representation, if any, resulted in prejudice. See Miranda-Lores v. I.N.S., 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994) (requiring an alien to show “ineffective representation” and “substantial prejudice” as a result of the ineffective representation when raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 638 (requiring the respondent to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance when making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).3
 
The respondent asserts that his prior attorney rendered ineffective assistance when she did not argue that his failure to appear was due to misinformation from a notario (Respondent’s Br. at 7). See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and 240(e)(1) of the Act; see also Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 798, 802 (5th Cir. 2007) (determining that advice of an attorney not to appear at an immigration proceeding constitutes an exceptional circumstance beyond an alien’s control). In refuting this claim, the prior attorney states in her response to the respondent’s allegations that “My records show that [the respondent] advised me that he had consulted with an attorney and that attorney had asked him to come back to his office in three weeks if he did not get any court notice in the mail. The attorney told him that he could not represent him in court if there is no court date yet. I do not think there are genuine grounds for an ineffective assistance of counsel under these circumstances” (Respondent’s Br. at 13). As such, the respondent has not demonstrated that his prior attorney performed ineffectively.
 
There was also no substantial prejudice to the respondent as his motion was untimely and the filing deadline would not have been equitably tolled because the respondent did not demonstrate due diligence in pursuing his case. Even if the respondent’s prior attorney had successfully argued the exceptional circumstance of ineffective assistance, his motion to reopen was filed well beyond 180 days after the date of the order of removal on April 19, 2006. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i).
 
Moreover, the filing deadline would not have been equitably tolled because the respondent did not establish due diligence in pursuing his rights or any extraordinary circumstance that prevented him from timely filing. Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016); see Toora v. Holder, 603 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir. 2010) (finding that equitable tolling did not excuse the respondent’s late-filed motion because the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in seeking a rescission of his deportation order). The respondent filed his first motion to reopen 11 years after he was ordered removed in absentia on April 19, 2006. Furthermore, he sought legal assistance only after he was detained by the Department of Homeland Security pursuant to a traffic stop (Respondent’s Br. at 2). Under these circumstances, the prior attorney’s conduct did not prejudice the respondent as his motion to reopen was untimely.
 
*3 While the respondent’s prior attorney did not submit an asylum application or evidence of changed country conditions to the Immigration Judge with the motion to reopen, this error also did not prejudice the respondent. In this case, proving prejudice requires the respondent to make a prima facie showing that he may have been entitled to asylum or withholding of removal had the prior attorney performed effectively. See Miranda-Lores v. I.N.S., 17 F.3d at 85 (holding that the petitioner was not prejudiced by his counsel’s ineffective assistance where he did not merit the grant of relief). Yet, even taking the respondent’s representations as true for purposes of his motion, his fear of gang violence and extortion in El Salvador would not qualify him for relief. Castillo-Enriquez v. Holder, 690 F. 3d 667(5th Cir. 2012) (holding that fear of extortion based on perceived wealth is not a ground for asylum); Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 250 (observing that extortion and other violent gang behavior do not, by themselves, establish a basis for asylum). See also Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161, 169 (BIA 2013) (requiring an alien seeking reopening to establish a prima facie case for a grant asylum); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. at 472 (holding that the Board may deny a motion to reopen where a prima facie case for the relief sought has not been established).
 
Finally, the respondent argues in the alternative that we should exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen the case (Respondent’s Br. at 16-17). However, we conclude that there are no exceptional circumstances that would warrant reopening and remanding this matter pursuant to our sua sponte authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

The removal proceedings were conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), which applies to cases in which service of the hearing notice occurs after April 1, 1997.

In the motion to reopen, the prior attorney initially claimed that the respondent did not appear for his removal hearing because he did not receive notice of his hearing date (Respondent’s Mot. at 362). However, on appeal, the respondent conceded that he was properly served the Notice to Appear (NTA), which contained the hearing date and the consequences of failing to appear (Respondent’s Br. at 7). Therefore, the Immigration Judge did not err in finding that there was proper notice to the respondent (IJ at 1).

We will consider the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim against the prior attorney because the respondent meets the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998) (Respondent’s Mot. at 32-64). See Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 2014) (holding that an alien must strictly comply with the Lozada requirements); see also Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639 (setting forth the three requirements that a motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must meet).

File: AXXX XX4 510 - Chicago, IL
March 23, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Heather Hadi, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on December 13, 2017, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
In the motion, the respondent argues that his proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney Brian Bennet, who represented him at hearing and on appeal. Specifically, the respondent argues that the former counsel provided ineffective assistance because the former counsel: (1) sought a continuance of the respondent’s proceedings to pursue post-conviction relief of one of the respondent’s convictions, even though the respondent would still be ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), under the “stop time rule,” even if the post-conviction relief were granted; and (2) failed to advise the respondent to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The respondent’s motion states that he filed a bar complaint against the former counsel and notified the former counsel of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Motion;1 Motion Exhs. B-C).
 
As a threshold matter, despite the arguments that the respondent filed a bar complaint and notified the former counsel of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent has not shown that he has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The document submitted as proof of filing a bar complaint appears to be only part of the necessary complaint form (“Details of Complaint”) and the respondent did not submit evidence that the complaint was actually sent to the bar authority (Motion Exh. B). Furthermore, this complaint statement, which appears to be from the respondent’s mother, states that the former counsel “has not done anything for my son.” (id.). The brief email communication from current counsel to former counsel only addressed the respondent’s ineligibility for cancellation of removal, but did not address the alleged failure by the former counsel to advise the respondent to apply for asylum and related forms of relief (Motion Exh. C). Also significantly, the respondent has not submitted his own affidavit regarding the representation by the former counsel.2 Since the respondent did not substantially comply with Matter of Lozada, the motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel claim will be denied.
 
*2 In any event, the respondent has not shown prejudice from the ineffective assistance of counsel. While the respondent argues that the former counsel provided ineffective assistance for seeking continuance, he has not claimed or shown that the outcome of his proceedings was potentially affected because he sought a continuance. See El-Gazawy v. Holder, 690 F.3d 852, 860 (7th Cir. 2012); Rapheal v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 521, 533 (7th Cir. 2008) (prejudice means that the lack of a fair hearing actually had the potential for affecting the outcome of the proceedings); Hamid v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 642, 646-47 (7th Cir. 2005) (applicant’s failure to allege excluded testimony that would potentially affect outcome of hearing was fatal to due process claim).
 
As to the former counsel’s alleged failure to apply for asylum and related forms of relief, the respondent submitted letters from his mother and sister stating that they have received threats from people in Honduras who are now living on the land owned by the respondent and his sister, and that a cousin was killed in February 2017 while trying to protect land (Motion Exhs. D-E). However, the claim of threats shown in these documents is only general and vague, and the respondent’s motion offers no analysis on how he may have been granted asylum or related forms of relief based on the facts alleged.
 
Based on the above, the respondent’s motion will be denied. The motion for stay of removal is denied as moot.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jaime Jasso, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on November 20, 2017, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen so that he may present additional evidence relating to his allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion is also in the nature of a motion to reconsider. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The motion and request for a stay of removal will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent’s motion is in the nature of both a motion to reconsider and a motion to reopen. A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based upon the previous factual record, whereas a motion to reopen seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57-58 (BIA 2006). A party seeking reconsideration requests that the original decision be reexamined in light of alleged legal or factual errors, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. See O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. at 56; Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). Here, the respondent challenges the decision of the Immigration Judge and the Board and seeks to submit additional evidence in support of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
We first address that aspect of the motion requesting reconsideration. Any motion to reconsider a decision of the Board must be filed within 30 days after the date of that decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B). The record reflects that the Board did not receive the motion until February 8, 2018. The motion to reconsider was therefore filed untimely. Additionally, even if we reached the merits of the motion, it does not assert any error of fact or law in the Board’s decision, but essentially reiterates his arguments regarding his removability. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. at 56 (discussing regulatory requirement that a motion to reconsider specify “errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision”); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The Board considered these arguments and ultimately found them unpersuasive when we dismissed his appeal. Disagreement with the result, or raising arguments that could have been made previously, is not sufficient. Therefore, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
*2 We turn next to the timely motion to reopen. Applicable regulations provide that a motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, a movant must satisfy the “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must show that competent counsel would have acted otherwise and that the alien was prejudiced. See Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent still has not substantially complied with the Lozada procedural requirements.1 While the respondent has submitted a letter drafted to his former attorney, there is no objective evidence that this letter has actually been sent to or served on the respondent’s former attorney (Motion at page 10). More importantly, there is no evidence that a bar complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Regardless, the respondent still has not established prejudice. As mentioned earlier, none of the respondent’s arguments persuades us of any error in our prior determination that the respondent was properly placed in removal proceedings as an “arriving alien” and that he is removable as charged. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice from counsel’s actions or omissions such that he has established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. As such, the respondent’s motion is insufficient to meet his “heavy burden” of showing that it is likely that the result would change if the proceedings were reopened. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464. Therefore, we do not find that he has met his burden of showing that reopening of these proceedings is warranted.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Xiao Yan Huang
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on June 9, 2003, at which time the Board affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge of January 3, 2002. By a motion filed on October 20, 2017, the respondent seeks to have these proceedings reopened. The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
By the motion now before the Board, the respondent asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in order to seek the reopening of proceedings. The attorney who represented the respondent in those proceedings was disbarred in 2012.
 
The Board may in some cases grant a motion to reopen, including an untimely motion, in order to remedy an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See generally Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-640 (BIA 1988). However, it is incumbent upon the affected party to show that he or she exercised due diligence in pursuit of his or her claim and to comply generally with the requirements set forth in Lozada. See Ghahremani v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 993 (9th Cir. 2007) (equitable tolling recognized when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of error as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence); Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672 (9th Cir. 2011).
 
Given the passage of more than 14 years since our decision in this case, and the respondent’s failure to meaningfully show that she exercised due diligence in pursuing her ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we find no basis for tolling the time limits for motions in this case. Furthermore, the respondent has not shown that counsel’s representation was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Maravilla-Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004). Contrary to the arguments presented in the motion, the respondent was at least aware of the order of removal against her, and the reasons for the Immigration Judge’s denial of a further continuance (her own father’s failure to file an N-400 naturalization application or to even appear in court), as she was present with counsel and an interpreter at her January 2002 hearing. Furthermore, the respondent would not have been eligible for cancellation of removal at that time as she did not have 10 years of continuous physical presence. Absent such a showing, the respondent has failed to show the prejudice requisite to establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004) (to prevail on a due process claim founded on ineffective assistance of counsel, petitioner must demonstrate substantial prejudice resulting from the ineffectiveness).
 
*2 Finally, the respondent has not shown the existence of an exceptional situation warranting the grant of this untimely motion in the exercise of our sua sponte authority. While the respondent seeks to have the proceedings reopened in order to pursue adjustment of status based upon a petition filed on her behalf by her United States citizen son, untimely motions to reopen to pursue an application for adjustment of status do not fall within any of the statutory or regulatory exceptions to the time limits for motions to reopen before the Board and will generally be denied. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, we decline to reopen the proceedings in this matter and the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is, hereby, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Emmanuel West, Esquire
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Panama, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated October 10, 2017, ordering his removal from the United States. To resolve any issues regarding the effectiveness of the respondent’s waiver of his appeal rights, we will consider this matter on appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c). We will dismiss the appeal.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. At the removal hearing on October 10, 2017, the respondent, through counsel, conceded that he is subject to removal from the United States because, after his admission to this country as a nonimmigrant visitor in 2005, he did not timely depart (Tr. at 5; Exh. 1). Section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B). Through counsel, the respondent advised the Immigration Judge that “we have nothing to apply for that the court can grant” (Tr. at 4).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that, despite his prior counsel’s statements, he may qualify for cancellation of removal, asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. However, the respondent is bound by his prior counsel’s concessions and has not complied with the evidentiary requirements needed to properly present a claim to ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). Additionally, given that the respondent has not presented an application for relief on appeal, nor fully articulated his claims, he has not established that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s decision to not pursue relief from removal in these proceedings. Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005).
 
Finally, on appeal, the respondent raises arguments regarding mental competency. However, he has not articulated any particular reason to believe that he, himself, lacks mental competency. See Matter of J-S-S-, 26 I&N Dec. 679, 680 (BIA 2015) (discussing a case where an alien had a long history of mental illness); Matter of M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 474, 475 (BIA 2011). While, on appeal, the respondent argues that he did not understand what transpired in the courtroom, he does not argue that he was unable to meaningfully consult with his attorney. The mere fact that, due to a lack of fluency in the English language, the use of legal terms, or otherwise, an alien does not immediately understand the significance of an attorney’s decision to concede removability and decline to apply for relief does not, in itself, amount to an indicia of mental incompetency. Overall, the respondent has not raised sufficient claims on appeal which indicate that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense.
 
*2 For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to order the respondent’s removal from the United States to Panama. The following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: HERMINIA ROSADO
File: AXXX XX7 151 - Newark, NJ
March 5, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jerard A. Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order of removal in the respondent’s case on February 5, 2008, and on October 7, 2014, the Board denied the respondent’s second untimely motion to reopen for having been filed beyond the time and number limits imposed on motions to reopen. On August 8, 2017, the respondent filed the instant motion seeking reopening to enable her to apply for adjustment of status based on a visa petition, approved on August 25, 2011, classifying her as the parent of a United States citizen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not joined in or responded to this motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The motion is untimely and number barred, and the respondent has not shown that any exception to the filing deadline applies or should be applied in her case. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (2017); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), (3) (2017). The respondent specifically seeks the exercise of the Board’s discretion to reopen this case sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The respondent emphasizes her equities accrued in the United States, and asserts that her family will suffer hardship as a result of her removal.
 
While we recognize that the respondent’s removal will likely result in hardship, the motion does not demonstrate an exceptional situation to warrant the exercise of our limited sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “[t]he power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). In this regard, we note that becoming potentially eligible for relief after having been ordered removed from the United States is not an “exceptional situation”.
 
To the extent that the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to the filing of the prior motions, she has not complied with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and ineffective assistance of counsel is not apparent on the face of the record. See Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 133 (3d Cir. 2001). The respondent alleges that in filing the prior motions to reopen for adjustment of status on her behalf, former counsel failed to submit supporting documentation, and erred with regard to a specific date and the spelling of her son’s name. The prior motions, however, were not denied because of such errors. Instead, they were denied because they exceeded the statutory and regulatory limits imposed on motions to reopen. Moreover, the instant motion does not demonstrate that the respondent suffered prejudice as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel as she has not shown that she was prima facie eligibility for any form of relief during the period within which a timely motion to reopen could have been filed. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 640. See Fadiga v. Attorney General of the United States, 488 F.3d 142, 157 (3d Cir. 2007). Hence, equitable tolling of the filing restrictions imposed on the instant motion to reopen is not warranted in this case. See Alzaarir v. Attorney General of the United States, 639 F.3d 86 (3d Cir. 2011).
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, the respondent’s untimely, number-barred motion to reopen will be denied.1
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent, who is removable under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (alien present without being admitted or paroled), no longer needs to seek reopening of her removal proceedings to apply either to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for a provisional unlawful presence waiver or to the DHS for a stay of removal. Individuals with final orders of removal may apply for provisional waivers if they have first filed a Form I-212 application seeking consent to reapply for admission and such an application has been conditionally approved. 8 C.F.R. 212.7(e)(4)(iv). The USCIS has exclusive jurisdiction. 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(1). The respondent may request an administrative stay of removal from the DHS while any waiver or provisional waiver applications are pending before the USCIS. 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a).

IN RE: ELMER JOEL MONTOYA-SANDOVAL
File: AXXX XX6 075 - Dallas, TX
March 1, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
W. John Vandenberg, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 26, 2017, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for his hearing on May 21, 1998. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent contended that he did not receive the Notice to Appear (NTA) or the notice of hearing. See Respondent’s Motion at 1-2. Specifically, he admitted that shortly after entering the United States in 1998, he was placed into a “family detention center in Texas” and that after being transferred to another such facility, “he escaped.” See id. He therefore denied receipt of the NTA and hearing notices, and sought rescission of his removal order due to lack of notice.
 
On appeal, the respondent claims for the first time that he did not receive the notice of hearing because the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) “lost” him when he absconded from its custody shortly after being personally served with the NTA in April 1998. See Respondent’s Br. at 2-15. We also note that in his Notice of Appeal, the respondent claimed that the prior attorney who filed his motion to reopen provided ineffective assistance in failing to determine whether he had a fear of returning to Honduras, the country of his birth and to which he had been ordered removed.1 The respondent accordingly submits an application for asylum on appeal. See Respondent’s Br. at Exh. 6.
 
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii), an order of removal entered in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal, if based on exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). A motion to reopen based on a lack of notice under section 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act may be filed at any time. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Furthermore, the time and number limits for motions to reopen do not apply to a motion to reopen proceedings if the basis of the motion is to apply or reapply for asylum or withholding of removal based on changed country conditions or changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), 1003.23(b)(4)(i); see also Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013) (holding that proceedings conducted in absentia may be reopened where the alien seeks asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions).
 
*2 Inasmuch as the record reflects that the NTA was served personally on the respondent on April 20, 1998,2 the Immigration Judge properly found that the respondent had notice of the initiation of these proceedings, and also of the requirement that he provide the DHS with his current address. See IJ at 2-3. An alien may not be entitled to receive notice of his hearing if he does not provide an address at which he may be contacted during proceedings. See section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Act (eliminating the notice requirement where the alien fails to provide the required contact information); see also Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d at 359 (court found that alien did not receive notice of his hearing because he failed to comply with his obligation to provide the Immigration Court with current address information); Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674-75 (BIA 2008) (stating that an alien must comply with the statutory responsibility to provide current address information). The respondent appears to argue on appeal that he never was under an obligation to update his address with the Immigration Court because (1) he was a minor, and (2) the DHS “lost” him and, therefore, assumed the obligation to somehow provide his current address to the court. See generally, Respondent’s Br. at 8-15. The respondent’s argument in this regard ignores the Immigration Judge’s factual finding (which lacks clear error) that he “escaped” the detention center, and in fact, was not “lost” due to the actions of the DHS. Further, a notice of the obligation to provide a current address, and the consequences of any failure to do so, was expressly set forth in the NTA with which the respondent was personally served. See Matter of Cubor, 25 I&N Dec. 470 (BIA 2011) (personal service of NTA on minor who is 14 years of age or older is effective). As such, any argument premised on the DHS failing to provide the basic standard of care to juvenile aliens in its custody fails.
 
To the extent that the respondent seeks reopening to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture, we reiterate that the time and number limits for motions to reopen do not apply if the motion is based on previously unavailable evidence of changed country conditions or changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality.3 We observe, however, that the respondent has not presented any documentation with his motion to reopen showing the country conditions in Honduras at the time that his removal order was issued on May 21, 1998, and thus has not shown that a material change has occurred since that time. The record also contains no sworn written statement by the respondent detailing his fears of returning to Honduras. See Waggoner v. Gonzales, 488 F.3d 632, 639 (5th Cir. 2007) (a motion to reopen must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documents); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). We therefore find inadequate support for the motion to reopen to permit the respondent to pursue this application for relief.
 
*3 Furthermore, although the respondent stated in his Notice of Appeal that the attorney who represented him in the filing of his motion to reopen provided ineffective assistance, this claim is not supported by a written statement detailing this claim, or by evidence that the respondent reported the alleged ineffective assistance to relevant state bar agencies or that he informed his prior counsel of the allegations leveled against him or gave him an opportunity to respond. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).
 
Finally, as a matter of discretion, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the facts presented in this case did not warrant an intervention of his sua sponte authority to reopen the proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In the appellate brief, the respondent’s attorney indicates that he was removed to Honduras on an unknown date. See Respondent’s Br. at 4. We have been unable to verify this contention via the administrative records of this agency.

2

The respondent’s NTA did not include the date and time of the hearing but the Immigration Judge found without clear error that it reflects that he was informed in English and Spanish of the consequences of failing to appear and of the need to update his address (IJ at 2). The NTA need not include the specific time and date of a removal hearing in order for the statutory notice requirements to be satisfied, and that information may be provided in a subsequent notice of hearing. See Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir. 2009).

This claim for relief was not raised in the motion to reopen but we will nevertheless address it since the respondent appears to argue that the failure to do so was based on ineffective assistance of counsel.

IN RE: ARNULFO DIEGO MARTINEZ A.K.A. ARNULFO MARTINEZ DIEGO
File: AXXX XX0 293 - Charlotte, North Carolina
February 28, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
H. Esteban Diaz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Hilary Rainone
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s July 31, 2017, decision which denied his motion to reopen his removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a response in opposition. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was placed in removal proceedings with the issuance of a Notice to Appear on February 23, 2016 (Exh. 1). His counsel filed a motion to appear by telephone which was granted by the Immigration Judge on November 2, 2016, for all master calendar proceedings. The respondent appeared at a master calendar hearing on November 9, 2016, with counsel (via telephone), and conceded the charge of removability (IJ at 1). The respondent was instructed to file all applications for relief by the next hearing, which was scheduled for March 20, 2017, and he was advised that a failure to file any applications would constitute a waiver of these applications (IJ at 1).
 
On March 6, 2017, the respondent’s counsel filed a motion to continue, which was granted, and the hearing was continued until April 10, 2017. His counsel indicated in the motion that he had requested that the DHS exercise prosecutorial discretion to administratively close the proceedings.
 
On April 10, 2017, the respondent appeared with counsel (via telephone), he indicated that he would not file any applications for relief, he did not apply for pre-conclusion voluntary departure and he waived appeal (IJ at 1). The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed to Mexico in a preprinted minute order which included handwritten notations reflecting that the respondent “waived filing applications for relief and that counsel “concedes no appealable issues.”
 
On June 16, 2017, the respondent, through present counsel, filed a motion to reopen, along with an affidavit dated May 26, 2017. He requested reopening because he alleged that his prior counsel had committed ineffective assistance by not applying for cancellation of removal. The respondent attached a copy of a bar complaint filed with the North Carolina State Bar against his prior attorney dated May 26, 2017, and a May 31, 2017, letter from the bar indicating that his complaint had been received. The letter indicated therein that the bar “may also contact” his prior attorney for a response.
 
*2 On July 31, 2017, the Immigration Judge denied the motion. He noted that, although the respondent provided evidence that he filed a bar complaint against prior counsel, he had not established that his prior attorney had been notified of the complaint, or was provided an opportunity to respond (IJ at 2). Therefore, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not demonstrated his compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) to establish ineffective assistance (IJ at 2). In addition, he found that he had not met his burden to show prejudice because he was provided an opportunity to file any applications for relief, and declined (IJ at 2).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The respondent made a strategic decision not to apply for cancellation of removal while his request for prosecutorial discretion was pending, and not to apply for voluntary departure at his hearing. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998) (discussing general rule of discouraging alien from revisiting prior tactical and strategic decisions). Furthermore, the respondent has not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, to establish ineffective assistance of counsel because he has not established that the state bar notified his prior attorney of his allegations, that his prior counsel was provided with an opportunity to respond, and he has not alleged or established that the actions of his prior counsel constituted egregious circumstances.1 See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741, 746 (4th Cir. 2006) (“alien who fails to satisfy any of the three Lozada requirements will rarely, if ever, be in substantial compliance”); Figeroa v. INS, 886 F.2d 76 (4th Cir. 1989) (alien must show prejudice resulted from ineffective assistance).
 
The respondent’s May 26, 2017, affidavit is written in English. It is not accompanied by an original Spanish version or a certification of translation. However, the respondent’s brief on appeal indicated that Spanish is his native language and that he does not speak English. In addition, his appeal brief and affidavit indicated that he spoke with his prior attorney’s secretary both on the telephone and in person, and that the Immigration Judge asked him about his children during the second hearing. Moreover, the respondent conceded in his affidavit that the Immigration Judge informed him that he had waived appeal at his April 10, 2017, hearing. Therefore, it appears that either the respondent is able to speak and understand some English based on his presence in this country since 1997, or that he had the assistance of an interpreter during his interactions with his attorney’s office, the Immigration Judge, and when the May 26, 2017, affidavit was prepared.2
 
*3 To the extent that the respondent requested sua sponte reopening, he has not established an exceptional situation required for sua sponte reopening. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In this regard, the respondent’s counsel alleges in his brief on appeal that the North Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct suggest that the state bar policies resulted in a copy of the respondent’s complaint being forwarded to his prior attorney, who would have 15 days to respond (Respondent’s Brief at 4-5). However, this information is not contained in the record, counsel has not attached a copy of the state bar rules, and we decline to take administrative notice. In addition, counsel’s statement on appeal cannot constitute evidence. Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Finally, the May 31, 2017, letter from the state bar indicated that the bar may contact his prior attorney.

The respondent asserts in his affidavit that he does not want his two United States citizen children to move to Mexico. However, his United States citizen children are under no obligation to relocate to Mexico solely because the respondent has been ordered removed to Mexico. Matter of A-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 275 (BIA 2007). He indicates in his cancellation application that the mother of his two United States citizen children presently resides in Mexico.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bashir Al-Nouri, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Israel, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of October 6, 2017, denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The Immigration Judge had earlier denied a motion to reopen removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia on September 26, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent’s July 27, 2017, motion to reconsider the November 14, 2012, denial of the motion to reopen was untimely. A motion for reconsideration must be filed within 30 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(6) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). In addition, the Immigration Judge correctly found the motion, if considered a motion to reopen, is numerically barred, because the respondent had filed a previous motion to reopen on October 26, 2012, which was properly denied on November 14, 2012. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that he relied to his detriment upon the statements of an individual in his attorney’s office. To the extent the respondent is alleging ineffective assistance by his attorney or a person in that office, he has not complied with the requirements to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Correa-Rivera v. Holder, 706 F.3d 1128, 1131 (9th Cir. 2013) (appeals asserting ineffective assistance claims are effectively motions to reopen); Al Ramahi v. Holder, 725 F.3d 1133, 1138-39 (9th Cir. 2013) (no error in failing to find ineffective assistance in the absence of evidentiary support required by Matter of Lozada).
 
In particular, the respondent is required to provide an affidavit describing in detail the agreement with counsel, inform counsel of the allegations and afford counsel an opportunity to respond, and report whether a complaint of ethical or legal violations has been filed with the proper authorities, and if not, why. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639. The respondent, however, has not satisfied any of these formal requirements. See Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999) (“[t]o establish ineffective assistance of counsel in a motion to reopen, an alien must” meet Lozada’s requirements). Nor do we discern any ineffective assistance plain on the face of the record. See Tamang v. Holder, 598 F.3d 1083, 1090-91 (9th Cir. 2010) (failure to satisfy Matter of Lozada requirements was fatal to ineffective assistance of counsel claim where ineffectiveness was not plain on the face of the record).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX9 744 - Atlanta, GA
February 27, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ninette M. Ponton, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jack D. Spencer
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent timely appeals an Immigration Judge’s August 11, 2017, decision denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of El Salvador. On September 1, 2005, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen, which the Immigration Judge denied on October 3, 2005. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent received proper notice, and that he had not demonstrated that his failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances (IJ at 3, Oct. 3, 2005).
 
On July 20, 2017, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen, again alleging lack of notice. He also argued ineffective assistance of counsel and sought reopening sua sponte. The Immigration Judge denied his motion, and the respondent filed a timely Notice of Appeal. On September 19, 2017, the Board denied his motion for a stay, and the respondent was removed from the United States.
 
On appeal, the respondent indicated that he would file a brief on appeal, but he did not do so. In his Notice of Appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred 1) in denying his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; 2) in denying reopening based on his meritorious applications for asylum and cancellation; and 3) in denying the motion without a hearing. The Department of Homeland Security has filed a brief seeking summary dismissal for failure to file a brief. Although the respondent cursorily preserved several issues in his Notice of Appeal, he has not meaningfully challenged these issues and has therefore waived them.1 See Lapaix v. Att’y Gen., 605 F.3d 1138, 1145 (11th Cir. 2010).
 
Even if the issues raised in the Notice of Appeal were preserved, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s second, untimely filed motion to reopen. The motion to reopen was untimely filed and number-barred. Sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A) & (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). Contrary to his assertion in his Notice of Appeal, the respondent did not seek reopening for cancellation of removal, and did not attach a cancellation application to the motion or otherwise demonstrate prima facie eligibility for such relief. Moreover, there is no exception to the time and number bar for cancellation of removal.
 
*2 Although the respondent attached an asylum application to his motion, he did not demonstrate changed country conditions or circumstances so that an exception to the time and number limitation applies (IJ, Attachment to Order, August 11, 2017). Nor did he demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief (Id.). INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 319 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
As to ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent did not demonstrate that he pursued his rights diligently over the intervening 11 years. Avila-Santoyo v. Atty Gen., 713 F.3d. 1357, 1363 n. 5 (11th Cir. 2013). See IJ, Attachment, August 11, 2017. In addition, the respondent did not comply with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Last, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny sua sponte reopening as the respondent did not show an exceptional situation justifying the exercise of the Immigration Judge’s sua sponte authority to reopen. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

On appeal, the respondent did not preserve the question of lack of notice of his hearing. As such, this issue has been abandoned. Sepulveda v. Att’y Gen., 401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005); Matter of L-G-H-, 26 I&N Dec. 365, 366 n.1 (BIA 2014).

File: AXXX XX6 914 - Atlanta, GA
February 22, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Massiel Silva, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s May 1, 2017, decision denying his October 25, 2016, motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not file a response to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility determinations, under a clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On July 27, 2016, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed to Mexico because he waived the opportunity to file his application for relief by not filing it by the deadline on March 11, 2013 (IJ at 2). See Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992); Matter of Jean, 17 I&N Dec. 100, 102 (BIA 1979); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (“If an application or document is not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application shall be deemed waived.”). On October 25, 2016, the respondent filed a motion titled “Motion to Reopen Removal Proceedings Pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988)” (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen). On May 1, 2017, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent did not comply with the requirements to inform his prior counsel of the allegations leveled against him and to give him an opportunity to respond pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639, and he did not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s performance (IJ at 2-3).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in concluding that he did not meet the procedural requirements for proving an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Respondent’s Br. at 8-9). Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639. The respondent also argues that his prior counsel’s performance prevented him timely filing his application for relief in Immigration Court and thereby prejudiced his claim for such relief (Respondent Br. at 9-10).
 
*2 We conclude that the respondent’s motion to reopen is supported by an affidavit attesting to relevant facts, evidence that the prior counsel was informed of the allegations and has been unresponsive, and a copy of the complaint filed with the Alabama State Bar (Motion to Reopen Tab C at 10-12, 17-19; Respondent’s Br. Tab C at 10-12). The respondent’s current counsel served the respondent’s prior counsel with a copy of the bar complaint (Motion to Reopen Tab C at 10-12, 17-19; Respondent’s Br. Tab C at 10-12). The respondent’s current counsel indicates that she and her staff requested the respondent’s file from his prior counsel several times between August 3, 2016 and September 9, 2016, but the requests were ignored (Motion to Reopen Tab C at 10-12). The record demonstrates that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639.
 
We also conclude that that the respondent was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s failure to prepare and file his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1229b(b)(1), by the deadline set by the Immigration Judge in 2013. Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273-74 (11th Cir. 2005) (an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must also show prejudice); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 640. The respondent’s prior counsel represented the respondent for 3 years after the deadline for filing his application for relief expired. He did not file any motions or documents regarding the respondent’s case until he filed a motion to withdraw on July 26, 2016. The record indicates that the respondent is eligible to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act (Motion to Reopen Tab D at 45-48 and Tab E at 49). Recently, the respondent’s prior counsel has been unresponsive to inquiries regarding the respondent’s case; this supports the respondent’s claim that his prior counsel was previously unresponsive as well. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
*3 FUTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

IN RE: VADIM IGOREVICH KARGUIN A.K.A. VADIM IGOREVICH KARGIN A.K.A. VADIM KARGIN
File: AXXX XX7 788 - New York, NY
February 22, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bryan C. Johnson-Xenitelis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carol A. Moore
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative decision on June 30, 2017, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s written decision denying as a matter of discretion the respondent’s application for an inadmissibility waiver under former section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), and pretermitting his adjustment of status application. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen for further consideration of his section 212(h) inadmissibility waiver application based on an additional qualifying relative, given the recent birth of his United States citizen son. The respondent also seeks reopening to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture based on his alleged sexual orientation. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The birth of the respondent’s son, particularly considering his health issues, is an additional positive consideration concerning whether the respondent merits a section 212(h) waiver as a matter of discretion (Respondent’s Mot., tab D). We also recognize that the respondent’s continuing efforts to remain sober is a positive equity (Respondent’s Mot., tabs B, F-I). Nevertheless, the medical records do not indicate that his son’s head injury will have any long term adverse neurological implications (Respondent’s Mot., tab D at 35-36, 47, 89-90, 97-100). Nor do the records show that the child’s health concerns relating to his mother’s methadone use cannot be adequately managed (Respondent’s Mot., tab D). Overall, despite the respondent’s new equities and rehabilitation efforts, the adverse factors - particularly his extensive criminal history - still outweigh the positive considerations and we do not find an adequate basis for reopening. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992) (alien must satisfy “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened the new evidence would likely change the result in the case); Poradisova v. Gonzales, 420 F.3d 70, 78 (2d Cir. 2005) (alien must establish a prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief sought in order to prevail on a motion to reopen).
 
Additionally, the respondent - for the first time - claims that he will be harmed in Russia because of his sexual orientation. But motions to reopen are not vehicles for presenting new claims that could have been raised at the hearing before the Immigration Judge. INS v. Wang, 450 U.S. 139, 141 (1981) (discussing motions to reopen); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (motions to reopen must be based on evidence that could not have been discovered or presented at the hearing before the Immigration Judge); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 2006). Similarly, we will not reopen the proceedings concerning the respondent’s assertion that the Immigration Judge may have granted his inadmissibility waiver application had she been aware of the respondent’s sexual orientation. While the respondent speculates that the Immigration Judge may have weighed the positive and negative equities differently had she been aware of the respondent’s current assertion that his sexual orientation led to his drug use relapses, he has not shown that he could not have reasonably raised this allegation before the Immigration Judge (Respondent’s Mot., tabs B at 5). Similarly, the respondent’s alleged shame concerning his bisexuality is insufficient to meet his burden of establishing that he could not have reasonably presented evidence of his sexual orientation at his hearing.
 
*2 Notwithstanding the respondent’s allegation that prior counsel deficiently represented him by not seeking relief based on the respondent’s sexual orientation, he has not meaningfully raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, as he has not shown compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).
 
Nor has the respondent submitted sufficient evidence demonstrating a material change in Russia with respect to his claims. We have taken administrative notice of the Department of State’s 2015 and 2016 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - Russia. Those reports, coupled with the evidence supporting the motion, reflect ongoing and substantially similar treatment of bisexuals since before the respondent’s July 2016 hearing (Respondent’s Mot., tab K).
 
Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eric F. Lorenzo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 7, 2017, denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear (“NTA”) was mailed to the respondent on August 20, 2009, to his last known address at 158-26 78th Ave., Fresh Meadows, NY 11366. The NTA indicated that the respondent would be notified of his hearing date by the Immigration Court. The NTA also advised of the statutory address obligations associated with removal proceedings and of the consequences of failing to provide a current address (Exh. 1). On August 20, 2009, a notice was sent to the respondent at the address provided, advising him of his hearing on December 8, 2009, in New York, NY. The notice was not returned to the court as undeliverable. The respondent did not appear at the scheduled hearing and he was removed in absentia on December 9, 2009.
 
On August 14, 2017, the respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen, claiming that medical illnesses and ineffective assistance of counsel constituted “extraordinary circumstances.” The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposed reopening. On September 7, 2017, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion for the following reasons: (1) for failure to identify the prior counsel who allegedly provided ineffective assistance of counsel and for not complying with any of the requirements for pursuing an ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988); (2) for not producing corroborating evidence of the alleged medical conditions; and (3) that despite the alleged medical issues, the respondent had opportunities to pursue his immigration case, but failed to do so.
 
On appeal, the respondent requests that we exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen his removal proceedings, alleging family hardship and seeking to apply for re-adjustment of status based on an approved marriage-based visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife (Respondent’s Br. at 7-9). We decline to exercise our discretion to reopen proceedings sua sponte because the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”).
 
*2 The respondent previously alleged that his prior counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to file a joint petition to remove the conditions on the respondent’s residency, which resulted in the issuance of the NTA and the respondent being placed into proceedings (Respondent’s Motion at 5). The respondent seems to have abandoned this argument on appeal, claiming that “several extraordinary circumstances took place which affected his ability to file his I-751 Petition,” none of which includes an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Respondent’s Br. at 5).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that even accepting the respondent’s allegations of serious health and family problems, he had numerous periods in which to attend to his immigration situation. The respondent has not established that he made reasonable efforts to determine the status of his removal proceedings in light of the fact he was placed in proceedings in 2009, which led to the issuance of an in absentia order of removal that year. Further, the respondent was taken into immigration custody in 2013, as a result of the in absentia order, and he took no action to reopen his proceedings until 4 years later. He did pursue a family-based visa petition in 2014, but has not offered a persuasive explanation for why he did not file his motion sooner or take other action. Rather, the respondent acknowledges that in light of his problems, he “simply procrastinated” in pursuing his immigration case (Respondent’s Br. at Tab A).
 
While we acknowledge that the respondent and his family will undoubtedly be subject to hardship upon any separation, the respondent he has not established circumstances so exceptional as to trigger the limited authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. at 984 (holding that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). In this regard, we point out that many aliens who have been present in the United States for a period of years have accumulated favorable equities subsequent to being ordered removed. See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216, 1217-18 (BIA 2000) (explaining that the burden is on the movant to show exceptional circumstances). Accordingly, the request will be denied.
 
Insofar as the respondent asserts in his Notice of Appeal (“NOA”) that he did not receive notice of his hearing, this is not supported by the record. The record reflects that all the notices, including the in absentia order, were mailed to the respondent’s last known address of record and he continues to reside at the same address. Moreover, he has not submitted an affidavit or any other evidence to establish that either notice was not properly delivered to the last known address to rebut the presumption of proper delivery. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c)-(d); Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008) (setting forth the standards for determining whether an alien has presented sufficient evidence to overcome the weaker presumption of delivery that attaches to notices sent by regular mail); Matter of C-R-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 677 (BIA 2008) (holding that the respondent overcame presumption of delivery by regular mail where he submitted affidavit stating he did not receive the notice, as well as evidence he had incentive to appear and exercised due diligence in promptly obtaining counsel and requesting reopening of the proceedings). The respondent therefore had notice of his immigration proceedings and we decline to reopen proceedings on this basis.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas A. Grannan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mary C. Lee
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before us on August 28, 2017, when we entered an order dismissing the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen his removal proceedings. On September 22, 2017, the respondent submitted the instant timely motion for reconsideration pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. He requests reinstatement of his proceedings on appeal. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider shall specify errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority. See section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(6)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). The respondent has not presented a material factual or legal error in our prior decision. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Moreover, he has not otherwise persuaded us to change our decision to dismiss his appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. at 56-58; Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991) (the very nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of France. On April 4, 2014, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent to be removed to France. The record reflects that the respondent was removed from the United States on March 6, 2015. On January 6, 2017, the respondent submitted to the Immigration Judge a motion to reopen based on a claim that sua sponte reopening was warranted because the DHS and other agencies violated statutes, regulations, and procedures by failing to process his application for citizenship, and a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge denied the motion based on a lack of jurisdiction, and we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from that decision.
 
The respondent seeks reconsideration. He argues that the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Desai v. Att’y Gen., 695 F.3d 267 (3d Cir. 2012), which strips the Board of jurisdiction to reopen proceedings sua sponte if the alien has been removed from the United States, when read alongside the Third Circuit’s decision in Prestol Espinal v. Att’y Gen., 653 F.3d 213 (3d Cir. 2011), indicates that there are exceptions to the post-departure bar to reopening in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d). He contends that his motion to reopen is based on his fundamental right to effective assistance of counsel, thus making it a “statutory” motion, and that his delay in filing his motion to reopen should be excused. However, neither the present nor the prior motion set forth a claim of ineffective assistance compliant with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 We thus find no basis to reconsider our prior decision or to reinstate the respondent’s proceedings on appeal. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Katherine M. Dittmeier Holm, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anastasie M. Senat
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Bosnia-Herzegovina, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s September 5, 2017, decision finding her removable as charged and denying her request for a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent first challenges the Immigration Judge’s finding that she is removable as charged (IJ at 2).1 The record reflects, however, that the respondent’s counsel before the Immigration Judge conceded the charge of removability at her final hearing on August 30, 2017. The respondent initially denied the charge of removability on July 19, 2017 (Tr. at 6). However, at the August 30, 2017, hearing, in response to the Immigration Judge’s inquiry of whether he thought the respondent’s conviction is an aggravated felony for theft, the respondent’s counsel stated that he agreed with the government (Tr. at 13-14). Based on this assertion, we conclude that the respondent conceded the charge of removability before the Immigration Judge.
 
The respondent has not established why she should not be bound by her attorney’s concession. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (“Absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made before, during, or even after a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity binds his client as a judicial admission.”). Notably, the respondent has not raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on appeal in compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Alternatively, we would affirm the Immigration Judge’s finding that the DHS established respondent’s conviction under KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.030, theft by unlawful taking, qualifies as an aggravated felony theft offense under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G) (IJ at unmarked 2; Tr. at 14).
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was convicted of the offense of theft of a controlled substance and was sentenced to 1 year of incarceration (IJ at 1). The respondent concedes on appeal that subsection (1)(a) of KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.030 meets the generic definition of theft (Respondent’s Br. at 10). See Matter of Garcia-Madruga, 24 I&N Dec. 436, 440 (BIA 2008). However, she argues that subsection (1)(b) does not meet the generic definition, rendering the statute overbroad (Respondent’s Br. at 10-12).
 
*2 Assuming arguendo the statute is overbroad, the weight of the evidence points to the conclusion that the statute is divisible. Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243 (2016). Kentucky’s jury instructions for the offense of theft of a controlled substance closely track the language of KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.030(1)(a), which the respondent agrees meets the federal definition of a theft (Respondent’s Br. at 10). See 1-6 Cooper & Cetrulo, Kentucky Jury Instructions § 6.18C.2 Further, upon review of the respondent’s conviction record “for the sole and limited purpose of determining whether the listed items are elements of the offense,” the language of the indictment also tracks the statutory language found at KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.030(1)(a) (Exh. 2 at 8). See Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. at 2256-57 (internal quotations omitted).
 
The respondent argues that Kentucky case law establishes that KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.030 is indivisible (Respondent’s Br. at 12-13). In support of this argument, the respondent cites to Cooley v. Commonwealth, 821 S.W.2d 90, 91 (Ky. 1991), and Commonwealth v. Day, 559 S.W.2d 166 (Ky. 1980). However, the discussion within Cooley v. Commonwealth, 821 S.W.2d at 91, compares the relationship between KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.030(1)(a) and KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.110, and the analysis in Commonwealth v. Day, 559 S.W.2d at 166, solely considers subsection (1)(a) of KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.030. Neither decision discusses a comparison between subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) of KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 514.030.
 
Finally, the respondent contests the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny her request for a continuance (IJ at 2-3; Respondent’s Br. at 13-15). An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance for good cause shown. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. A decision to deny a motion for a continuance will not be reversed unless the alien establishes that the denial caused her actual prejudice and harm and materially affected the outcome of her case. Matter of Villarreal-Zuniga, 23 I&N Dec. 886, 891-92 (BIA 2006); see also Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983). Further, when requesting a continuance for the purpose of obtaining and presenting additional evidence, the applicant must support such a request by establishing that “any additional evidence he seeks to present is probative, noncumulative, and significantly favorable.” Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. at 356.
 
*3 The respondent requested a continuance at her August 30, 2017, hearing for the purpose of awaiting resolution of her request in state court to obtain post-conviction relief (IJ at 2-3; Tr. at 14-17). The record reflects that the respondent was previously granted a continuance on July 19, 2017, in order to await the resolution of her request for post-conviction relief and to research the issue of removability (IJ at 2; Tr. at 9-11). The Immigration Judge appropriately denied any further continuance.
 
Further, the respondent has not established that she was prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s denial of her request for a continuance. As noted above, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent is removable. She has not submitted evidence on appeal reflecting that there have been judicial rulings altering the status of her conviction. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996) (“[T]he Immigration Judge and this Board cannot entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to determine the guilt or innocence of the alien.”).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

After correctly noting the removability charge as reflected in the Notice to Appear, the Immigration Judge stated that the sustained the charge of removability based on a crime involving moral turpitude (IJ at 1-2). This appears to be a typographical error.

We note that it makes sense that the jury instructions track the language of subsection (1)(a), as it seems improbable that a controlled substance would be “immovable property.”

IN RE: MERCY MUMBURA
File: AXXX XX8 491 - Atlanta, GA
February 13, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eli A. Echols, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Kenya, appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated May 9, 2017, which denied her motion to reopen removal proceedings held in absentia. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the Board) (Lozada). She argued the Immigration Judge erred when he failed to accept the prior counsel’s admission concerning advising the respondent of the wrong date of the removal hearing, 2016 vs. 2017, as substantial compliance with Lozada.
 
A successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy certain conditions. First, the claim must comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639. Briefly, the Lozada requirements are (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit detailing counsel’s failings, (2) that counsel be informed of the allegations, and (3) that the motion show that disciplinary charges were filed with the appropriate authority. Id.; see also Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir. 2003) (finding the alien did not substantially comply with Lozada requirements, and therefore was not entitled to reopen removal proceedings based on claim that he suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel during his appeal to BIA).
 
Here, the respondent did not fulfill the procedural requirements for such claims as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 638-39. The record is devoid of an affidavit from either the respondent or counsel concerning the events or conversations that took place surrounding the scheduled hearing date. We recognize that prior counsel was informed of the issues concerning the in absentia finding by the Court, as he submitted the motion to reopen, which explained that he did not advise the respondent of actual hearing date (Respondent’s Br. at 4). However, the respondent has not made such an assertion, and statements made by counsel in a brief or motion are not considered evidence and, thus, are not entitled to any evidentiary weight. See Matter of S-M-, 22 I&N Dec. 49, 51 (BIA 1998); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505-6 (BIA 1980) (finding that “[c]ounsel’s arguments are not evidence . . .”).
 
*2 Nevertheless, the respondent’s motion to reopen indicated, “Respondent and Counsel erroneously thought the new Court date was February 25, 2017,” without detailing how the respondent learned about her hearing date (Respondent’s Br. at 4). Further, the respondent did not proffer an affidavit detailing her counsel’s failings at the Immigration Court level or on appeal with the Board. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639. In addition, there is no evidence the respondent filed a complaint with the appropriate authority that detailed prior counsel’s insufficient actions in her case. Id; Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d at 1222 (finding that substantial compliance is not found where a respondent does not submit a sworn affidavit attesting to the relevant facts of his ineffective assistance claim, nor has he provided his former counsel with notice and an opportunity to respond). As the respondent did not substantially comply with the Lozada requirements concerning the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we will not disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision, and will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Michelle N. Mendez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Donald W. Cassidy
Associate Legal Advisor
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 On October 11, 2017, this Board determined that the respondent’s appeal was untimely filed and that the appeal should be dismissed for that reason.1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider and remand. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the motion, and the respondent has filed a reply.2 The motion will be granted, and the record will be remanded.
 
The record establishes that the respondent’s appeal was filed over 2 years after the 30-day appeal period set out at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b), (c). The Notice of Appeal, however, was accompanied by a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by Christopher Taylor, Esquire. The Notice of Appeal did not include sufficient documentation to show that the respondent had complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). However, on September 20, 2017, the respondent filed an emergency motion to stay removal and additional documents in support of the respondent’s appeal. These documents included the bar complaint filed against Attorney Taylor and a statement by the respondent concerning both her claim of ineffective assistance and an explanation of why she was still working with the attorney and the attorney’s law firm until a short time before she filed the untimely appeal. The respondent asserts, among other things, that the attorney did not file an asylum application on her behalf even though she feared return to El Salvador and that the attorney sought only a removal order, contrary to her understanding of what the attorney had been paid to do. In this regard, the respondent observes that her contract was in Spanish except for the form of relief she would be seeking, which was in English (Mot. to Reconsider, Exh. A at 5-6). She states that the English was not translated or explained to her (Id.). She states that she would not have paid an attorney for a removal order (Id.).
 
It does not appear that the additional documents filed by the respondent on September 20, 2017, were considered by this Board prior to the issuance of our decision on October 11, 2017. Furthermore, the Board’s last decision did not address the previously filed response by the law firm to another complaint, in which there was an apparent admission that the firm policy was that persons from Central American countries generally did not have a valid claim to asylum so the firm did not file asylum applications except in rare cases and instead accepted client fees for the purpose of seeking delays in the client’s removal.
 
*2 Given that the respondent substantially complied with Lozada before our last decision was issued, that decision will be reconsidered.3 Upon reconsideration, we conclude that the respondent has sufficiently established ineffective assistance of counsel. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1272-74 (11th Cir. 2004). Although two attorneys at the law firm representing the respondent wrote letters denying the allegations against them (Emergency Motion to Stay Removal filed Oct. 30, 2017, Exh. K at 53, 57), we note that the respondent has produced documents that call into question the statements in the letters. For example both letters report that the respondent did not show up for her immigration check-in on May 24, 2017, but the respondent produced evidence that she did appear (Mot. to Reconsider Exh. E at 49). The respondent claims that it was the attorneys who did not show up to meet with her at the check-in even though an attorney was supposed to go with her (Mot. to Reconsider, Exh. A at 13).4 Based on the evidence before us, it appears that the respondent sought to apply for asylum and might have qualified for asylum but was not given the chance to present her case due to the ineffective assistance she received.
 
Furthermore, we find that the respondent has demonstrated due diligence in pursuing her case such that equitable tolling applies to the filing deadline for the respondent’s appeal. See Ruiz-Turcios v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 717 F.3d 847, 851 (11th Cir. 2013) (holding that an alien is entitled to equitable tolling generally where he shows that he has been pursuing his rights diligently and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way); Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Att’y. Gen., 713 F.3d 1357, 1363 (11th Cir. 2013). The respondent explained that her attorneys convinced her that her case was not over and that they were still working to assist her (Filing Dated Sept. 20, 2017, Exh. F).
 
Finally, while the respondents could have filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge alleging ineffective assistance as opposed to an appeal with the Board, the particular circumstances presented by this matter persuade us to accept the respondents’ appeal on certification. We find that a remand is warranted to allow the respondents to have a hearing on the application for asylum and related relief.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ motion to reconsider is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated October 11, 2017, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondents’ appeal is taken on certification and upon consideration of the appeal, the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dana Roxana Bucin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Leigh Mapplebeck
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 By an untimely motion received by the Board on August 16, 2017, the respondent seeks to have these proceedings reopened. The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on October 27, 2005. By a decision of that date, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the decision of an Immigration Judge of November 29, 2004, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status. The respondent was barred from obtaining such relief by section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d) (failure to depart after receiving voluntary departure). The respondent had been previously afforded the privilege of voluntary departure by a Stipulated Agreement Requesting Voluntary Departure in Lieu of Removal, signed by the respondent and his legal representative on June 22, 1999. The respondent failed to depart as required.
 
In support of the motion now before the Board, the respondent has failed to submit an application for relief as required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Further, the respondent also attempts to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel but has failed to comply with the requirements for asserting such a claim. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988).
 
Finally, the respondent argues that the proceedings must be reopened and terminated because they were improvidently initiated by the Notice to Appear issued on December 7, 1998. The respondent bases this argument on the fact that he was charged with removability pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), as inadmissible at the time of his adjustment of status pursuant to section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. § 1182 (a)(7)(A)(i)(I). Citing Ortiz-Bouchet v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 714 F.3d 1353 (11th Cir. 2013), the respondent argues that the aforenoted charge was facially defective because the stated ground of deportability is inapplicable to those, like the respondent, who sought post-entry adjustment of status.1 We disagree and further note that the aforenoted case is not controlling in the jurisdiction within which these proceedings arise.
 
*2 The Board considers adjustment of status as a form of “admission,” not only for purposes of determining inadmissibility and removability but also for purposes of establishing eligibility for relief from removal. See Matter of Chavez-Alvarez, 26 I&N Dec. 274, 276 (BIA 2014). Therefore, the charge lodged against the respondent was appropriate and we find no basis to terminate these proceedings.
 
There being no basis for the sua sponte reopening of this matter, or for any exception to the regulatory time limits placed on motions to reopen, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent submitted an application for adjustment of status on March 21, 1997, as a derivative of an application filed on behalf of his father. The respondent’s application was approved in error on January 8, 1998, insofar as the respondent attained the age of 21 August 1, 1997, and did not qualify as a derivative beneficiary. While the respondent now contends that his adjustment of status was valid because he was under 21 when his father’s visa petition was approved, he conceded removal in a stipulation entered in 1999. We will not revisit the question.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David Asa Borts, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Bianca Bansal
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Peru, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s July 17, 2017, decision denying his motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has filed a response in opposition to the respondent’s appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
An Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia on July 8, 2002, because he failed to appear for the hearing. The Immigration Judge also held that the respondent had failed to submit a complete motion for change of venue that complied with local rules. On April 11, 2017, the respondent filed a motion to reopen alleging that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance because she failed to submit a complete motion for change of venue and led the respondent to believe that he did not have to appear for his hearing in Texas because the case had been transferred to another Immigration Court. He also alleged in the motion that he is married to a United States citizen and is eligible for adjustment of status. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, finding that the motion is untimely, that the respondent cannot qualify for an exceptional circumstances exception to the deadline, that he did not allege equitable tolling of the deadline and would not qualify for such tolling because he did not comply with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and did not exercise due diligence in pursuing his rights. In addition, the Immigration Judge found that sua sponte reopening is not warranted (IJ at 2-4).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues the Immigration Judge’s July 8, 2002, order of removal is evidence of his prior attorney’s ineffective assistance because the Immigration Judge noted in the order that the attorney failed to submit a complete motion for change of venue. The respondent also attaches to his appeal new evidence containing an unsworn declaration from his prior attorney, the respondent’s declaration, and evidence obtained from the record of proceedings through a Freedom of Information Act request. The respondent argues that this evidence shows ineffective assistance of his prior attorney and that the Board should reopen and remand.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. First, the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely because it was not filed within 180 days of the in absentia removal order, and the respondent has not established exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1), or lack of proper notice of the hearing. See section 240(b)(5) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
*2 Further, we agree the Immigration Judge that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel could provide a basis for equitable tolling of the 180-day deadline. See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 343-44 (5th Cir. 2016); Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 798 (5th Cir. 2007). However, the respondent did not allege equitable tolling in his motion to reopen, and he would still have to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d sub nom. Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not comply with the requirements, and we will not consider new evidence on appeal (IJ at 3); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27, 36-37 (BIA 1995); Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948, 953 (5th Cir. 2012) (requiring strict compliance with Lozada). Moreover, as the Immigration Judge found the respondent would not qualify for equitable tolling because he waited almost 15 years to file his motion to reopen and did not show that he exercised due diligence in pursuing his rights (IJ at 3); Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d at 344 (alien must show he pursued his rights with reasonable diligence and that some extraordinary circumstances beyond his control prevented him from timely filing).
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to establish an exceptional situation warranting sua sponte reopening of his removal proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas D. Nelson, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 21, 2017, which found that he had abandoned his opportunity to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1), but granted his request for voluntary departure. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion denied.
 
The record shows that during the September 8, 2016, hearing the Immigration Judge explained to the respondent and counsel that he set a deadline of December 7, 2016, for the filing of the application (IJ at 1-2; Tr. at 31). During the next hearing, the Immigration Judge extended the deadline and advised the respondent and counsel that his application must be filed no later than March 17, 2017 (IJ at 1-2; Tr. at 39-40). In his June 21 2017, decision, the Immigration Judge observed that no application had been tiled and deemed it abandoned (IJ at 1-4). For the reasons provided in the written decision, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination to deem the application abandoned (IJ at 1-4). 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1003.31(c). On appeal, the respondent, through counsel, concedes that the application was not filed with the Court, but explains that “counsel has committed a mistake,” and counsel seeks to take full responsibility for the failure to file (Respondent’s Brief at 5). To the extent the respondent is alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, we find no “substantial compliance” with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Castillo-Perez v. I.N.S., 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000), Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
Turning to the respondent’s motion to reopen, we construe it as a motion to remand because it was filed during the pendency of this appeal. Although the respondent has finally submitted a copy of the application with his motion, the motion is denied. This Board is an appellate body charged with reviewing determinations made by Immigration Judges. We discern no error by the Immigration Judge in deeming the application abandoned. Further, the respondent has not met his heavy burden or demonstrated prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1992) (explaining that a party who seeks a remand or to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case).
 
*2 permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond mat time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent tails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 12S2, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

IN RE: EDGAR EDIBERTO RAMOS-HERRERA
File: AXXX XX3 755 - Atlanta, GA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Noemi Puntier, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jack D. Spencer
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals the September 6, 2017, order of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent was previously ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on June 8, 2017. Section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The appeal will be sustained, proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in determining that he did not establish exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. The respondent asserts that his failure to appear for the hearing was beyond his control, because during the prior hearing the Spanish court interpreter erroneously translated the date of the scheduled hearing and the respondent’s former counsel did not notify him of the correct hearing date.
 
An order issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The term “““exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed on July 7, 2017. Thus, the respondent’s motion to reopen is timely filed. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “““exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). In his affidavit, the respondent stated that the court interpreter stated in Spanish that the scheduled hearing would be on August 8, 2017. The respondent’s former counsel acknowledged in a signed declaration that he properly received the notice of hearing for June 8, 2017, but failed to notify the respondent of the scheduled hearing. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). The respondent’s former counsel also did not appear in Immigration Court on June 8, 2017, because of his representation in a juvenile court on that date; he did not realize that he missed the scheduled hearing until he received the Immigration Judge’s order. Finally, the respondent’s former counsel, in his declaration, stated that he listened to the audio recording from the August 4, 2016, hearing and that he heard the interpreter translate the scheduled hearing on June 8, 2017 as “ocho Agosto.”
 
*2 Based on the evidence of record, we conclude that the respondent has established ineffective assistance of counsel for his failure to appear. See Dakane v. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2004) (requiring an alien to demonstrate “substantial, if not exact, compliance with the procedural requirements of Lozada”). Moreover, we note that the respondent had an incentive to appear for the hearing, as the respondent received an approval notice dated December 13, 2016, for his Form I-360 petition for Special Immigrant Juveniles.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the in absentia order of removal is rescinded, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gary D. Spencer, Esquire1
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margaret LaDow
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand; continuance
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Vietnam who appeals from a January 31, 2017, Immigration Judge decision finding him removable as charged2 and denying his request for a continuance. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s most recent request for a motion to continue after concluding that the respondent had not demonstrated good cause for another continuance. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal and deny his motion.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, under the “““clearly erroneous” standard and we review all other issues de novo, including questions of law, discretion, and judgment. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii); Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002).
 
The respondent was admitted to the United States on or about February 27, 2007, as a lawful permanent resident. On appeal, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge erred and denied his right to due process by denying his request for a motion to continue when he had a prima facie case for post-conviction relief. He asserts that his first counsel was ineffective because he did not file an application on his behalf.
 
A party seeking a continuance has the burden to establish good cause for a continuance. See Matter of Sanchez Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 812-14 (BIA 2012); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 790-93 (BIA 2009); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 355-56 (BIA 1983); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. In determining whether good cause exists to continue proceedings, an Immigration Judge may consider a variety of factors, including (1) the Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) response to the motion; (2) whether the underlying application for relief is prima facie approvable; (3) whether the respondent is statutorily eligible for and deserving of the requested relief; and (4) whether the respondent presents a valid reason for the continuance, and other procedural factors. Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. at 790.
 
In the case at bar, the respondent first appeared before an Immigration Judge on September 8, 2015. An interpreter was not available so the proceedings were continued until January 6, 2016. Tr. at 2-4. On January 6, 2016, the Immigration Judge continued the proceedings in order for the respondent to have an opportunity to secure counsel (Tr. at 12). On September 26, 2016, the respondent appeared before the Immigration Judge with counsel and conceded the charge involving a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance (Tr. at 15-17, 20). The respondent’s counsel told the Immigration Judge that he intended to apply for cancellation of removal for certain lawful permanent residents and the Immigration Judge informed counsel that he needed to submit the completed application at the next hearing or it would be deemed abandoned (Tr. at 20-24).
 
*2 On January 31, 2017, the respondent’s counsel told the Immigration Judge that the respondent had retained separate counsel in order to pursue post-conviction relief because his criminal counsel did not provide warnings with regard to the possible immigration consequences of pleading guilty. The respondent’s counsel asked for a six-month continuance in order to complete his motion for post-conviction relief and then move to terminate. Tr. at 30-31; IJ at 2. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s most recent request for a continuance, concluding that he had not demonstrated good cause shown because a pending post-conviction motion generally does not negate the finality of the conviction for immigration purposes. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had not filed his post-conviction relief. IJ at 2.
 
Upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s most recent request for a continuance. He was granted several continuances over approximately a year and a year in order to hire an attorney and file any applications for relief. At the time of the last hearing below, the respondent indicated that he had hired another attorney in order to pursue post-conviction relief, but had not actually filed any documents with the criminal court. The respondent also did not submit other relevant evidence to his plea agreement or any documents which might support his claim that he had not been advised of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea. Moreover, the respondent plead guilty to and was convicted of attempted violation of the controlled substance act, manufacture of marijuana, in violation of WASH. REV. CODE. ANN. §§ 9A.28.020 and 69.50.41(1)(2)(C), on October 2, 2009 (Exh. 2). There is no indication in the record, nor does the respondent contend, that he appealed that conviction. Thus, it became a final conviction once the 30-day appeal period passed.
 
The Supreme Court held in Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 368-75 (2010), that an alien must be advised of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea. Critically, however, that rule is not retroactively applied, and only pertains to convictions that are final after the March 31, 2010, Padilla decision. Chaidez v. U.S., 568 U.S. 342, 348-355 (US 2013). This respondent’s conviction became final in November 2009, several months before Padilla was issued. Thus, he does not fall under the umbrella of its prospective rule, and the respondent has not demonstrated he is prima facie eligible for post-conviction relief. Id. Therefore, the respondent did not demonstrate good cause for another continuance below, and we will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s most recent motion to continue. Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. at 790-93. For the foregoing reasons, we determine that the proceedings below were fair to the respondent, and that he has not demonstrated a statutory or regulatory violation.
 
*3 The respondent asserts that his first counsel was ineffective because he did not file an application for cancellation of removal or a brief in support of possible relief. An ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be supported by (1) an affidavit from the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel regarding the matters the attorney was retained to address, (2) documentary evidence that the counsel in question was informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond, and (3) proof that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to the alleged ineffective assistance (and if this is not filed, why it was not). Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Strict compliance of these steps is not required where the ineffective assistance is “plain on the face of the administrative record.” Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 597 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal citation omitted).
 
Here, the respondent did not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada nor is the respondent’s former counsel’s purported ineffectiveness plain on the face of the record. The respondent submitted a declaration regarding his experience with his former counsel as well as a copy of a bill indicating partial payment for services rendered by the first counsel (Respondent’s Br. at Exhs. E, AA). The respondent did not provide evidence that the counsel was informed of the allegations against him or that a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Thus, the respondent has not substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada. Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d at 598-99.
 
We also conclude that the record does not show a “clear and obvious” case of ineffective assistance. Rodriguez Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002). The Immigration Judge informed the respondent that his criminal conviction likely rendered him ineligible for cancellation of removal (Tr. at 3, 13, 20-22). Thus, it was not obvious ineffective assistance for the respondent’s counsel to attempt to seek post-conviction relief in order to vacate the conviction for immigration purposes. However, this respondent would not actually be eligible for Padilla post-conviction relief because his conviction was final before that case was issued. Chaidez v. U.S., 568 U.S. at 348-355. Further, the respondent has not indicated on appeal that he actually ever sought post-conviction relief with the criminal court on any basis, undermining his argument that he is eligible for it.
 
*4 Accordingly, the following order will be issued.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed and his motion to remand is denied.

IN RE: MIR MUSTAFA ALI
File: AXXX XX1 971 - Buffalo, NY

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Caroline L. Doss, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 6, 2017, denying his motion to reopen these removal proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on April 2, 2014.1 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not file a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 722-23 (BIA 1999).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he did not receive notice of the hearing on April 2, 2014, because his first counsel did not inform him that he was required to appear (Respondent’s Br.). The respondent asserts that his first counsel’s submission of two defective motions demonstrates ineffective assistance without need of further inquiry (Id.). The respondent argues that his second counsel filed a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel but the motion was not in compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (Id.). The respondent also indicated that he intends to apply for a U Visa (Id.).
 
The respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear, advised of his address obligations, and the Notice of Hearing (NOH) was sent to the address he provided on the Form I-830, Notice to EOIR: Alien Address (IJ at 1; Exh. 1, NOH dated September 19, 2013). The respondent argues that he demonstrated a lack of notice or exceptional circumstances for not attending the scheduled hearing on April 2, 2014 (IJ at 1). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Ineffective assistance of counsel may constitute such an exceptional circumstance if the ineffective assistance results in an alien’s failure to appear at his hearing. See Arts v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 599 (2d Cir. 2008). We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion to reopen based on his claim of ineffective assistance of two prior counsels does not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639-40 (BIA 1988). The respondent submitted an affidavit detailing his communications with his prior counsels. However, the respondent did not submit copies of letters sent to the two prior counsels whose performance he deemed deficient. Thus, the respondent’s prior counsels, whose integrity or competence is being impugned, were not given an opportunity to respond to the charges against them. Id. The respondent did not file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding the allegedly deficient representation or explain his failure to do so. See Ruiz-Martinez v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 102, 121 (2d Cir. 2008) (recognizing that, while “slavish adherence” to Matter of Lozada is not required, when an alien does not comply with those requirements in any respect, the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is forfeited). We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not demonstrate that his first counsel prevented the respondent from appearing at the hearing held on April 2, 2014, or that the second counsel provided him ineffective assistance that prejudiced his claim (IJ at 1).
 
*2 We also deny the respondent’s request to reopen proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal based on his intent to pursue a U Visa application (Form I-918) with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The respondent has not provided evidence that he submitted a U visa application to USCIS or that the application was received, such as by a Notice of Action (Form I-797). For the reasons stated above, the respondent has not demonstrated an appropriate basis to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on April 2, 2014.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

On January 5, 2017, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s prior motion to reopen the in absentia order of removal entered on April 2, 2014, concluding the his failure to appear was due to his failure to notify the Immigration Court of his change of address. The Immigration Court mailed the Notice of Hearing to the address that the respondent provided and it was returned as not deliverable. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent was advised in the Notice to Appear and in the Form I-830, Notice to EOIR: Alien Address, to notify the Court of any change in his address but he did not do so. The respondent did not appeal.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Divyesh Gopal, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mahdi J. Abdelaziz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 11, 2017, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for his hearing on June 5, 2017. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the respondent’s appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i),(ii).
 
The record indicates that notice of the respondent’s June 5, 2017, hearing was mailed to the respondent’s last known address on March 7, 2017 (Exh. 2). The respondent states in an affidavit appended to his motion to reopen that he signed a contract with his attorney on May 12, 2017, in which his attorney “““agreed to send a motion for telephonic hearing” for the June 5, 2017, master calendar. The respondent further stated that his attorney told him he only had to present himself at his office on the day of the hearing because the hearing “““would be by telephone if the Immigration Judge allowed it.” The respondent does not indicate that he had any additional interactions with his attorney to confirm the telephonic hearing. In his motion to reopen, the respondent maintains that he appeared at his attorney’s office on June 5, 2017, for a telephonic hearing; however, his attorney had failed to file a motion for telephonic hearing. The respondent asserts in his appeal brief that his attorney’s office called the Immigration Court on the morning of the hearing and advised a receptionist about the “oversight” and requested a telephonic hearing (See Appeal Brief at 4). The respondent claims that the Immigration Judge did not return his attorney’s telephone call or respond to his request for a telephonic hearing (See Appeal Brief at 4). The respondent asserts that his attorney’s office called the Immigration Court in the afternoon and was informed that the Immigration Judge had ordered the respondent removed in absentia. The respondent suggests that he received ineffective assistance from his counsel. The respondent continues to be represented by the same attorney.
 
An order of removal issued after in absentia proceedings may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). Section 240(e)(1) of the Act limits “exceptional circumstances” to situations involving “compelling circumstances” which are “beyond the control of the alien” such as “serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien.” We have also held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 24 I&N Dec. at 27; see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996).
 
*2 We concur with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not complied with any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Pepaj v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 725 (6th Cir. 2007); Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. at 599. As observed by the Immigration Judge, the respondent briefly details in his affidavit the agreement that he had with his attorney, but the record does not contain a copy of the agreement. Also, there is no evidence that a complaint had been filed with the proper disciplinary authority nor has the respondent provided an explanation as to why a complaint should not be filed with the proper disciplinary authority against his attorney (IJ at 3). The alien has the burden to prove exceptional circumstances. See Scorteanu v. INS, 339 F.3d 407, 411 (6th Cir. 2003). The respondent has not done so in this case.
 
We also observe that the respondent had been provided with notice of the June 5, 2017, hearing. The respondent does not indicate that he called his attorney’s office to confirm the Immigration Judge’s allowance of the telephonic hearing. A mistaken belief as to whether the hearing was going to be held telephonically does not rise to the level of being an exceptional circumstance. See Acquaah v. Holder, 589 F.3d 332, 336 (6th Cir. 2009) (court held that a mistaken belief as to the correct date of the hearing does not qualify as an exceptional circumstance); Denko v. INS, 351 F.3d 717, 723 (6th Cir. 2003); Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33 (BIA 1998) (holding that the Board applies a totality of the circumstances test for determining whether “““exceptional circumstances” prevented an alien’s appearance at a hearing). For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: CHEIKH SECK A.K.A. CHEZKH SECK
File: AXXX XX6 584 - El Paso, TX
January 30, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jaime Jasso, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reinstatement of appeal
 
*1 The record before us shows that the respondent was ordered removed from the United States to Senegal on March 19, 2007. The Immigration Judge’s order reflects that the respondent waived his right to appeal the decision. On March 26, 2007, the respondent filed a pro se appeal. On April 2, 2007, the respondent filed a letter stating that he had changed his mind, wanted “[n]o more appeal,” wanted to go to Africa, and asked the Board to deny the appeal. The Board issued a decision on April 12, 2007, stating that the respondent had withdrawn his appeal and that the record was being returned to the Immigration Court without further action.
 
On December 6, 2017, the respondent filed a motion to reinstate his appeal. The motion argues that the respondent did not actually request withdrawal of appeal in his letter but asked that his appeal be denied and further that the letter indicates an incorrect belief that the respondent could challenge the Immigration Judge’s decision from Senegal. The respondent argues that he did not write the letter but that he found someone in the detention facility who advised him and who wrote the letter. The respondent’s motion further presents several arguments as to why he should not have been found subject to removal and that even if he were subject to removal, he qualified for relief that he had no opportunity to pursue.
 
Insofar as the respondent’s motion is a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider for the purpose of reinstatement of the appeal, it is untimely. Motions to reconsider must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the order from which reconsideration is sought. See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Motions to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent filed his motion more than 10 years after the Board’s last decision. Moreover, the respondent does not argue that his motion falls within any statutory or regulatory exception to the filing requirements. Nor does the respondent claim that equitable tolling applies to his motion. See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337 (5th Cir. 2016).
 
Assuming the respondent is attempting to set out a case of ineffective assistance of counsel by the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Judge, he has not demonstrated compliance with the technical requirements for ineffective assistance claims as set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and (as noted previously), has not argued that equitable tolling applies.
 
*2 Finally, the respondent has not demonstrated that proceedings should be reopened or reconsidered sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The record shows that appeal was waived in this matter. Insofar as the respondent did appeal, he has not established that the Board incorrectly deemed his appeal withdrawn. The respondent’s letter to the Board in 2007 specifically said “No more appeal” and that the respondent wanted to go to Africa.
 
Moreover, more than 10 years have passed since the Board’s last order. The record does not show that the respondent has challenged that order until now. The respondent’s motion provides no information concerning what has taken place since the Board issued its order. We have no statements about where the respondent is living, whether he was removed to Senegal, or whether he attempted to find alternative counsel to assist him with his immigration issues. We conclude that the respondent has not sufficiently established an exceptional situation that would cause us to sua sponte reopen or reconsider and then reinstate the appeal. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (explaining that sua sponte reopening is reserved for exceptional situations).
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Amy M. Crossin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; termination
 
*1 On September 20, 2013, we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s November 21, 2012, decision denying the respondent’s motion to administratively close his removal proceedings. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen to pursue adjustment of status based on an approved Form I-130 petition filed on his behalf by his United States citizen mother and a current priority date. The record before us does not contain a brief in opposition from the Department of Homeland Security. The motion to reopen and terminate will be denied.1
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and will be denied as such. With certain exceptions not pertinent here, an alien is entitled to file one motion to reopen and the motion to reopen must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed on November 17, 2017, over 4 years after the final order of removal was entered, and the record before us does not present any exceptional situation warranting sua sponte reopening (see Motion to Reopen, Exhs. 1-25). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to sua sponte reopen proceedings is reserved for “““exceptional situations” and “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship.”).
 
We acknowledge that the respondent has submitted numerous documents and statements in support of his motion, including documents regarding his ties to the United States and community, his character, and the potential hardship to his family, including his United States citizen children (see Motion to Reopen, Exhs. 2-15). However, we do not have the authority to grant relief from removal solely on equitable or humanitarian grounds. See Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734, 742 (BIA 1988).
 
Finally, to the extent the respondent is alleging that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance (Motion to Reopen, Exh. 21), he has neither complied with the procedural requirements for such a claim nor submitted evidence to justify equitable tolling. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural and substantive requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim); Pepaj v. Mukasey, 509 F3d 725, 727 (6th Cir. 2007) (stating that an alien who does not comply with the Lozada requirements forfeits his ineffective assistance of counsel claim); Tapia-Martinez v. Gonzales, 482 F.3d 417, 422 (6th Cir. 2007) (stating that equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel requires a showing of due diligence). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s untimely motion is denied.

IN RE: PETER NDUNGU CHEGE A.K.A. PETER NDUNGU
File: AXXX XX0 439 - Boston, MA
January 8, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Musa P. Sebadduka, Esquire
 
APPLICATIONS: Reopening; stay of removal
 
*1 This case was last before us on December 31, 2015, when we entered a final administrative order dismissing the respondent’s appeal. On July 14, 2017, the respondent submitted the instant motion to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. He requests a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The motion has been filed out of time, and it will be denied. The respondent’s stay request will also be denied.
 
With limited exceptions, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). In certain circumstances, an alien may toll the time limit applicable to his motion to reopen by demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In addition to complying with the procedural requirements for such a claim, the alien must show prejudice as a result of the ineffective assistance and that he exercised due diligence during the period he seeks to toll. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Kenya. He seeks reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent claims that when the Immigration Judge asked if he was going to request voluntary departure and his counsel said no, he asked his counsel what the Immigration Judge meant by voluntary departure, and his counsel replied that he would explain it after the hearing. See Exh. VIII, ¶ 10. He relates that his counsel later explained what voluntary departure meant, and stated that he did not need voluntary departure because the Immigration Judge erred and they were going to appeal his decision. Id., ¶ 11. He recounts that after his appeal was dismissed, his counsel advised him to seek review in the Circuit Court of Appeal, and said that if the Circuit Court remands his case to the Immigration Judge, he could apply for voluntary departure. Id., ¶ 13. The respondent states that he was confused and upset because his counsel was telling him that he needed to appeal one more time to achieve what the Immigration Judge had offered him at the start. Id. He reports that he agreed to pursue further appeals to the Circuit Court as a last alternative, and that on May 15, 2017, the Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the Board. Id., ¶ 15. The respondent claims that his counsel should not have appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision because he knew that he was inadmissible and barred from adjustment of status, and that he misrepresented the general outlook of his case, giving him false hope. Id., ¶¶ 16-17. He alleges that his counsel’s false representations cost him his only available option and several thousand dollars in legal fees and court costs that were not necessary, and violated the rules of professional conduct. Id., ¶¶ 18-20.
 
*2 The respondent offers his affidavit and his statement of facts, his notice to his former counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance, his counsel’s response, the bar complaint he filed against his former counsel and receipt notice, a Massachusetts record of criminal offender information, and letters from a friend and a parish vicar in the United States.
 
The respondent has not offered persuasive evidence for his claim that his counsel made false representations to him. The record reflects that the respondent agreed to proceed with the appeal and federal court review of his removal proceedings after the Immigration Judge rendered his decision in 2014. We are not convinced by the respondent’s contention at this time, years later and after his appeal has been dismissed and petition for review denied, that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by pursuing those courses of action. We conclude that, although the respondent has substantially complied with the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not demonstrated that he suffered ineffective assistance. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639; Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2004); Saakian v. INS, 252 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2001). We are not persuaded that equitable tolling of the time limit for motions to reopen is warranted in this case. See Bead v. Holder, 703 F.3d 591, 594 (1st Cir. 2013); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. at 553.
 
The motion to reopen has been filed out of time, and has not been shown to come within any exception to the timely filing requirements for motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent has not met his heavy burden to demonstrate that his removal proceedings should be reopened. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). He has not shown the exceptional circumstances necessary to warrant our granting this untimely motion in the exercise of our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, as the motion exceeds the time limit for motions to reopen, it will be denied, and the respondent’s stay request will also be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen and stay request are denied.

IN RE: JENNIFA JOSHUE A.K.A. JENNIFER JOSHUA
File: AXXX XX0 562 - Danbury, CT
January 4, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul B. Grotas, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on January 9, 2009, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely filed. On July 11, 2017, the instant untimely, number-barred motion to reopen was filed by the respondent. The motion will be denied.
 
Under the law, with certain exceptions not pertinent here, a party is limited to one motion to reopen. Section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). As this is the respondent’s second motion to reopen, it is numerically barred. The motion to reopen has also been filed more than 90 days after our decision dismissing the appeal on January 21, 2003, that resulted in a final administrative order of removal. Accordingly, as with the respondent’s previous motion, the instant motion to reopen is untimely.
 
We do not find that there are exceptional circumstances in this case that warrant reopening under our limited sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).1 Moreover, an alien’s potential eligibility for relief after the entry of a final administrative removal order is not, in and of itself, an exceptional circumstance. This is a common situation for many aliens. The respondent asserts, however, that because she was the victim of “fraud and deceit” by someone who was not an attorney, she has significant equities, and her removal would be an extreme hardship on her United States citizen husband and children, her proceedings should be sua sponte reopened (Respondent’s Motion at 14-15).
 
The respondent alleges that she paid and worked closely with an individual, Mr. Victor Espinal, who was not, in fact, an attorney. Mr. Espinal was convicted in 2009, of fraudulently representing himself as an attorney (Respondent’s Motion at 7). Despite the seriousness of these circumstances, the record indicates that Mr. Espinal did not represent the respondent in her removal proceedings; Mr. Espinal never filed a notice of appearance, Form EOIR-28, before the Immigration Court or a Form EOIR-27 before the Board on behalf of the respondent (Respondent’s Motion at 6; Exhs. D, E, M, P).2 Given the lack of representation by Mr. Espinal, we find no basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against him.
 
With regard to the allegations made against Mr. Rojas, the respondent has not sufficiently met all of the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F. 2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We find the respondent’s affidavit to be inadequate as it fails to provide adequate details about the nature of the agreement between the respondent and Mr. Rojas, and the agreed upon scope of their representation. See Piranej v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 137 (2d Cir. 2008) (remanding for further fact-finding in the context of a general retainer agreement). We have considered the other evidence submitted by the respondent, including the payment receipts and correspondence, but conclude that the respondent has not met the requirements of Lozada. Moreover, the respondent has not shown prejudice as a result of any alleged ineffective assistance, as she has not shown that the outcome of her case would likely have been different but for the claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009).
 
*2 We turn next to the respondent’s contention that the Second Circuit’s decision in Husic v. Holder, 776 F.3d 59 (2d Cir. 2015), constitutes a fundamental change in the law which renders her eligible for a discretionary waiver under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h) (Respondent’s Motion at 12). We acknowledge the change in the law. See also Matter of J-H-J, 26 I&N Dec. 563 (BIA 2015) (holding that section 212(h) of the Act only precludes aliens who entered the United States as lawful permanent residents from establishing eligibility for a waiver on the basis of an aggravated felony conviction).
 
Notwithstanding the change in law, the respondent is not currently the beneficiary of an approved Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative), so as to be prima facie eligible for adjustment of status, even if granted a section 212(h) waiver. In addition, “given the evidence of record regarding the respondent’s conviction under counts 1 and 5 of the relevant superseding indictment (Exh. 3),” we remain unconvinced that the waiver (or adjustment of status) would or should be granted in the exercise of discretion. See Decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals dated January 9, 2009.
 
For all of the foregoing reasons, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion for stay of removal is denied as moot.

IN RE: LUIS ALBERTO LOPEZ
File: AXXX XX3 311 - New York, NY
December 22, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William Lopez-Ruiz, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on September 22, 2017, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision finding his application for adjustment of status abandoned and alternatively finding the respondent statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen urging that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. He also requests a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The motion and stay will be denied.
 
Applicable regulations provide that a motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, a movant must satisfy the “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must show that competent counsel would have acted otherwise and that the alien was prejudiced. Romero v. INS, 399 F.3d 109, 112 (2d Cir. 2005); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent urges that the attorney who represented him at his hearing below was ineffective for failing to timely file his application for adjustment of status, which resulted in it being deemed abandoned. However, the Immigration Judge and the Board alternatively denied the application on its merits. Specifically, we found that the respondent did not establish the requisite parent child relationship for purposes of adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act as a derivative grandfathered alien. The respondent has not submitted any new or additional evidence to establish that he once qualified as his father’s child as defined under section 101(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1). Therefore, the respondent still has not established eligibility for adjustment of status. As such, he has not demonstrated prejudice from counsel’s actions or omissions such that he has established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has not submitted persuasive evidence that is sufficient to meet his “heavy burden” of showing that it is likely that the result would change if the proceedings were reopened. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. at 464. Therefore, we do not find that he has met his burden of showing that reopening of these proceedings is warranted.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mikhail Usher, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 This case is before us pursuant to a February 24, 2016, order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit granting the government’s unopposed motion to remand the record for further consideration. The appeal will be dismissed.1
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The government requested a remand to allow the Board to consider the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s continuance request and any other issues that we deemed appropriate. There have been many significant developments in the law surrounding the application of the categorical and modified categorical approach and the determination of whether or not a statute is divisible for purposes of determining whether a conviction is an aggravated felony. Therefore, we will address this issue in addition to the denial of the continuance.
 
We find the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent any further continuance in this case. Further, we conclude that the criminal statute at issue is divisible under current case law, and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision that the respondent’s conviction for possessing, distributing, manufacturing, dispensing a controlled dangerous drug (Oxycodone), in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:35-5(a)(1) (2013) is an aggravated felony (IJ at 2-3). Section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B).
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in whose jurisdiction these proceedings arise, has identified two “routes” to determine when a state drug conviction constitutes an aggravated felony: the “illicit trafficking” route and the “hypothetical felony” route, both tracking the statutory language. Gerbier v. Holmes, 280 F.3d 297, 305 (3d Cir. 2002) (citing Matter of Davis, 20 I&N Dec. 536 (BIA 1992)). Although we previously found otherwise, under more recent case law, we now conclude that the respondent has not been convicted of an aggravated felony pursuant to the “““illicit trafficking” route,” because under New Jersey law, “distribution” and ““dispensing” include no remuneration requirement. See Chang-Cruz v. Attorney General of the United States, 659 Fed. Appx. 114 (3d Cir. Aug. 24, 2016) (unpublished) (citing N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:35-2) and Matter of G.R., 929 A.2d 602, 605 (2007)). The conviction continues to be an aggravated felony, however, under the “hypothetical felony” route.
 
*2 Under the “hypothetical felony” route, an aggravated felony is defined in pertinent part as the “illicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act [21 U.S.C. § 802]), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18, United States Code.” Section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act (emphasis added). 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2) defines a “drug trafficking crime” as “any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act” (CSA). The United States Supreme Court has held that an offense (whether labeled a misdemeanor or a felony by the relevant jurisdiction) constitutes a drug trafficking crime if it “proscribes conduct punishable as a felony” under the CSA. Moncrieffe v. Holder, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 1683 (2013) (quoting Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 47, 60 (2006)). Thus, an offense comes within the “hypothetical felony” route when it necessarily prohibits conduct that the CSA likewise prohibits and punishes it by more than 1 year of imprisonment. Id. at 1683 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(5)).
 
In determining whether a state offense is a hypothetical federal felony, we apply the “categorical approach,” where we “focus solely on whether the elements of the crime of conviction sufficiently match the elements of [the] generic [federal offense], while ignoring the particular facts of the case.” Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243, 2248 (2016). This entails looking to whether the elements of the state statute of conviction categorically fit within the “generic” federal crime. Id. It is required to consider only the respective elements of the state and federal offenses to see whether a conviction under the state statute “‘necessarily’ involved facts equating to the generic federal offense.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 133 S.Ct. at 1684 (quoting Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 24 (2005) (plurality opinion). We do not look to the facts of the particular case, but rather look to see “whether the state statute defining the crime of conviction categorically fits within the generic federal definition of a corresponding aggravated felony.” See Singh v. Attorney General of the United States, 839 F.3d 273, 278 (3d Cir. 2016) (citing Moncrieffe v. Holder, 133 S.Ct. at 1684). Thus, under the categorical approach, the respondent’s state drug conviction is an aggravated felony if the conduct necessary to sustain a state conviction includes all of the elements of an offense that could be convicted as a felony under the CSA (21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq.). See Gerbier v. Holmes, 280 F.3d at 803.
 
*3 The Immigration Judge may depart from the categorical approach to determine whether the statute of conviction is an aggravated felony if the statute is divisible. A statute is divisible if (a) it lists multiple discrete offenses as enumerated alternatives or defines a single offense by reference to disjunctive sets of “elements,” more than one combination of which could support a conviction; and (b) some (but not all) of those listed offenses or combinations of disjunctive elements are a categorical match to the relevant generic standard. Descamps v. United States, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2283 (2013); see also United States v. Brown, 765 F.3d 278, 295 (3d Cir. 2014). Further, any facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed are elements of the crime, and must be found beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Abbott, 748 F.3d 154, 159 (3d Cir. 2014) (citing Alleyne v. United States, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2160 (2013) (quoting Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000)). In a case in which the type of controlled substance is not specified in the statute of conviction, but the type of controlled substance impacts the sentencing determination, the type of controlled substance is an element of the offense. Id. at 158-59.
 
At the time the respondent committed the offense, N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:35-5(a)(1) provided that it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or purposely to manufacture, distribute or dispense, or to possess or have under his control with intent to manufacture, distribute or dispense, a controlled dangerous substance or controlled substance analog. The analogous federal statute under the CSA is 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Wilson v. Ashcroft, 350 F.3d 377, 381 (3d Cir. 2003).
 
Although the respondent argues that the statute is not divisible under Descamps, we disagree. The statute here is divisible because the type of controlled substance involved must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury. The jury instructions for N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:35-5(a)(1) make it clear that the jury must find (a) the conduct involved; (b) the type of controlled substance involved; and (c) that the individual acted knowingly and purposefully. See N.J. J.I. Crim. § 2C:35-5. Given that more than one combination of elements could support a conviction and can impact the range of penalties, the statute is divisible, warranting application of the modified categorical approach. See Evanson v. Attorney General of U.S., 550 F.3d 284, 293 (3d Cir. 2008).
 
*4 A review of the documents in the respondent’s record of conviction establishes that the respondent pled guilty to indictment number 13-08-01039-A (Exh. 2). This indictment and the criminal accusation charge the respondent with possessing, distributing, manufacturing, dispensing a controlled dangerous drug (Oxycodone), in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:35-5(a)(1) (Exhs. 2A and 2B). Oxycodone is a Schedule II controlled substance, 21 U.S.C. § 812(c); 21 C.F.R. § 1308.12(b)(1)(xiii), and the distribution of it is punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b). As the respondent’s offense of conviction is analogous to 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), the respondent has been convicted of an aggravated felony for purposes of removability.2
 
We next consider the Immigration Judge’s denial of a further continuance. The respondent argues that he should have been provided more time to retain counsel with experience in both immigration and criminal law, in part, because he was pursuing post-conviction relief (Respondent’s Br. at 14-16, citing Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010)).3 He also argues that he was misinformed by two previous attorneys, but he has made no effort to substantially comply with the procedural requirements to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Fadiga v. Attorney General of the U.S., 488 F.3d 142, 155 (3d Cir. 2007); Matter of Compean, Bangley & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). As such, there is no basis to remand the record as the respondent requests (Respondent’s Br. at 16).
 
The respondent was served with his Notice to Appear on December 1, 2014, and first appeared before an Immigration Judge on December 24, 2014 (Tr. at 1; Exh. 1). He was given a continuance to obtain representation (Tr. at 2). One month later, on January 22, 2015, he appeared without an attorney and was granted a continuance, but was informed that he would be required to go forward without an attorney should he not have one at the next hearing (Tr. at 4). On March 10, 2015, he again requested more time to obtain representation (Tr. at 6-12). The respondent was granted additional time to prepare his application for asylum and again appeared without an attorney on March 26, 2015 (Tr. at 17-18). At this hearing, he first indicated he no longer wished to apply for asylum, but changed his mind when he learned there was no other relief from removal available to him (Tr. at 20-23). He was then granted additional time to prepare his application, but at the final hearing, on April 16, 2015, again without representation, he stated that he would not be applying for asylum (Tr. at 29). Subsequently, the Immigration Judge entered his decision.
 
*5 The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge and will not be overturned on appeal to the Board unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987); see also Melgar v. Attorney Gen. of U.S., 442 Fed. App’x 695, 699 (3d Cir. 2011). Here, the respondent was provided ample time to obtain representation and the Immigration Judge properly denied the continuance. Also, as discussed above, the respondent has not shown he is eligible for any relief from removal. The respondent has not demonstrated that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case or that substantial prejudice resulted. See Fadiga v. Attorney General of the U.S., 488 F.3d at 155; Khan v. Attorney General, 448 F.3d 226, 236 (3d Cir. 2006).
 
Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stephen C. Brown, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margaret LaDow
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s June 13, 2017, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order entered on February 6, 2016. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i)(2017). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in declining to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). The basis of the motion, which was filed on May 4, 2017, is that the respondent’s prior counsel neglected to remind him of the date and time of the February 6, 2016, hearing. The respondent argues that this amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel and thus “exceptional circumstances” excusing his absence from the February 6, 2016, hearing.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not substantially complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (IJ at 3-4). See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 597 (9th Cir. 2004) (discussing the circumstances under which compliance with these procedural requirements may be excused). In particular, the respondent’s supporting documents do not provide sufficient detail of the agreement with prior counsel, including the extent of prior counsel’s representation. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639 (providing that a party claiming ineffective assistance of counsel should provide “an affidavit . . . that sets forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken . . . and what counsel did or did not represent to the respondent in this regard”). While the supporting affidavit and text messages clearly reflect that the respondent entered into an agreement with prior counsel concerning the underlying visa petition, it is unclear if the agreement encompassed representation in these removal proceedings (IJ at 3; cf. Aff. at ¶8).1 That prior counsel retained copies of the respondent’s immigration records, including a copy of the underlying hearing notice, does not persuade us of an agreement by prior counsel to represent the respondent in these removal proceedings (cf. Respondent’s Br. at 10-11). For these reasons, we conclude that the respondent has not properly raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.2
 
*2 Even assuming the respondent has properly raised this claim, we further agree with the Immigration Judge that the motion is untimely (IJ at 2). A motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal on the basis of exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days of the date of entry the order. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. While this period may be equitably tolled as the result of ineffective assistance of counsel, the tolling period is not indefinite. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2011). Rather, once an alien “definitively learns of the harm” resulting from the complained instance of deficient performance or “obtains “‘vital information bearing on the existence of his claim”DD’, the tolling period ends and the statutory deadline begins to run. Id.; Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
The Immigration Judge concluded that the tolling period ended on February 15, 2016 (IJ at 2). Contrary to the respondent’s assertions on appeal (Respondent’s Br. at 5-6), we agree with the Immigration Judge that any tolling ended on this date. As noted in the affidavit accompanying the motion, this is the date that the respondent was advised by prior counsel that he had missed the hearing and would need to file a motion to reopen (IJ at 2; Aff. at ¶11). The respondent “““definitively learn[ed] of the harm” resulting from the complained instance of deficient performance--prior counsel’s failure to remind him of the hearing date--upon receiving this information (IJ at 2). Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d at 679. Indeed, as the respondent concedes on appeal, upon receiving this information from prior counsel, the “[r]espondent became aware of potential grave consequences of missing his hearing” (Respondent’s Br. at 6). Thus, consultation with current counsel and current counsel’s review of the respondent’s file was not necessary to definitively learn of the harm caused by the alleged misconduct of prior counsel (see id.). Cf. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d at 895.
 
As the Immigration Judge properly determined, with the tolling period ending on February 15, 2016, the 180-day deadline extended to August 15, 2016 (IJ at 2). The May 4, 2017, motion is therefore untimely.
 
We further agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated that the circumstances surrounding his failure to appear amount to “exceptional circumstances” within the meaning of the Act. “The term “‘exceptional circumstances’ refers to exceptional circumstances (such as battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien, serious illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” Section 240(e)(1) of the Act (emphasis added); see also Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, 509 (BIA 1996). The “particularized facts presented in each case” are relevant to determining whether the respondent has established “exceptional circumstances,” and the “plain language of the statute indicates that this is a difficult burden to meet.” Arredondo v. Lynch, 824 F.3d 801, 806 (9th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
 
*3 As an initial matter, we emphasize that this is not a case where the respondent was misinformed by his attorney, either that there was no hearing or that the hearing was on an incorrect date. Cf Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, 327 F.3d 892, 896 (9th Cir. 2003), as amended, 339 F.3d 1012 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472, 474 (BIA 1996). Nor is this a case where the respondent was uninformed of a hearing date after notice was provided to his attorney. To the contrary, the respondent admits receiving the Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings advising him of the February 6, 2016, hearing before the Seattle Immigration Court (Exh. 2; Aff. at ¶¶7-8). The correct hearing date and time were therefore conveyed to the respondent, and this information was not contradicted by any actions of prior counsel.
 
While we recognize that the respondent eventually gave the original copy of the hearing notice to prior counsel (Aff. at ¶¶7-10), the respondent’s later confusion about the hearing date and his own lack of record keeping were not beyond his control (IJ at 4). Furthermore, despite the respondent’s claim that prior counsel failed to respond to his inquiries regarding the hearing status, the respondent always had the option, which he never exercised, of contacting the Immigration Court to learn the details of this hearing (Id. at 3).3 Considering the record in its entirety, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances within the meaning of section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act.
 
For these reasons, we conclude that the Immigration Judge properly concluded that the respondent has not demonstrated that reopening is warranted under section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. See INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25-26 (1976) (as a general rule, courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach).
 
In conclusion, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to not exercise his sua sponte reopening authority in this case (IJ at 4). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent potentially becoming eligible for additional relief after the period for timely reopening expired does establish exceptional circumstances so as to provide a basis for granting reopening sua sponte (cf. Respondent’s Br. at 12-13). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

There is no record of prior counsel entering an appearance in these proceedings.

We do not share in the Immigration Judge’s concerns regarding the lack of notice to prior counsel and the lack of a complaint to appropriate disciplinary authorities (IJ at 3-4), in light of the evidence presented that prior counsel has been suspended from the practice of law (Mot. at 58). See Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893, 896-97 (9th Cir. 2008) (excusing compliance with these requirements as futile under similar circumstances).

Additionally, while we recognize the respondent’s contention that he did not know his alien identification number (A-number) (Aff. at ¶10), there is is a considerable difference between being denied access to information for not providing an A-number and not making any attempt to contact the Immigration Court.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: PABLO AGUILAR-GARCIA
File: AXXX XX0 019 - San Diego, CA
December 1, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James B. Rudolph, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Amelia C. Anderson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 29, 2014, which denied his motion to reopen removal proceedings. Pursuant to the Board’s October 11, 2016, remand, the Immigration Judge issued another decision on June 22, 2017,1 further specifying the reasons for denying the motion to reopen. Thereafter, the parties provided arguments on appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record shows that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) placed the respondent in removal proceedings with personal service of the Notice to Appear on August 12, 2013, alleging that he was a native and citizen of Mexico and charging him as inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (2012) (present without being admitted or paroled) (Exh. 1). The record indicates that the respondent, who was represented by counsel, admitted the allegations and conceded the charge. On May 28, 2014, the respondent applied solely for pre-conclusion voluntary departure, which the Immigration Judge granted with an alternate order of removal to Mexico.
 
The respondent, through new counsel, filed a motion to reopen on September 30, 2014, alleging ineffective assistance from former counsel. The DHS opposed the motion. In the October 29, 2014, decision, the Immigration Judge adopted the reasoning from the DHS opposition and denied the motion to reopen without further reasoning.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s June 22, 2017, denial of the motion to reopen. The motion is untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent concedes that the motion is untimely but contends that the 90-day filing requirement should be equitably tolled on account of ineffective assistance from former counsel. However, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), because he has not filed a complaint concerning former counsel with the State bar or reasonably explained why.
 
*2 In this regard, the respondent argues that filing a bar complaint is not required because former counsel has been substantially compliant because he has responded to the letter from current counsel and because he provided a reason for not filing a motion to suppress. Respondent’s Br. at 6-7. However, in the context of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, “substantial compliance” with the Lozada requirements generally refers to substantial compliance by the complaining party, the respondent, not the attorney whose competence is being challenged.
 
In addition, to date, the respondent has not substantiated at all the allegation that he was the subject of racial or ethnic profiling by local police, which is the underlying basis for the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Thus, there is no sufficient basis to absolve the respondent from filing a State bar complaint against his former attorney or, by extension, to equitably toll the filing deadline for the motion to reopen.
 
We note that the respondent states in the brief on appeal that former counsel was suspended from the practice of law on November 13, 2014, and on December 21, 2015, and was disbarred on August 14, 2016. Respondent’s Br. at 7. However, those disciplinary actions do not relieve the respondent of complying with the bar complaint requirement when he filed his motion to reopen on September 30, 2014. See Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893, 897 (9th Cir. 2009).
 
In conclusion, we agree that the motion to reopen is untimely and that the respondent has not shown that the 90-day filing requirement should be equitably tolled. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

November 28, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Randy Alexander, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on November 30, 2016, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s January 27, 2016, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the order of removal entered in absentia on May 2, 2006. On April 24, 2017, the respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador filed the present request for reopening. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent does not dispute that the present motion exceeds the time limits applicable to motions to reopen. Rather, he contends that such limits should be equitably tolled because he received ineffective assistance from former counsel. The respondent asserts that, but for former counsel’s deficient performance, he would have succeeded on his asserted lack of proper notice claim on appeal before the Board.
 
However, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for advancing a claim against former counsel, including the requirement that he show prejudice resulting from former counsel’s alleged deficient performance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001) (noting that to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate that counsel’s performance resulted in substantial prejudice); Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F. 3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994) (proving prejudice requires the petitioner to make a prima facie showing that, absent counsel’s deficient performance, he would have been entitled to the relief the sought).
 
It is undisputed that the respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear, which included the date, time, and place of his scheduled hearing and was read to him in Spanish. As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent’s claimed inability to understand that he was required to appear in court as directed does not defeat the fact that the respondent was personally served with and received proper notice of the date, time, and place of his May 2006 scheduled hearing (I.J. at 2), which was not reversed by the Board.
 
Moreover, the respondent has proffered no argument or evidence addressing the full breadth of both the Immigration Judge’s and the Board’s reasoning, namely that the respondent did not exercise due diligence in waiting more than 9 years to file a motion to reopen and rescind the May 2006 in absentia removal order. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated that, absent counsel’s alleged deficient performance, he would have succeeded on appeal before the Board. See Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F. 3d at 85.
 
*2 Moreover, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(iv), the respondent does not need to have his removal proceedings reopened to be able to apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”). We also note that the respondent may request an administrative stay of removal from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) while any waiver or provisional waiver application is pending before the USCIS. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a).
 
The respondent has not provided an adequate basis to excuse the untimeliness of the present motion. Nor has he demonstrated an exceptional situation that would warrant reconsideration of the prior Board decision or reopening of these proceedings in the exercise of discretion under the Board’s sua sponte authority. See, e.g., Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s sua sponte power is limited to exceptional circumstances). Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN RE: ADEILSON MARTINS-SOARES

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Becki A. Jacobson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Luciana Dubuc
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 24, 2017, which denied his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on July 1, 2005. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a motion for summary affirmance in opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed (i) within 180 days after the date of the removal order if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (ii) at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 722-23 (BIA 1999).
 
On appeal, the respondent abandons his lack of notice claim. He admits that he received notice of his hearing on July 1, 2005, but he did not appear because he was afraid that he would be returned to Brazil (Respondent’s Br. at 7). On appeal, the respondent also filed a motion to remand in order to apply for asylum based on changed country conditions (Respondent’s Br. at 20-21). The respondent argues that his prior counsel provided him ineffective assistance when he failed to investigate and explore other potential applications for relief (Respondent’s Br. at 8, 15-19).
 
The respondent conceded that he received notice of his hearing on July 1, 2005, that he did not appear at the hearing to avoid removal, and that his motion to reopen was untimely (Respondent’s Appeal; Respondent’s Declaration). We therefore agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent received effective notice of the July 1, 2005, hearing. It follows that the respondent’s motion did not meet the statutory grounds for rescission of his order of removal under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
*2 An alien who is subject to an in absentia removal order need not first rescind the order before seeking reopening of the proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions arising in the country of the alien’s nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered. Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013). Although the Immigration Judge’s order did not specifically address this issue, we discern no basis for a remand, inasmuch as the respondent’s motion did not establish changed country conditions in Brazil arising after the issuance of the Immigration Judge’s decision on July 1, 2005. The respondent’s declaration indicates that he owed an unscrupulous lender a large sum of money in 2005 and that he paid off the debt he owed (Respondent’s Declaration at 3). In his declaration, he also asserted that he fears of general violence and corruption in Brazil based on reports from friends (Respondent’s Declaration at 4-5). The respondent did not provide any country conditions reports from which to compare the country conditions in Brazil in 2005 and the country conditions in 2017. Therefore, the respondent did not present prima facie evidence of changed country conditions arising in the respondent’s country of nationality or country to which removal was ordered. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 981 (BIA 1997); see also Singh v. Lynch, 840 F.3d 220, 222-23 (5th Cir. 2016) (new threats and violence experienced by the alien’s mother amounted to a change in personal circumstances); Ramos-Lopez v. Lynch, 823 F.3d 1024, 1026 (5th Cir. 2016) (noting that the alien’s briefing does not compare in any meaningful way the conditions in her home country in 1998 and 2013, therefore, she did not present material evidence of changed country conditions).
 
The respondent argues that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by filing the motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal without reviewing the respondent’s immigration file, preparing affidavits, or submitting evidence supporting the motion (Respondent’s Br. at 15-19). Based on his prior attorney’s ineffective performance, the respondent requests remand and reopening in order to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. We assume that the respondent met the procedural requirements of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the Board and requiring a showing of prejudice). However, as discussed above, the respondent did not establish that he was prejudiced because he did not establish a prima facie case showing that changed country conditions arising in Brazil since 2005 have caused him to fear future harm or persecution in Brazil in 2017. Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605, 609 (5th Cir. 2006) (finding substantial prejudice is required to show ineffective assistance of counsel); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 40.
 
*3 The respondent indicates that he is the beneficiary of an approved Petition for Alien Relative, Form I-130, filed on his behalf by his United States citizen spouse. We note that effective August 29, 2016, new rules regarding provisional unlawful presence waivers were implemented. See Expansion of Provisional Unlawful Presence Waivers of Inadmissibility, 81 Fed. Reg. 50,244, 50,255-56, 50,262 (July 29, 2016). The DHS has amended the rule to allow individuals with final removal orders to apply for provisional unlawful presence waivers if they have filed an application seeking consent to reapply for admission and such an application has been conditionally approved by the USCIS. See 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(iv). Thus, the respondent does not need to have his removal proceedings reopened to apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver with the USCIS. The respondent may request an administrative stay of removal from the DHS while any waiver or provisional waiver applications are pending before the USCIS. 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
David Landry, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondents, natives and citizens of Guatemala, filed a timely appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 2, 2017, decision ordering them removed from the United States to Guatemala. The respondents also filed a motion to remand the proceedings to the Immigration Court to allow the lead respondent (hereinafter “the respondent”)1 an opportunity to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Court.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that prior counsel provided her with ineffective assistance by not seeking asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture on her behalf. The respondent asserts that former counsel did not inform her of the possibility of applying for these forms of relief although she told him she was afraid to return to Guatemala, and he misrepresented to the Immigration Judge that they had discussed the possibility of such relief (Tr. at 20, 25-26). The respondent’s motion is accompanied by a completed Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal; a State Bar of California Attorney Complaint Form, a copy of which was mailed to the respondent’s former counsel; and declarations from the respondent, the respondent’s husband, and the Spanish/English translator employed by current counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 537 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
The Board has limited ability to engage in fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). The determination whether the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel and, if so, whether she was prejudiced involves findings of fact. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004) (stating that alien must show prejudice in order to prevail on ineffective assistance of counsel claim). Therefore, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge to address the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

File: AXXX XX5 937 - Harlingen, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Divyesh R. Gopal, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christine H. Kim
Law Clerk
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On April 7, 2017, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind a January 10, 2003, in absentia order of removal. The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, now appeals. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings regarding witness credibility and what is likely to happen to the respondent, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review all other issues, including questions of law, discretion, and judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
In general, an alien may file one motion to reopen, and any such motion must be filed within 90 days of the entry of the final administrative order of removal. Section 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) (2012); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). The Act and regulations provide an exception to the general rule in the case of an alien who seeks to rescind an in absentia order of removal. An in absentia order of removal may be rescinded only by a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances, or a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that she did not receive notice in accordance with section 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act. See section 240(c)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
The Board and the Immigration Courts also have reopened cases filed more than 90 days after a final administrative order in which an alien proves that his claim was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel and when the motion was filed within a reasonable time after discovering the ineffective assistance. Our review of allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel is governed by our analysis in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion because the respondent did not demonstrate that she did not receive notice of her January 10, 2003, hearing. The record reflects that the Notice to Appear, which was personally served on the respondent on August 13, 2002, indicated that the respondent’s next hearing was scheduled for January 10, 2003, in Harlingen, Texas (IJ at 1). The Certificate of Service bears the respondent’s signature and indicates that she was provided oral notice in Spanish of the consequences of her failure to appear (IJ at 1; Exh. 1).
 
*2 The respondent concedes that the Notice to Appear contained the time, date, and location of the hearing, but contends that she did not understand the consequences of her failure to appear due to the immigration officer’s poor Spanish translation (IJ at 1; Respondent’s Br. at 3, 14-15, 17, 20, 21; Motion at 8). We are not persuaded by this argument. In her supporting affidavit the respondent indicated that she sought the help of Cejas Enterprise, INC, to file a change of address form because she did not understand English (IJ at 2; Motion to Reopen, Tab F). The warning regarding the change of address requirement is in the paragraph entitled “Failure to appear,” which also informs the alien that a removal order may be issued if the alien fails “to attend the hearing at the time and place designated on this notice.” Given that the warnings are in the same paragraph, we are not persuaded that the respondent understood she had to file a change of address form but did not understand the consequences of her failure to appear (Respondent’s Br. at 20). Additionally, the respondent’s argument that she was not informed of the right to a change of venue has no bearing on whether she received notice of her January 10, 2003, hearing (Respondent’s Br. at 3, 16; Motion at 9).
 
We also affirm the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that equitable tolling of the filing deadline was not warranted in the respondent’s case because the respondent did not demonstrate reasonable diligence (IJ at 2; Respondent’s Br. at 22). In Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337 (5th Cir. 2016), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, under whose jurisdiction this case arises, recognized that under its equitable tolling standard “a litigant is entitled to equitable tolling of a statute of limitations only if the litigant establishes two elements: ‘(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.”DD’ Id. at 344. See also Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 649 (2010) (citing Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 418 (2005)). Taking this case law into consideration, we conclude that equitable tolling is not warranted in the respondent’s case because she did not demonstrate that she pursued her rights with “reasonable diligence.” Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d at 344. The respondent acknowledged that she did not seek legal advice until 2012, when she and her husband retained their former counsel to file a motion to reopen and a Form I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative) based on their 2012 marriage (IJ at 2; Respondent’s Br. at 4-5; Motion at 4, Tab F).
 
*3 The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge violated her due process rights because she did not consider the totality of the circumstances when she denied the motion to reopen for lack of exceptional circumstances (IJ at 2; Respondent’s Br. at 21-22, 24-25). The respondent states that her life in the years after her in absentia order of removal was dedicated to taking care of her husband, who had health issues, and her children (Respondent’s Br. at 21; Motion at 14). She also claims that her former counsel’s failure to file a motion to reopen in 2012 amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel and added to her immigration dilemma (Respondent’s Br. at 25).
 
Our review of the record does not reflect that the Immigration Judge violated the respondent’s due process rights. See Bouchikhi v. Holder, 676 F.3d 173, 180 (5th Cir. 2012) (explaining that to prevail on a due process violation claim the respondent must show substantial prejudice); see also Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356 (BIA 1983). The respondent did not explain how her husband’s health issues prevented her from attending her January 10, 2003, hearing.1 Her desire not to be separated from her husband and children does not excuse her failure to appear, and does not amount to an exceptional circumstance (Respondent’s Br. at 7; Motion at 14). Further, to extent the respondent relies on her former counsel’s ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to file a motion to reopen in 2012, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the failure to file a motion in 2012 has no bearing on why the respondent failed to appear at her January 10, 2003, hearing (IJ at 2 n1; Respondent’s Br. at 7, 23, 25; Motion at 13). Finally, as stated previously, a motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal. The respondent filed her motion on March 20, 2017, more than 14 years after the in absentia order of removal (IJ at 2). Considering the totality of the circumstances, we are not persuaded that the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen violated the respondent’s due process rights.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kerry E. Doyle, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on January 25, 2017, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his applications adjustment of status and voluntary departure in the exercise of discretion. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen due to the ineffective assistance of his prior counsel.1 The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent has substantially complied with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Moreover, the respondent has established that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s deficient performance including not calling the respondent to testify and not providing more evidence in support of his applications for relief. Further, the respondent’s sole conviction for operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor and failing to stop for police, while very serious, occurred 9 years ago. In light of the evidence presented, the respondent positive equities, and the non-opposition by the DHS, we will grant the motion and remand the proceedings to provide the respondent a further opportunity to pursue relief. We do not express an opinion on the merits of the respondent’s entitlement to relief. On remand, the Immigration Judge may receive any additional evidence he deems appropriate to the full resolution of this matter. Accordingly, the motion will be granted.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings not inconsistent with this order.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cori White
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Niger, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 20, 2017, which denied her motion to reopen removal proceedings. The parties have provided arguments on appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record shows that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personally served the respondent with a Notice to Appear on August 23, 2013 (Exh. 1). During these proceedings, the respondent was represented by counsel, S. Wayne Patterson. On February 6, 2014, the Immigration Judge granted a period of pre-conclusion voluntary departure until June 6, 2014, with an alternate order of removal.
 
On May 6, 2014, the respondent, through new counsel, Ann Marie Dooley, filed a motion to reopen to terminate her voluntary departure and secure a final order of removal. The Immigration Judge issued an order in response on May 9, 2014.
 
On June 2, 2017, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a motion to reopen in order to pursue an application for for asylum and withholding of removal under sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158, 1231(b)(3) (2012), and protection under the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c). The motion alleged ineffective assistance from attorney Patterson. The Immigration Judge denied the motion in the June 20, 2017, decision on appeal.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. As the Immigration Judge stated, the motion is number-barred, and it is time-barred as well. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent has not shown or alleged changed country conditions in Niger to demonstrate that her motion should be excepted from the time and numerical limitations on motions to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Rather, she contends that the motion is not subject to the time and number limits, or should be granted sua sponte, because of ineffective assistance she received from attorney Patterson. The respondent asserts that the claimed ineffective assistance took two forms: (1) the filing of a deficient application for prosecutorial discretion; and (2) the failure to file an application for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab A at 2, Tab B at 9-10). Respondent’s Br. at 16-17. The respondent’s contentions are not persuasive.
 
*2 Prosecutorial discretion is a matter that is wholly within the jurisdiction of the DHS. Matter of W-Y-U-, 27 I&N Dec. 17, 19 (BIA 2017); Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688, 694 (BIA 2012). Thus, even if the application for prosecutorial discretion were deficient, the Board’s authority to protect a respondent’s due process rights does not extend beyond the scope of our jurisdiction. Matter of Hernandez-Puente, 20 I&N Dec. 335, 339 (BIA 1991).
 
As for an asylum application, the application submitted with the motion is predicated on a fear of her husband’s family in Niger subjecting herself or her daughters to female genital mutilation (FGM) (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab B at Exh. 16). However, the claim as is relates to the children is foreclosed by precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. See Niang v. Gonzales, 492 F.3d 505 (4th Cir. 2007). Thus, any failure to pursue asylum on this basis is not prejudicial to the respondent. See Ilunga v. Holder, 777 F.3d 199, 208 (4th Cir. 2015) (establishing a due process violation requires a showing that the violation caused prejudice such that the result of the proceedings were likely impacted). As for the claim as it relates to the respondent herself, we do not find that the statements provided by the respondent establish that the terms of attorney Patterson’s representation of the respondent clearly included the filing of an asylum application (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab B, Exh. 1 at 15, Exh. 9 at 4). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Finally, we agree with the Immigration Judge that this case does not present exceptional circumstances that warrant reopening sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). The arguments on appeal in this regard, which rely in large part on the claimed ineffective assistance of counsel, do not persuade us to conclude otherwise. Respondent’s Br. at 19-21. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: MARK SEMANA GAVIOLA
File: AXXX XX8 351 - New York, NY
October 24, 2017
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Salvador E. Tuy, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on November 8, 2012, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s December 21, 2010, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The respondent has now filed a motion with the Board to reopen and rescind his in absentia removal order based on the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. The respondent essentially contends that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance by (a) advising the respondent not to attend the hearing on November 8, 2010, based on the anticipated grant of a continuance, and (b) not acknowledging this erroneous advice in subsequent filings (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2, 4, 6, Exh. A). The record before us does not contain a brief in opposition from the Department of Homeland Security. The motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent’s motion to reopen is both time and number barred. With certain exceptions not pertinent here, an alien is entitled to file one motion to reopen (whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge) and the motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative decision. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). This is the respondent’s second motion to reopen and he did not file this motion to reopen until March 30, 2017, well past the 90-day filing deadline.
 
The respondent initially argues that he filed his motion to reopen and rescind in a timely manner given the ineffective assistance of his former counsel, which qualifies as “exceptional circumstances.” (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 1, 7-10). We disagree. Even assuming the alleged ineffective assistance of the respondent’s former counsel qualifies as “exceptional circumstances” under the Act, the respondent’s motion to reopen is still untimely as it was not filed within 180 days of the in absentia order issued by the Immigration Judge on November 8, 2010. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § § 1003.2(c)(3), 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent also has not submitted evidence demonstrating that he did not receive proper notice of the hearing on November 8, 2010, under sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1) or (2); and we are unpersuaded by the respondent’s unsupported contention that the erroneous advice of his former counsel is equivalent to a lack of notice under the Act (see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 9-10).
 
*2 We also conclude that the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen does not qualify for equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of former counsel. In order to warrant equitable tolling of the applicable time limitation based on ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien is required to demonstrate “due diligence” in pursuing his claim during “both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed.” Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 131 (2d Cir. 2008); see also Celtic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006).
 
Here, the respondent has not meaningfully explained how he acted with due diligence prior to retaining current counsel and filing the instant motion to reopen on March 20, 2017. As set out above, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal on December 21, 2010, and the Board subsequently dismissed the appeal from this decision on November 8, 2012. The respondent alleges that he was unaware of his former counsel’s ineffective assistance until 2016, when his former counsel was disbarred and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the Board’s decision dismissing the respondent’s appeal (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 8-9, 11, 16, Exh. A at 2, Exhs. B, H). However, an alien is required to exercise due diligence during the entire period he seeks to equitably toll. Consequently, the respondent does not qualify for equitable tolling because he did not take steps to preserve his rights after the Immigration Judge’s adverse decision in 2010, or even after the Board’s adverse decision in 2012. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F3d at 133 (finding that due diligence required alien to follow up with his attorney after adverse decision); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, (2d Cir. 2000) (finding that alien did not exercise due diligence after adverse Board decision where he attempted to reach his attorney and then did nothing for 2 years).1
 
The respondent also requests that we sua sponte reopen the proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) so he may pursue an application for cancellation of removal. Based on the circumstances presented in this case, we do not find that the respondent has shown “exceptional circumstances” that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte (Motion to Reopen, Exhs. A-N). See Matter of J-J, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to sua sponte reopen proceedings is reserved for “exceptional situations” and “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship.”).2 To the extent the respondent is seeking reopening based on the potential hardship to his family (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 17), we do not have the authority to grant relief from removal solely on equitable or humanitarian grounds. See Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734, 742 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

Aside from the lack of due diligence required for equitable tolling, the respondent has also not substantially complied with the procedural requirements for bringing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim); Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that an “alien who has failed to comply substantially with the Lozada requirements . . . forfeits her ineffective assistance of counsel claim.”). In particular, the respondent has not submitted an affidavit describing in detail the agreement with his former counsel or evidence that he informed his former counsel of the allegations against him and provided him with an opportunity to respond to the allegations. Even though the respondent allegedly attempted to contact his former attorney via phone (Motion to Reopen, Exh. A), the respondent has not explained why he did not attempt to inform his former counsel of the allegations via some other means, like traditional or electronic mail.

Although not dispositive to our decision, we reject the respondent’s contention that his grounds for removal no longer exist because his 1995 California conviction for assault with great bodily injury was set aside and dismissed in 2008 pursuant to section 1203.4 of the California Penal Code (Motion to Reopen at 16, Exh. I). Section 1203.4 of the California Penal Code is a rehabilitative statute that does not remove the immigration consequences of a conviction and sentence. See Matter of De Millan, 26 I&N Dec. 904, 908 (BIA 2017) (stating that section 1203.4 of the California Penal Code is a rehabilitative statute with a number of limitations on relief even under California law, including not affecting the existence of a conviction for the purpose of any subsequent criminal proceedings); Matter of Marroquin-Garcia, 23 I&N Dec. 705, 714-17 (A.G. 2005) (determining that the expungement or vacatur of a judgment pursuant to section 1203.4 of the California Penal Code, a rehabilitative statute, is still deemed a “conviction” for immigration purposes under the Act).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jack E. Wallace, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on March 29, 2017, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reconsider this decision.1 The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
Cast as a motion to reconsider, the respondent’s motion fails to indicate any error in law or fact which would persuade this Board to reconsider our prior decision. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). In his motion, the respondent argues that the Board erred in its assessment of his prior attorney’s admission of alienage, and argues that because his prior attorney made a mistake in admitting alienage, it cannot be considered tactical and the respondent’s resulting removal order is unjust. See Santiago-Rodriguez v. Holder, 657 F.3d 820, 831-32 (9th Cir. 2011). However, we continue to note that the respondent does not allege that his admission of alienage is untrue or otherwise inaccurate, and we find no reason to disturb our previous finding that his assertion of prejudice, under Matter of Lozada, 18 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), is speculative in nature.
 
With his motion, the respondent has submitted a letter from Thomas A. Kroeger, Counsel for the Florida Bar, indicating that “it cannot be said that (prior counsel’s) conduct demonstrated a lack of competence or diligence,” and noting that its standards differ from ineffective assistance of counsel claims in criminal or immigration proceedings. Cast as a timely motion to reopen proceedings, we do not find this letter material to these proceedings or likely to change the result of the respondent’s case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-73 (BIA 1992). As such, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bhavya Chaudhary, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Maribel Mercado
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 26, 2017, denying his motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The respondent has also requested a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed, and the stay request will be denied as moot.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. The respondent has not established that reopening is warranted on account of lack of notice. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The record establishes that the Immigration Court properly mailed the Notice of Hearing (NOH) for the respondent’s March 22, 2012, removal hearing, to his then-attorney of record (NOH dated February 2, 2012). While the respondent’s counsel argues that Attorney Castillo was not the respondent’s attorney, statements by counsel are not evidence and thus are not entitled to any evidentiary weight. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980). The respondent’s counsel’s statements are not supported by a personal affidavit from the respondent indicating the same.
 
Moreover, a review of the record reflects that three attorneys from the same law firm, including Attorney Castillo, submitted Notices of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Immigration Court (Forms EOIR-28), on behalf of the respondent in the proceedings below. Notice sent to an alien’s attorney of record is considered constructive notice to the alien. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c), 1292.5; Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 258 (BIA 1985).
 
To the extent that the respondent argues that his failure to appear was due to ineffective assistance by his former attorney, such claim is untimely as it was not presented within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order, and he has not demonstrated due diligence in pursuing such claim. See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i), 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Further, the respondent has not complied with the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent seeks sua sponte reopening of these proceedings, he has not demonstrated that an exceptional situation exists. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We recognize that the respondent has pending applications before the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). However, a final order of removal does not preclude the respondent from pursuing those applications with the USCIS. The respondent may request an administrative stay of removal from the DHS pending the adjudication of his applications for relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a); see also 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(iv) (amending the rules regarding provisional unlawful presence waivers to permit individuals with final removal orders to apply for provisional unlawful presence waivers in certain instances).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s stay request is denied as moot.
