IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Martin W. Chow, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa M. Putnam
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 On May 4, 2007, the Board affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision, in which the judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings, which were conducted in absentia. The respondent, who is from China, filed a motion to reopen on July 13, 2007. The motion, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), will be granted, and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The motion to reopen presented to the Immigration Court claimed that the respondent did not appear at his July 5, 2006, removal hearing because a former attorney had told him that he had filed a motion seeking to change venue and the respondent did not have to appear at the scheduled hearing in Texas. In affirming the decision of the Immigration denying reopening, the Board considered the respondent’s contention that the attorney told him that he did not need to attend the scheduled hearing. However, the Board determined, the respondent failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. That is, although the respondent had submitted an affidavit with his motion, he failed to submit evidence that he had filed a disciplinary complaint against prior counsel, or informed prior counsel of his allegations.
 
With the motion to reopen, the respondent presents evidence that he has now filed a disciplinary complaint against prior counsel, and has notified prior counsel of his claims. Former counsel responded, and disputes that he told the respondent that he did not need to attend the hearing.
 
Under the circumstances, we find it appropriate to allow the respondent an opportunity for a hearing.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s order of May 4, 2007, is rescinded.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mario Acosta, Jr., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Angela M. Fontova
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was previously before us on July 12, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 28, 2007, which denied his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, filed this motion to reopen and to terminate removal proceedings on October 9, 2007. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that we should reopen and terminate proceedings because the DHS never established his removability by clear and convincing evidence, and that the failure of his attorney, Edgardo Quintanilla, to raise the issue of removability on appeal constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 5-11, Exh. C. With respect to attorney Quintanilla, the motion appears to substantially comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 824-25 (9th Cir. 2003). However, we do not find that the respondent has established the requisite prejudice necessary to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel from attorney Quintanilla to warrant reopening. See Serrano v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 1317, 1319 (9th Cir. 2007).
 
We agree with the respondent that it is the DHS’s burden to establish that an alien is removable. See section 240(c)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(a). However, removability may be established by admission of the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(a). In this case, during the proceedings before the Immigration Judge, the respondent, through his counsel at that time, attorney Daniel Hanlon, admitted all of the factual allegations and conceded removability as charged in the Notice to Appear (Exh. 1; Tr. at 13, 18). Such an admission by the respondent’s attorney, acting in his professional capacity during the respondent’s removal hearing, is binding on the respondent, and he is not permitted to challenge the factual findings or legal conclusions of the Immigration Judge that arose from that admission. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986). See also U.S. v. Davis, 332 F.3d 1163, 1168 (9th Cir. 2003) (factual stipulations may be treated as judicial admissions, which have the effect of withdrawing a fact from issue and dispensing wholly with the need for proof of the fact, and are binding on both the parties and the court). In this motion, the respondent has not demonstrated that, if attorney Quintanilla had raised the issue of removability before us on appeal, the outcome would have been different, i.e., we would have found that the respondent was not bound by his attorney Hanlon’s admissions on the record and that he was not removable. See Munoz v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950, 955 (9th Cir. 2003). Although the respondent states that he did not feel that attorney Hanlon adequately represented him because he did not challenge removability, see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Exh. C, we emphasize that the current motion does not comply at all with Matter of Lozada, supra, with respect to attorney Hanlon.¿FN1º Accordingly, the motion is denied.

In the brief on appeal to this Board, the respondent, through attorney Quintanilla, argued that attorney Hanlon provided ineffective assistance when he failed to present to the Immigration Judge the argument that the respondent’s alcohol and drug use was a disease. See Respondent’s Brief at 6-9. We rejected this argument in our July 12, 2007, decision on appeal, noting that tactical decisions in the preparation and presentation of an alien’s case did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel, and citing Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 934 (9th Cir. 1986).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Chris A. Chouteau, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Olga El Bagdadi
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The respondent appeals the October 5, 2006, decision of the Immigration Judge ordering her removed to Mexico and has filed a motion to remand. The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition to the motion to remand. The motion to remand will be granted.
 
The respondent moves to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel. To warrant such a remand, the respondent must comply with the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and demonstrate that she was prejudiced by her former counsel’s deficient performance. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent has sufficiently complied with the Lozada requirements, including having given her former counsel an opportunity to respond to the allegations and having filed a complaint with the State Bar of California. The respondent argues that her former counsel admitted the factual allegations and conceded removability without the respondent’s knowledge or consent, despite being told by the respondent before the hearing that she had not known that the passengers in her car were not in possession of legal documents to enter or reside in the United States.
 
The respondent submits that her former counsel did not meet in advance with her to prepare for the hearings, did not adequately review and discuss with her the facts of the case, and failed to take into account the respondent’s statement to him minutes before her first hearing that she had not known that the passengers in her car were not in possession of legal documents to enter the United States. The documents in the record support the respondent’s claim that she lacked knowledge that her passengers did not have valid documents (Exhs. 4, 6). By admitting on behalf of the respondent the charge of alien smuggling, the respondent’s former counsel waived the defense of lack of knowledge. This amounts to deficient representation.
 
The Immigration Judge based his finding of removability on the admissions and concessions that the respondent’s former counsel made on her behalf. We therefore conclude that the respondent was prejudiced by her former counsel’s deficient performance. Under these circumstances, we conclude that a new hearing is warranted. We will therefore grant the respondent’s motion to remand.
 
ORDER: The motion to remand is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

IN RE: RAMON ARCADIO GUTIERREZ-CASTILLO
FILE: AXX XX5 617 - BOSTON, MA
November 30, 2007
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert J. Caron, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on August 20, 2001. The respondent, who is from the Dominican Republic, filed the pending motion to reopen on October 3, 2007. The motion is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent was convicted in 1980 in New York of assault in the first degree, and was sentenced to incarceration for 6-18 years. The respondent spent 11 years in prison as a result of this conviction (Tr. at 53). The Immigration Judge concluded that, after passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (“IIRIRA”), the respondent was ineligible for relief under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), and the Board affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge.
 
The respondent claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from Randy Olen, who represented him before the Immigration Judge and on appeal to the Board. The respondent claims that Olen erred in not filing a brief with the Board contending that he should be able to apply for 2120(h) relief. Equitable tolling of the motions deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence. Chen v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 151, 154 (1st Cir. 2005); Jobe v. 1NS, 238 F.3d 96, 98-99 (1st Cir. 2001). The Board notes that the appeal was filed on December 12, 1996, and according to their affidavits neither the respondent nor Olen made any effort to check the status of the appeal until August, 2007, almost 11 years later. However, the Board also acknowledges that its August 20, 2001, decision was sent to an incorrect address for Olen.
 
Even tolling the motions deadline in this case, the motion is denied for failure to show prejudice resulting from the alleged failures of prior counsel. Zeru v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 59, 72 (1st Cir. 2007); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent contends that he should have been able to seek relief under section 212(h) of the Act, notwithstanding the passage of IIRIRA, as he was eligible for such relief at the time deportation proceedings were instituted in 1994, and proceedings were delayed while the now-DHS considered an I-130 visa petition filed on his behalf. However, the respondent is statutorily precluded from a section 212(h) waiver of inadmissibility as an alien who has been admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident who has been convicted of an aggravated felony. See Matter of Yeung, 21 I&N Dec. 610 (BIA 1996) (finding that IIRIRA’s amendments to section 212(h) relief, which make a lawful permanent resident alien convicted of an aggravated felony ineligible for a waiver, are retroactive); see also Alvarez-Barajas v. Gonzales, 418 F.3d 1050, 1054-55 (9th Cir. 2005); Guaylupo-Moya v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 121 (2d Cir. 2005).
 
*2 The respondent urges the Board to reopen proceedings under its sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). This action is taken only in “exceptional situations.” Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373 (A.G. 2002); Zhang v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 51, 53 (1st Cir. 2006)(acknowledging Board’s authority to reopen sua sponte is beyond court’s jurisdiction to review). As the respondent is ineligible for the relief requested, the Board declines to reopen proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
The pending motion is, therefore, denied, and the request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

IN RE: RONALD ERIC DELHAYE
FILE: AXX XX7 240 - FLORENCE, AZ
November 30, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Run A. Kamran, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Maria N. Bjornerud
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before this Board on July 27, 2007, when we sustained the appeal of the DHS from the Immigration Judge’s grant of a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(c), in the exercise of discretion, denied the application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act in the exercise of discretion, and vacated the grant of section 212(c) relief by the Immigration Judge. The respondent, through new counsel, has now filed a motion to reopen alleging that his former counsel, who represented him before the Immigration Judge, was ineffective in his representation because he failed to adequately prepare and present the respondent’s case. The contention of present counsel that former counsel was ineffective is wholly without factual or legal merit.
 
The instant motion does comply with the requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth by this Board in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). However, the instant motion does not establish that his former counsel was ineffective in representing him at his hearing before the Immigration Judge. Respondent’s present counsel asserts that respondent’s former counsel was ineffective because he did not present the testimony of available witnesses, because he did not present the testimony of an expert witness, and because he did not object to questioning by the Immigration Judge which present counsel argues concerned immaterial matters.
 
The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“DHS”), correctly notes in opposition to the respondent’s motion, that former counsel presented affidavits executed by the available witnesses and informed the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s spouse would testify to facts consistent with her affidavit. The DHS also notes that respondent’s former counsel did submit a recommendation letter from a clinical psychologist in support of the respondent’s claims of rehabilitation. Finally, the DHS also correctly asserts that the questioning of the respondent by the Immigration Judge concerning the respondent’s sexual practices is relevant to a determination of whether a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted where concerns in the case arise due to the respondent’s sexual abuse of a child.
 
Ineffective assistance of counsel in a removal proceedings is a denial of due process if the proceeding was so fundamentally tmfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case. See Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1985). In any case presenting an ineffectiveness claim, the performance inquiry must be whether counsel’s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984). Methods of case presentation are within counsel’s professional judgment and are afforded great deference. See Strickland v. Washington, supra at 688-89. Strategic decisions, such as whether to call a particular witness at the hearing, rest upon the sound professional judgment of the lawyer.  Gustave v. United States, 627 F.2d 901, 904 (9th Cir. 1980). Such appropriately informed strategic decisions are virtually unchallengeable. See Strickland v. Washington, supra at 690.
 
*2 The assertion by respondent’s present counsel that presenting witnesses likely would have altered the outcome of the instant case is not fact but opinion. On the contrary, the presentation of witness testimony also carries with it the right of cross-examination which may result in the identification of additional adverse information or reason to discount the favorable information in a statement or affidavit that would otherwise go unchallenged. The decision in this matter to rely upon certain written statements and affidavits rather than presenting testimony subject to cross-examination is precisely the kind of informed strategic decision that rests upon the sound professional judgment of an attorney. Similarly, respondent’s former counsel had nothing to gain on behalf of the respondent by objecting to questioning by the Immigration Judge that the Immigration Judge found relevant to whether he was going to grant section 212(c) relief in the exercise of his discretion. Indeed, while information was elicited by the Immigration Judge’s questioning which concerned this Board, the Immigration Judge determined by his questioning that, in his opinion, the respondent was deserving of a favorable exercise of discretion.
 
The judgments of former counsel criticized by present counsel are the kind of strategic decisions that are virtually unchallengeable. In this matter, former counsel’s strategic decisions in the presentation of the respondent’s case initially resulted in a favorable determination. We do not find that those strategic decisions represent an attorney performing below the minimum standards of competence which the respondent had a right to expect. This is not an instance where former counsel failed to meet a deadline or submit an application, nor is this an instance where former counsel did not reasonably prepare for the hearing or present any evidence on the respondent’s behalf. Rather, this is an instance where present counsel is second-guessing former counsel’s method of case presentation and strategic decisions, out of a belief, which may not be accurate, that his own methods would not only have resulted in success before the Immigration Judge but also before this Board. As such, in the absence of “egregious circumstances,” an alien is bound by the “reasonable tactical decisions of his counsel.” See Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938, 942 (BIA 1995), citing Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 383 (BIA 1986); see also Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 933-34 (9th Cir. 1986). The respondent was not prevented from reasonably presenting his case that he was deserving of a favorable exercise of discretion. Accordingly, the instant motion to reopen is denied because the motion does not establish that respondent’s former counsel was ineffective.

IN RE: ALBERTO FERNANDEZ ALVAREZ
FILE: AXX XX7 101 - MIAMI, FL
November 30, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Juan C. Freire, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider the Board’s June 6, 2007, decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed an opposition. The motion will be granted, the appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.
 
A motion to reconsider must specify the errors in the prior Board decision and be supported by pertinent authority. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). In his motion to reconsider, the respondent maintains that the Board erred in failing to address his contention on appeal that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion by denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. We agree that the Board should have addressed that issue. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
Immigration Judges have regulatory authority to set filing deadlines, and if those deadlines are not met the “opportunity to file that application or document shall be deemed waived.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). While Immigration Judges have broad authority under the regulations, 8 C.F.R. § 1240.41, that authority is not without limitation. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (the Board may review de novo the exercise of discretion by an Immigration Judge). The respondent contends that clerical error on the part of his former counsel caused him not to timely file his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (repealed 1996).¿FN1º
 
In this case, we conclude that the Immigration Judge was unnecessarily rigid in his application of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) and abused his discretion by denying the respondent’s timely motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge appears to have failed to take into account all factors relevant to reopening. First, the motion to reopen was filed, including the completed application for relief, well over a month before the scheduled Individual Hearing and indicated a readiness to go forward on that scheduled date. Cf. Matter of Shanu, 23 I&N Dec. 754, 764-65 (BIA 2005) (affirming the Immigration Judge’s pretermission of the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal when it was filed after the deadline set by the Immigration Judge and on the scheduled day of the Individual Hearing, thereby precluding advance review of it by the government and the Immigration Judge), vacated on other grounds, 450 F.3d 578 (4th Cir. 2006). Second, the DHS did not oppose the motion to reopen.¿FN2º There is no asserted prejudice to the DHS or negative effect on the Immigration Court that may have resulted from the late filing. Finally, the respondent’s application for a section 212(c) waiver on its face reveals a substantial likelihood of success. It shows the respondent has very strong positive equities, including the fact that he has been a lawful permanent resident for almost 40 years and that the convictions serving as a basis for removability occurred in 1977. Accordingly, the prejudice to the respondent by denying the late filing was significant. Under these circumstances, we conclude that it was an abuse of discretion for the Immigration Judge to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. See Ungar v. Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 589 (1964) (“a myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay” can amount to an abuse of discretion). Accordingly, the motion to reconsider will be granted. Upon reconsideration, the appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for proceedings consistent with this order.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reconsider is granted, and the Board’s June 6, 2007, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Upon reconsideration, the appeal is sustained and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

While the respondent is still represented by the same law firm, he notes in his motion to reconsider that the law firm terminated the employment of the attorney whose error is at issue. Although it is clear that the respondent was prejudiced by his former counsel’s error, he does not raise ineffective assistance of counsel and has not met the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).

IN RE: EDDY JOHNNY ROMAN
FILE: AXX XX0 891 - NEW YORK, NY
November 21, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stanley H. Wallenstein, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 11 $2(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)º - Controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Termination
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s May 17, 2006, decision ordering the respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, removed from the United States as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation. Section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S,C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) (2000)
 
In a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) filed with the Immigration Court on February 3, 2005, the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) charged the respondent with inadmissibility under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act on the basis of a 1997 conviction for attempted criminal sale of cocaine in violation of sections 110 and 220.39 of the New York Penal Law. (Exh. 1). At a removal hearing conducted on March 30, 2005, the respondent’a attorney admitted all factual allegations contained in the NTA, admitted “the basis for charge of removal,” and requested a continuance to explore whether the respondent was eligible for any form of relief from removal. (Tr. at 8). At a subsequent hearing conducted on May 16, 2006, moreover, the same attorney conceded that the respondent was not in fact eligible for any form of relief. (Tr. at 30-31). Accordingly, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed on the basis of his admissions and concessions. On appeal, the respondent now argues for the first time that his removability was not established by clear and convincing evidence, despite the admissions and concessions of his counsel, because the DHS offered no documentary evidence to prove the existence of his 1997 drug conviction. The argument is meritless.
 
Applicable regulations, which have the force and effect of law as to the Immigration Judges and this Board, provide in pertinent part that “the immigration judge may determine that removability as charged has been established by the admissions of the respondent.” 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c) (2005). Accordingly, the distinct and formal concession of removability, made by the respondent’s attorney acting in his professional capacity during the respondent’s removal hearing, is binding on the respondent as a judicial admission, and he will not now be heard to challenge the factual findings or legal conclusions of the Immigration Judge that arose from that concession. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986); see also Ali v. Reno, 22 F.3d 442, 446 (2d Cir. 1994) (citing Matter of Velasquez, supra, and holding that an alien in deportation proceedings is bound by the admissions of counsel); Oscanyan v. Arms Co., 103 U.S. 261, 263 (1880) (holding that “¿tºhe power of the court to act in the disposition of a trial upon facts conceded by counsel is as plain as its power to act upon the evidence produced”); cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(B) (authorizing summary dismissal of appeals when “¿tºhe only reason for the appeal specified by the party concerned involves a finding of fact or a conclusion of law that was conceded by that party at a prior proceeding”).¿FN1º Furthermore, an attorney’s concession of removability is binding even if the removal proceeding is predicated on criminal convictions. See Matter of Pichardo, 21 I&N Dec. 330, 333 n.2 (BIA 1996) (“had the respondent admired to the Service’s factual allegation or conceded his deportability … it would have been unnecessary for the Service to present a record of conviction or other documents admissible as evidence in proving a criminal conviction”); LeTourneur v. INS, 538 F.2d 1368, 1371 (9th Cir. 1976) (holding alien bound by counsel’s concession of deportability in the crime involving moral turpitude context).
 
*2 In conclusion, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision ordering the respondent removed from the United States on the basis of his attorney’s concession of removability. Because the respondent is removable on the basis of his concession, moreover, we do not address his appellate arguments regarding application of the categorical and modified categorical approaches.
 
The appeal is dismissed.

FILE: AXX XX3 560 - BALTIMORE, MD
November 19, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pro se
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Daniel J. Menes
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)º Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s September 10, 2007, decision denying as number-barred his motion to rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against him on April 15, 1998, and reopen proceedings. The Immigration Judge noted that a prior motion to reopen had been denied by the court on July 31, 2007. The respondent argues on appeal that his prior attorney rendered ineffective assistance, which resulted in the denial of his initial motion to reopen and the failure of the Immigration Judge to consider the merits of his later-filed motion. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) urges affirmance. The motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, we note that the respondent has failed to comply with any of the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).¿FN1º Even assuming that the respondent had complied with Matter of Lozada, supra, and established that his former counsel’s performance was deficient, we find that the respondent has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by counsel’s representation. See Figeroa v. INS, 886 F.2d 76, 78 (48th Cir. 1989) (finding that to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim there must be a showing of prejudice by counsel’s performance). The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s initial motion to reopen because he failed to submit an affidavit to support his contention that he did not receive the Notice to Appear, and did not consider the merits of the respondent’s subsequently-filed motion to reopen because the respondent was number-barred from presenting a successive motion. The record reflects that while the respondent attached an affidavit to his later-filed motion stating that he did not receive the Notice to Appear, he did not address the evidence attached to the response by the DHS reflecting that the Notice to Appear was sent by certified mail to the address that the respondent provided and that the return receipt contains a signature reflecting delivery. In his appeal brief, the respondent argues that the opposition of the DHS to his motion to reopen “was only about court notice slip and P.O. Box address,” and that the Immigration Judge only considered this evidence but did not consider the other evidence in the record regarding the bona fides of his marriage and his request for adjustment of status. However, the respondent was required to establish that he was entitled to rescind the in absentia order of removal and reopen proceedings before the Immigration Judge could consider his request to adjust status.¿FN2º Because the respondent does not address the relevant issues regarding notice of the heating, he has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by his former attorney’s alleged deficient performance.
 
*2 As for the merits of the appeal, the Immigration Judge properly determined that the respondent is entitled to file only one motion to reopen an in absentia order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4). Because the respondent previously filed a motion to reopen that was considered and denied by the Immigration Judge on July 31, 2007, the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s subsequently-filed motion as number barred.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Under Matter of Lozada, supra, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be supported by an affidavit, reflect whether a complaint had been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and include a response to the allegations by former counsel or report counsel’s failure or refusal to respond.

While an alien in certain circumstances may seek to reopen to apply for new relief without rescinding a motion to reopen, the respondent was not seeking new relief, and any request to reopen to apply for adjustment of status would be untimely under 8C.F.R. § 1003.23 Co)(3).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael P. Rummel
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Termination; Remand
 
On February 28, 2005, the Immigration Judge found the respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, removable as charged. This matter was last before us on July 13, 2006, when we granted the respondent’s motion to remand pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), in finding that the evidence submitted revealed a factual question as to whether the respondent smuggled aliens into the United States. The respondent now appeals the Immigration Judge’s November 17, 2006, decision again finding him removable as charge d. The appeal is dismissed.
 
In pertinent part, the regulations provide that the Board may summarily dismiss any appeal in which the only reason for the appeal specified by the party concerned involves a finding of fact or a conclusion of law that was conceded by that party at a prior hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(2)(B). In this case, the respondent indicated through counsel at the November 17, 2006, hearing that he was not objecting to the Form I-213, the essential document through which the Department of Homel and Security (“DHS”) aimed to prove the charge (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 8-12). The Form I-213 reflects that the respondent admitted to borrowing the California birth certificates of his sister- in-law and his cousin’s son in an attempt to smuggle two aliens into the United States from Mexico (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 4-5). The respondent further indicated at the hearing that he would not be presenting any rebuttal evidence, motion to suppress the DHS documentation, or allegations of coercion (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 11-13). Moreover, the respondent does not contest the Form I-213 in his brief, stating “I know what I did was wrong and have learn ¿sicº my lesson.” The respondent also conceded that he is not eligible for any form of relief from removal (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 2-3, 13- 14). Therefore, we find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s decision ordering him removed to Mexico.
 
We further note that the respondent alleges in his brief that his former attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to contest the Form I-213. As an initial matter, remand is not warranted on this basis because the respondent failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, supra. Additionally, the record does not support the respondent’s contention that his former attorney provided ineffective assistance. The espondent’s attorney stated that he reviewed the Form 1-213 with him through a Spanish interpreter and he offered no objections (Tr. at 8-9). The respondent also did not object to the Form I-213 or the representations of his attorney at the hearing, despite the fact that a Spanish interpreter was present. Accordingly, we reject the respondent’s claim that his concession of removability resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 For these reasons, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

FILE: AXX XX1 011 - HARLINGEN, TX
November 14, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ricardo Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mike Ochoa
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)º - Convicted of crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Removability
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s November 22, 2006, decision ordering the respondent removed from the United States as an alien who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within 5 years after admission for which a sentence of 1 year or longer may be imposed. See section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i).
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that the Immigration Judge deprived her of a full and fair hearing when he denied her request for a continuance so that she could pursue post-conviction relief with respect to her January 6, 2006, conviction for the offense of theft, a Class A misdemeanor under Texas law (Exh. 2; Tr. at 4-5). The decision whether to grant a continuance is committed to the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6. Thus, an Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance request will not be overturned on appeal unless the respondent establishes that the denial deprived her of her due process right to a full and fair hearing. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987). As a rule, an Immigration Judge need not hold removal proceedings in abeyance based on the mere possibility that a collateral criminal proceeding could have a future impact on the alien’s immigration status. The respondent had (and has) a valid “conviction” for immigration purposes, and her collateral attack upon that conviction does not operate to negate its validity until it is in fact overturned or materially amended. Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). We have received no indication that the respondent’s conviction has been vacated or otherwise affected by her collateral attack. Therefore, the respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge’s denial of her continuance request has compromised the fairness of her removal proceedings or resulted in prejudice. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). Consequently, we find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request for a continuance.
 
During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent’s counsel filed a motion to re-calendar the briefing schedule. While he noted that the respondent’s prior attorney indicated in her Notice of Appeal that he would not be filing an appellate brief, the respondent’s current counsel requests a copy of the transcript and an opportunity to file a brief in support of her appeal. We note that a copy of the transcript was provided to the respondent’s prior attorney, and the respondent was given until April 12, 2007, to submit a brief to the Board. The respondent had an opportunity to request an extension of the briefing schedule prior to April 12, 2007. However, her request to file an appellate brief was received by the Board more than 2 months after this deadline. We note that there are no allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel in this case. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Under the circumstances, we find it inappropriate to re-calendar the briefing schedule. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed and her motion is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Justin Conlon, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Linda I. Spencer-Walters
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
REISSUED DECISION
 
*1 The Board dismissed an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying reopening on July 14, 2006. On June 1, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen that is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003. 2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “D HS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion. The Board will reopen proceedings under its sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003. 2(a), and reissue the July 14, 2006, decision.
 
The respondent alleges that her former attorney, Jose L. DelCastillo, failed to properly advise her so that she could file a petition for review with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The respondent has met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). More over, in a submission concerning the respondent’s complaint against him, former counsel reveals his lack of knowledge regarding the respondent’s appeal rights, by stating that the respondent could have filed a petition for review with the Second Circuit, as she lived in Connecticut. In fact, this case arises within the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit: “The petition for review shall be filed with the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the Immigration Judge completed the proceedings.” See section 242(b) (2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(2). In this case, the proceedings took place in Phoenix, Arizona, as an Immigration Judge there issued an order of removal in absentia, and then denied motions to reopen this decision.
 
The Board’s July 14, 2006, decision will be reissued and treated as if entered on today’s date. See Firmansjah v. Ashcroft, 347 F.3d 625 (7th Cir. 2003) (Board has authority to reissue decision).
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reissue is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated July 14, 2006, attached hereto, is here by reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.

FILE: AXX XX9 170 - CHICAGO, ILLINOIS
November 8, 2007
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael Conlan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 20, 2007, to deny her motion to reopen an order of deportation entered in absentia on February 27, 1996. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that she was not adequately notified of the hearing. Former section 242B(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(a)(2), provides in pertinent part that in deportation proceedings written notice shall be given in person to the alien (or, if personal service is not practicable, written notice shall be given by certified mail to the alien) of the time and place of proceedings. Former section 242B(c)(1) of the Act states that the written notice shall be considered sufficient if provided at the most recent address provided by the alien. However, no written notice is required if an alien has failed to provide an address pursuant to the requirement set forth in section 242B(a)(1)(F) of the Act. See former section 242B(c)(2) of the Act; Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995).
 
On November 15, 1995, the Immigration Court sent the respondent the hearing notice via certified mail at 15 Hawthorne CT, #3, Aurora, IL 60506. That address is contained on a form EOIR-33 filed by the respondent on June 16, 1995. The respondent states in her declaration that she moved to Minneapolis in September 1995 and did not file a change of address form with the Immigration Court. We therefore find that the notice was proper in these proceedings because it was sent to the respondent’s last known address. The respondent was also not entitled to written notice of her hearing by failing to comply with her address reporting requirements.
 
The respondent further argues that exceptional circumstances prevented her from appearing for her hearing. She indicates that she hired an attorney prior to her hearing who had assured her that he would receive all notices on her behalf and notify her of all required appearances in the Immigration Court. According to the respondent, former counsel did not file a Notice of Appearance in these proceedings resulting in her inability to receive the hearing notice. The respondent indicates that she received a letter from former counsel dated May 16, 2007, that informs her of the order of deportation and asks whether she wanted to seek reopening. The respondent states that she authorized former counsel to do so. She further states that she was later informed by counsel’s office that her case was reopened and closed administratively with the consent of the government. The respondent indicates that she believed that her case had remained closed until she was later arrested and learned that she was subject to an order of deportation. She argues that these proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 A motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days of the order of deportation. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this matter arises, has held that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies to the time limitations for motions to reopen during periods when a respondent is prevented from filing his or her motion because of deception, fraud, or error, provided that the respondent acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error and was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance. See Patel v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 1011 (7th Cir. 2006). Herein, the respondent charges former counsel with providing her with incorrect information regarding her immigration status and has filed a complaint against former counsel with a state bar association. The respondent has not, however, provided any evidence that she advised former counsel that he was accused of ineffective assistance of counsel before the Immigration Court and given an opportunity to respond to the motion to reopen. The declaration from current counsel states that former counsel was notified of the bar complaint to satisfy the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). He does not state that he also informed former counsel of the ineffective assistance of counsel argument raised in these proceedings.
 
In Patel v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 829 (7th Cir. 2007), the Seventh Circuit stressed the importance of notifying an attorney that his competence and integrity has been impugned to allow counsel to present his rendition of the facts. We cannot find that the respondent established that she was the victim of attorney negligence based solely on her personal accounts. It follows that the respondent has not shown that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel and equitable tolling of the period for seeking reopening is inappropriate. The motion to reopen was filed untimely. The Immigration Judge’s decision is also affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew Guadagno, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(D), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(D)º- Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, has timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s August 13, 2007, decision. The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We adopt the procedural history set forth in the Immigration Judge’s August 13, 2007, decision. We briefly note, as set forth in the Immigration Judge’s order, that the respondent was granted voluntary departure on December 23, 2005. More than a year later, on August 7, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. He claimed that his prior counsel failed to advise him to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(b), and a Form I-751 hardship waiver. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent met the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), but failed to establish that the filing deadline for his motion should be equitably tolled. Furthermore, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent failed to submit supporting evidence to show that his children would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship, as required to establish eligibility for cancellation of removal. The respondent now appeals the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen.
 
We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. Inasmuch as the respondent is in deportation proceedings, he is not eligible for cancellation of removal.¿FN1º Furthermore, the record indicates that the respondent filed a Form I-751 waiver, which was denied (Exh. 3). Therefore, the respondent has not shown that his prior attorney provided him ineffective assistance or that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance.
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge failed to inform him of his apparent eligibility for cancellation of removal. We recognize that an Immigration Judge is under an affirmative obligation to inform the respondent of any apparent forms of relief from deportation which may be available to him. See Matter of Cordova, 22 I&N Dec. 966, 970-71 (BIA 1999); Matter of Ulloa, 22 I&N Dec. 725, 726 (BIA 1999). Nonetheless, we note that the respondent did not make this claim in his motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge. Furthermore, we find no due process violation, as alleged by the respondent, because the respondent, who is in deportation proceedings, is not eligible for cancellation of removal.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William J. Baker, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before us on October 7, 2004, when we determined that the respondent’s appeal was untimely filed, dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, and returned the record to the Immigration Judge without further action. 8 C.F.R. §§1003.38(b), (c).
 
On August 9, 2007, the respondent filed the instant motion to reconsider the dismissal of her appeal. See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(6). The respondent seeks reinstatement of her appeal. The respondent’s motion is premised on their argument that their appeal was untimely filed due to their counsel’s ineffectiveness. See generally Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
The respondent’s motion to reconsider filed nearly 3 years after the issuance of our prior order is untimely. See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Act (a motion to reconsider shall be filed within 30 days of the entry of a final administrative order of removal). However, because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether this case warrants equitable tolling of the time limits on motions to reopen. The Ninth Circuit has held that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
We find that equitable tolling is not warranted in this case where the respondent has failed to establish that she exercised due diligence in the 3-year period sought to be tolled. The respondent’s motion is not supported by her own statement or affidavit describing her efforts to determine the status of her appeal. The respondent attached a “verification” to the motion in which she states that she has read and believes the contents of the motion to be true. According to the motion, one week after the hearing, the respondent retained Attorney Rodriguez to file an appeal on her behalf. After three months, she did not hear from him and began calling him. For six months she tried unsuccessfully to contact him at which time she gave up and decided to “wait for the attorney.” See Respondent’s Motion at 2-3. Around April 2007, she spoke with the attorney and was informed by the attorney’s secretary that her case was “impossible.” Id. The respondent does not state when she hired new counsel who informed her that the appeal was dismissed as untimely filed. Id.
 
*2 Given the respondent’s “verification” and accepting the motion as the respondent’s own statement, we find that she was on notice that there was a problem with her appeal three months after she retained Mr. Rodriguez when despite her numerous efforts, she was unable to communicate with him. She said at times “the office would even be closed.” See Respondent’s Motion at 3. It was not until two years later that she actually spoke to Mr. Rodriguez. The respondent simply failed to show that she exercised due diligence during this time. She does not state when she retained new counsel and how long it took her to file the instant motion. Although we need not reach the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because the motion is untimely filed, we add that the respondent has failed to comply with any of the procedural requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). This is not a case where the ineffective assistance of counsel is obvious and undisputed on the face of the record so that we would dispense with these requirements. Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied as time barred.

October 19, 2007
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Arthur Evangelista, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated December 4, 2006, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen her deportation proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The respondent filed a timely appeal from that decision. The appeal is dismissed.
 
The respondent does not contest the fact that she was personally served with an Order to Show Cause on June 9, 1989 (Exh. 1). The respondent also concedes that on August 22, 1989, she and her counsel appeared before an Immigration Judge, and were informed she was scheduled for a hearing on November 2, 1989. This hearing was later rescheduled to March 23, 1990, and notice of the same was sent to respondent’s counsel. In her motion and on appeal the respondent contends that counsel did not inform her of either the rescheduled hearing, or that she was ordered deported in absentia on March 23, 1990. While she contended in her motion to reopen that her prior representative thus afforded her ineffective assistance of counsel, she submitted no evidence in this regard. On appeal the respondent has submitted an affidavit alleging former counsel failed to inform her of her rescheduled hearing and the Immigration Judge’s in absentia decision. She also provided a copy of a letter purportedly sent to counsel in this regard.
 
An Immigration Judge may conduct a hearing in absentia if an alien has been given a reasonable opportunity to be present at a proceeding, and without reasonable cause fails or refuses to attend or remain in attendance. Matter of Nafi, 19 I&N Dec. 430 (BIA 1987); see also Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988). Lack of notice may constitute reasonable cause for missing a hearing. See Matter of Lopez-Barrios, 20 I&N Dec. 203 (BIA 203). Moreover, the Board has held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute “reasonable cause” where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997).
 
Here, the respondent failed to submit any evidence with her motion substantiating her claim that she did not receive notice of her deportation hearing because of former counsel’s ineffective assistance. While she has submitted some evidence in this regard on appeal, the Board ordinarily will not consider evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). Moreover, we do not find that a remand in this regard is warranted. The respondent has submitted two of her own declarations and a copy of a letter purportedly sent from current counsel to her former representative in this regard. However, there is no evidence indicating that Mr. Vega was, in fact, ever served with the letter from present counsel. Moreover, the respondent states she has not complied with the requirement that she submit a complaint with the appropriate bar authorities because she “only recently discovered” she had been ordered deported in absentia and was unaware she could file a complaint, and did not know how to do so (Resp.’s Br. at 8).¿FN2º
 
*2 The respondent has not cited any regulation or precedent citing such lack of knowledge as an excuse for failing to comply with the requirements enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), nor do we otherwise find that any exists. Nor has the respondent explained how the bar complaint requirement has otherwise been “fully served by other means.” See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). The timing of her knowledge of the alleged ineffective assistance is irrelevant to this requirement. The respondent is represented by counsel who should be able to assist her in filing an appropriate complaint, and comply with this central requirement of Matter of Lozada, supra. Given this basic deficiency, we do not find that a remand for further review of this claim is warranted. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2; see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992). Similarly, the aspect of the respondent’s motion requesting reopening to pursue an application for adjustment of status and/or NACARA relief, was untimely because it was not filed by September 30, 1996. See 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(1). We note that the result of this case is not guided by our decision in Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998), which applies to motions to reopen under section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b, not to motions to reopen under section 242(b) of the Act.
 
In sum, we agree that the respondent had proper notice of her March 23, 1990, hearing as the same had been given to her attorney of record. Consequently, the Immigration Judge did not err in declining to reopen the respondent’s deportation proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Maria Bjornerud
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler (withdrawn)
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings; relief from removal
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s July 16, 2007, decision finding her removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal due to her conviction for an aggravated felony as that term is defined in section 101(a)(43)(N) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(N), is dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on April 4, 1990 (Exh. 1). On June 5, 2005, the respondent was convicted in the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, for the offense of transportation of an unlawful alien within the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) and (B)(ii), and was sentenced to 33 months’ imprisonment (Exh. 3). The respondent was placed into the instant proceedings with the issuance of the Notice to Appear on May 29, 2007 (Exh. 1).
 
In his July 16, 2007, decision, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal due to her conviction for an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(N) of the Act (I.J. at 2).¿FN1º On appeal, the respondent contends that she has been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel arguing that her prior attorney failed to zealously object to the Department of Homeland Security’s evidence of her conviction and failed to prepare proper applications for relief, e.g., an application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3). See Respondent’s Brief at 4-5 and 8. On appeal, the respondent claims eligibility for withholding of removal as a member of a “particular social group” comprised of “Mexican women who have been raped and who fear reporting the crime to the Mexican police who will not protect her.” Id. at 12-13. The respondent claims that she was raped by her former fiance. Id. The respondent also asserts that her conviction is not one for an aggravated felony. Id. at 5-7. Finally, the respondent contends that the record should be remanded so that she may apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227b(a). See Respondent’s Brief at 11-13.
 
*2 Despite the respondent’s contentions on appeal, we concur in the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the record of conviction in this case establishes that the respondent has been convicted of an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(N) of the Act. See Matter of Ruiz, 22 I&N Dec. 486 (BIA 1999) (holding that an alien who is convicted of transporting an illegal alien within the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii), was convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(N)of the Act). As a result of her conviction, the respondent is not eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act.¿FN2º
 
Moreover, even if we concluded that the respondent had met the technical requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), we find that she has failed to show that any action by her former counsel in not filing a withholding of removal application prejudiced the outcome of her case. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). In this regard, the respondent has failed to set forth a valid claim for withholding of removal under the Act based upon her claimed membership in a particular social group. See Castro-Perez v. Gonzales, 409 F.3d 1069 (9th Cir. 2005) (finding that a woman, basing her claim on membership in a particular social group, who claimed that she suffered past persecution when she was raped by a man she dated and that the Honduran government would not protect her, failed to show eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal because she could not show that an agent of the government committed the rape or that the government was unable or unwilling to protect her). The evidence the respondent has submitted with her appeal does not establish that the Mexican government would be unable or unwilling to protect her and, thus, does not affect the outcome of her case; therefore, she has failed to establish that a remand is warranted for any reason. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(2007).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

It appears that the respondent may have confused the original charge against her which was withdrawn and the aggravated felony charge. Insofar as the respondent disputes the original charge, we find no reason to address her arguments since the charge was withdrawn.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jorge Guttlein, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
Lodged: Sec. 241(a)(1)(A), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(A)º - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act
  
APPLICATION: waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated June 20, 2006. On that date, we adopted and affirmed an Immigration Judge’s November 2, 2004, decision finding that equitable estoppel did not prevent the government from initiating deportation proceedings against the respondent after he was granted permanent resident status through the Special Agricultural Worker (“SAW”) program. The respondent was granted temporary resident status through that program (under section 210 of the Immigration and Nationality Act) on September 9, 1988 and was convicted on July 25, 1989, of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance. His adjustment to permanent resident status was finalized after the conviction—on September 1, 1990. Because his previous conviction rendered him inadmissible to the United States, the Department of Homeland Security initiated deportation proceedings against the respondent.
 
In support of his July 30, 2007, motion to reopen, the respondent now states that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that his former counsel should have cited to the controlling United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit precedent Lok v. INS, 548 F.2d 37 (2d Cir. 1977) (“Lok I”), in arguing that he was eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Lok v. INS, supra, a case involving a waiver of inadmissibility submitted in conjunction with an application for adjustment of status, stands for the proposition that an alien’s 7 years of lawful unrelinquished domicile need not follow an admission for lawful permanent residence. That is, an alien could accrue “lawful domicile” without being admitted for lawful permanent residence, or prior to such an admission. See Matter of Lok, 16 I&N Dec. 441 (BIA 1978). In that case, both this Board and the Second Circuit later found that Lok’s period of residence prior to his admission as a lawful permanent residence could not count toward the 7 years required under former section 212(c) of the Act because prior to his admission, he was under an order of deportation, awaiting action on a private relief bill pending in the United States Senate. See Lok v. INS, 681 F.2d 107 (2d Cir. 1982) (“Lok II”). The respondent’s former counsel has filed a response to the allegation that she provided ineffective assistance below, and argues that Lok I does not apply to the respondent’s case because his drug-related conviction rendered him inadmissible to the United States, and, accordingly, he was ineligible for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act.
 
*2 The motion is denied as untimely, and because the respondent failed to demonstrate any ineffective assistance of counsel. A motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Although the Second Circuit, under whose jurisdiction this case arises, recognizes equitable tolling of such deadlines in ineffective assistance of counsel cases, the court held that an alien must demonstrate not only that his constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000). Here, the respondent does not explain why some 13 months passed after our last decision before he was able to discover and pursue a remedy for the allegedly ineffective assistance. The respondent appears to suggest that he learned of the basis for the ineffective assistance of counsel claim through the results of a Freedom of Information Act request. Yet, he provides no detail on this contention (except to claim, erroneously, that there is no copy of his 212(c) application in the record of proceedings), and in the end, he does not demonstrate that he pursued any available claims with due diligence. Moreover, the respondent failed to comply with the requirements for alleging ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), in that he failed to lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between him and his former attorney. The affidavit accompanying the motion to reopen does not reveal any details of the representation agreement between the respondent and his former attorney, such as any fee structure, or descriptions or dates of meetings between the two parties.
 
Moreover, we cannot on this record find that any ineffective assistance occurred. The respondent’s former attorney was justified in not relying upon Lok v. INS, supra, because there was no issue below as to the respondent’s accrual of the required 7 years of lawful residence. Rather, at issue below was the respondent’s admissibility, and, therefore, eligibility for the waiver. Below, counsel diligently advanced the argument that the respondent was eligible to apply for such relief. Although we do not agree with his former counsel’s current argument-raised in defense of the ineffective assistance claim-that the respondent’s drug conviction rendered his prior admission through SAW void pursuant to Matter of Koloamatangi, 23 I&N Dec. 548 (BIA 2003), we also do not agree with the respondent that counsel’s failure to cite to Lok I rendered her representation of him ineffective. We therefore find no justification for the late motion to reopen, and we accordingly deny the motion.

IN RE: GLADYS NNENNAYA JORDEN,BENEFICIARY OF A VISA PETITION FILED BY BOBBY HARRIS JORDEN, PETITIONER
FILE: AXX XX5 616 - HOUSTON, TEXAS
October 15, 2007
 
IN VISA PETITION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER:
 
Michael Eheman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Pauline Appelbaum
Associate Regional Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The petitioner has appealed the December 17, 2005, decision by the District Director, denying the visa petition which was submitted by him on behalf of the beneficiary, his spouse. In denying the petition the District Director referenced the Notice of Intent to Deny, which cited discrepancies in interviews between the petitioner and beneficiary. With his appeal, the petitioner submitted a motion to reopen, seeking to have new evidence considered. The motion is denied and the appeal is dismissed.
 
In visa petition proceedings, the petitioner has the burden of establishing eligibility for the benefits sought. See Matter of Brantigan, 11 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 1966). The petitioner must prove the required elements by a preponderance of the evidence. See Matter of Pazandeh, 19 I&N Dec. 884 (BIA 1989). Where the bona fides of a marriage are challenged, the petitioner must present documentary or testimonial evidence to show that it was not entered into for the primary purpose of evading the immigration laws. See Matter of Phillis, 15 I&N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975). However, we note that the failure to produce affirmative evidence of the bona fides of the marriage, by itself, is not sufficient to establish that the marriage is a sham marriage. Compare 8 C.F.R. §§ 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(B), (D) (2007) with 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(ii) (2007).
 
The parties married on July 17, 2003, and the visa petition was filed on October 9, 2003. The Department of Homeland Security Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS), held separate interviews of the petitioner and the beneficiary in November of 2004 to determine the bona fides of the marriage. See Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604 (1953); Matter of Laureano, 19 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 1983); Matter of McKee, 17 I&N Dec. 332 (BIA 1980). Following the interviews, the District Director denied the visa petition, concluding that the petitioner failed to prove the existence of a bona fide marital relationship.
 
During the interviews, there were discrepancies between the testimony of the petitioner and the beneficiary. For example, the petitioner stated he met the beneficiary at his home in April 2004, while the beneficiary stated they met at her aunt’s home in April 2003. The petitioner also reported she had met both of his sisters, while she stated she had not met either. Moreover, the documentation provided by the parties regarding cohabitation was all created within a short time before the interviews although by that time they had been married for more than a year. None of this documentation related to the period encompassing their first year of married life. Although the parties were issued a request for further evidence detailing specific documentation needed to support the petition, they failed to adequately reply to the same. Rather, the petitioner provided only an unsworn and uncorroborated statement from his aunt, a 2001 tax return, and evidence of employment regarding the beneficiary.
 
*2 On appeal, the petitioner filed a motion to reopen, and submitted additional evidence. However, the Board has held that, where a petitioner has been put on notice of a deficiency in the evidence and has been given an opportunity to respond to that deficiency, it will not accept evidence offered for the first time on appeal. Matter of Soriano, 19 I&N Dec. 764 (BIA 1988). As noted, the petitioner failed to adequately respond to the request for further evidence. In the subsequently-issued notice of intent to deny the petitioner was informed of the perceived discrepancies between his answers and those of the beneficiary obtained at the interviews, and was again provided an opportunity to submit further evidence and respond to the same. However, the petitioner offered no response, and thus failed to rebut the noted derogatory evidence. On appeal, the petitioner submitted evidence with his motion in support of the bona fides of his marriage.¿FN1º As noted above, the Board does not accept new evidence on appeal where, as here, the petitioner previously was given an opportunity to submit such evidence. As such, the motion to reopen is denied.
 
The evidence before the District Director supports the denial of the visa petition. No satisfactory explanation for any of the noted discrepancies or evidentiary deficiencies has been provided. As such, we agree with the District Director the parties failed to demonstrate that a bona fide marriage exists. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied, and the appeal is dismissed.
 
The petitioner may, of course, file a new petition on the beneficiary’s behalf that is supported by competent evidence that the beneficiary is entitled to the status sought under the immigration laws.

We recognize that petitioner’s counsel avers the petitioner had, in fact, provided him with documentation responsive to the Notice of Intent to Deny, but that he erroneously failed to file the same. This assertion is in the nature of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, no effort has been made to comply with any of the requirements for such a claim, including the filing of a bar complaint. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10(1st Cir. 1988). In light of this failure, and as we do not accept evidence offered for the first time on appeal, denial of the motion is warranted. For the petitioner’s benefit, we note that the evidence submitted with the motion contains the same deficiencies as that previously offered as it fails to include documentation relating to the first year of their marriage. Nor is any explanation offered for the noted discrepancies in their interviews.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rebecca L. Maxey, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Edward L. Dunlay
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on August 1, 2005, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s May 24, 2004, decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4).
 
On May 11, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen based, inter alia, on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion, which was filed nearly two years after the issuance of a final administrative order, is untimely filed. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
However, because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether this case warrants equitable tolling of the time limits on motions to reopen. The Ninth Circuit has held that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent has substantially complied with the procedural requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The respondent claims that his prior counsel, Mr. Ra Shipps, failed to timely inform him of our August 1, 2005, decision. He first learned of our decision on or about April 17, 2007, and filed the instant motion within one month. We find that the respondent exercised due diligence and that this case warrants equitable tolling. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) states that it does not oppose the respondent’s motion. It notes that if the respondent’s allegations against Mr. Shipps are true, that the respondent acted with due diligence and established that Mr. Shipps prejudiced his case. The respondent subsequently filed a statement from Mr. Shipps who accepted responsibility for failing to inform the respondent of our August 1, 2005, decision. In addition, the respondent has provided evidence that he is the beneficiary of an approved immediate relative visa petition and that he is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1255(a).
 
*2 Based on the foregoing, we find that the respondent has established that his case should be reopened to allow him the opportunity to apply for relief from removal. The appropriate orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard Wynn, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alan S. Rabinowitz
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; termination
 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has appealed a decision from an Immigration Judge rescinding and reopening the respondent’s in absentia deportation proceedings, and subsequently terminating the deportation proceedings. The respondent has filed an opposition to the appeal. The appeal filed by the DHS will be dismissed.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent had a legitimate claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent contends that he was not able to file complaints against the firm Immigration Legal Options because it does not seem to exist anymore. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding that the requirements for making claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are generally reasonable, but need not be rigidly enforced). In addition, we agree that, given the DHS’s continued acceptance of the respondent’s various immigration applications throughout the years, the respondent had no actual or constructive notice of the deportation order entered against him. Moreover, given that the DHS granted the respondent’s application for advance parole, the respondent departed the United States with the express approval of the DHS, and it is reasonable to conclude that the respondent was not aware of the consequences of his departure. Given the totality of the circumstances in this case, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent is not barred by the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) from applying for a motion to reopen, and was eligible for rescission of his in absentia deportation proceedings.
 
Further, we also find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent, having returned to the United States under advance parole, is an arriving alien and no longer subject to deportation proceedings. Therefore, the Immigration Judge properly terminated the respondent’s deportation proceedings, noting that the DHS could properly place the respondent in removal proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The DHS’s appeal is dismissed.

FILE: AXX XX8 773 - LANCASTER, CA
October 4, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patricia Vargas, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
This case was last before the Board on July 27, 2007, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The respondent now moves for reconsideration and reopening pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 (2007). The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion asks the Board to reconsider our conclusion that, on balance, his equities in the United States were insufficient to outweigh his criminal record. Specifically, the respondent argues that the Board erred in referring to his criminal record, which consists of two convictions, as “extensive.” He also suggests that we did not give sufficient weight to his equities in this country, particularly his family ties, which include his lawful permanent resident grandmother, two United States citizen parents, and two United States citizen children.
 
A motion to reconsider must include an allegation of material factual or legal error in the prior decision that is supported by pertinent authority. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). While the respondent’s criminal record may not qualify as “extensive,” it is indeed a serious adverse factor in this case, as it consists of a controlled substance violation as well as a firearms offense (I.J. at 8-9; Exhs. 2, 3). Additionally, we observed in our decision that the respondent failed to demonstrate rehabilitation, as the record reflects that he failed to appear for court-ordered rehabilitation after being convicted in December 2005 of possession of a controlled substance, to wit, cocaine, in violation of section 11350(a) of the California Health and Safety Code (I.J. at 8-9; Exh. 2). Thereafter, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest (I.J. at 14). We further note that during his removal hearing, the respondent failed to take responsibility or demonstrate remorse for his November 2006 conviction under section 12025(a)(1) of the California Penal Code for carrying a concealed firearm within a vehicle (I.J. at 15, 17). In light of these serious adverse factors, we are unable to conclude that we erred in finding that the respondent’s equities, while considerable, were insufficient to outweigh the adverse factors evidencing his undesirability as a permanent resident of the United States. See Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7, 11 (BIA 1998); Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581, 584-85 (BIA 1978). We find, therefore, that the respondent has failed to identify any error of fact or law in our previous decision.
 
*2 The respondent also seeks reopening on the basis of new evidence, including a declaration from the mother of his two children, two Western Union receipts, and a copy of his grandmother’s passport. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). He asserts that, while this evidence could have been obtained prior to his hearing, his former attorney failed to recognize the need to do so; he therefore argues that his case warrants reopening on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has submitted an affidavit concerning the details of his agreement with his former attorney, along with a complaint filed with the State Bar of California, a copy of which was apparently served on the respondent’s former counsel. Thus, the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for motions to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 824-25 (9th Cir. 2003). Nevertheless, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that the outcome of his case was prejudiced by his attorney’s actions or inaction. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Although the Immigration Judge cited the respondent’s failure to document his financial support of his children in his overall discussion of potential hardship to his qualifying relatives, it appears that the more significant consideration was the fact that the respondent had not seen the children, ages 3 and 2, since they relocated to Arkansas with their mother in June 2005 (I.J. at 13-14). Thus, even assuming the respondent was contributing to their upbringing financially, there is still insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that his removal to Honduras would exercise a significant hardship on his young children, given that he has not been a regular presence in their lives for quite some time. Furthermore, while the Immigration Judge criticized the respondent for claiming his lawful permanent resident grandmother as a dependent on his 2002 and 2003 federal income tax returns, when she apparently did not relocate to the United States from Honduras until 2004, we did not consider this to be a significant factor in our prior decision; thus, even if the respondent were able to establish that his grandmother was living with him prior to 2004, it would not affect the outcome of his case. We conclude, therefore, that the respondent has failed to show that he was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel and that he has failed to meet the heavy burden required for reopening. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider and reopen is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
June Beack, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on February 5, 2004, at which time we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s December 20, 2002, decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen her March 7, 1997, in absentia hearing for ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion, which will be denied. A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed within 90 days of the administratively final order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s final order was issued in absentia on March 7, 1997, and the motion to reopen is therefore both number-barred and filed years out of time. Id.
 
The respondent argues that we should reopen proceedings based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel that she received from the attorney who represented her before the Immigration Court. The respondent concedes that she has already filed one motion to reopen based on her allegations, and we note that both the Immigration Judge and this Board found that she has failed to meet the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent now requests, three years subsequent to our last consideration of her ineffective assistance of counsel claim, that we grant her motion to reopen because she has now set forth sufficient evidence in support of her claim. However, equitable tolling of the motions deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf. Chen v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 151, 154 (1st Cir. 2005); Jobe v. INS, 238 F.3d 96, 98-99 (1st Cir. 2001). The respondent does not assert an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against her second attorney, who represented her in her prior motion, and she has otherwise presented an insufficient explanation for her 10 year delay in bringing the current motion. Accordingly, she has failed to demonstrate due diligence sufficient to equitably toll the motions deadline, and the motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Glenn L. Formica, Esquire
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reopen, following our order entered on July 24, 2007.
 
We find the contentions regarding alleged ineffective assistance of counsel to be unavailing. Litigants are generally bound by the conduct of their attorneys absent egregious circumstances. LeBlanc v. INS, 715 F.2d 685 (1st 1983); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Ineffective assistance of counsel is a denial of due process only if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his or her case. Mejia Rodriguez v. INS, 178 F.3d 1139 (11th Cir. 1999); Ramirez-Durazo v. INS, 794 F.2d 491 (9th Cir. 1986).
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be supported by: 1) an affidavit by the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; 2) a showing that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and 3) a showing that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, or if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498 (7th Cir. 2001).
 
On the one hand, the respondent argues that the assistance provided by former counsel Kevin Hoffkins was so egregious as to prejudice his case; on the other hand, it is argued that Mr. Hoffkins’ assistance was not such as to warrant filing a disciplinary complaint. In any event, it is not explained, and it is not evident to us, how the outcome would have been any different had Mr. Hoffkins provided any different assistance. The focus of our order was whether or not the Immigration Judge’s decision not to grant a continuance was valid, and we agreed that the respondent had failed to provide good cause for a continuance. The events related by the respondent in an effort to establish ineffective assistance of counsel do not provide for a different conclusion regarding the basis for the denial of a continuance by the Immigration Judge.
 
However, it is now reported that the respondent’s approved work visa has since become current. As the respondent appears eligible for adust his status, we will remand this case to permit him to pursue such relief.
 
*2 Given the lack of adverse factors in this case, and the non-opposition to the motion, we will grant it and remand the case to afford the respondent the opportunity to pursue his application for adjustment of status.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(l)(D)(i)º - Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before the Board on June 7, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying her application for a waiver of the joint petition filing requirement under section 216(c)(4)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B). The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of her prior counsel. The motion will be denied.
 
In her motion to reopen, the respondent maintains that she was prejudiced by her former attorney’s failure to seek a waiver of the joint petition filing requirement under section 216(c)(4)(A) of the Act, or file an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act, 8U.S.C. § 1229b(b). In addition, she argues that her prior counsel erred in failing to file a brief with the Board in support of her appeal.
 
Although the respondent has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec.637 (BIA 1988), she has failed demonstrate prejudice flowing from the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Mojsilovic v. INS, 156 F3d. 743, 749 (7th Cir. 1998); see also Pop v. INS, 279 F.3d 457, 460-461 (7th Cir. 2002). The respondent’s dissatisfaction with her former counsel’s strategy in pursuing relief is not grounds for reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998). Further, the respondent has offered no evidence in her motion to establish that she would have prevailed if her former attorney had pursued these forms of relief. To the contrary, after questioning the respondent regarding potential forms of relief, the Immigration Judge concluded that she was ineligible for cancellation of removal based on her lack of a qualifying relative (Tr. at 12-17). See section 240A(b)(l)(D) of the Act. Finally, the respondent has failed to establish that the Board might have sustained her appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision had her prior counsel submitted a brief. The record reflects that the Board reviewed the Immigration Judge’s decision and affirmed the results of the decision, deeming it the final agency decision. The respondent’s motion to reopen fails to establish that the further development of the arguments contained in her Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) might have led to a different result in this matter. Based on the forgoing, we conclude that the respondent has not shown prejudice flowing from the alleged errors. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anita Delgado, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM The respondent is a native and citizen of Ecuador who pled guilty to two separate crimes of petit larceny in New York. The respondent hired an attorney who appeared telephonically on several occasions. On July 9, 2007, the Immigration Judge attempted to contact the respondent’s attorney, but was unable to do so (Tr. at 26-27; Letter dated July 20, 2007 from Jay C. Sherman). The Immigration Judge informed the respondent that his attorney was not available and asked the respondent what he wanted to do regarding his removal case. The respondent indicated that he would “rather just sign off for a deportation order.” (Tr. at 27). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was removable as charged, and ordered the respondent removed (Tr. at 28-30). The respondent accepted the Immigration Judge’s order of removal as final and waived his right to an appeal (Tr. at 30-32). See also I.J. Dec. dated July 9, 2007.
 
On August 2, 2007, the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal. He alleges that his due process rights were violated because his former attorney provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel. He contends that the Immigration Judge should have provided him with the opportunity to obtain new counsel, and that he may be eligible for a U visa. The respondent has not substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 a 2 (5th Cir.2001). Further, the respondent has not shown prejudice resulting from former counsel’s ineffectiveness. See Ogbemudia v. INS, 988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir. 1993). The respondent did not ask for a continuance or request the opportunity to obtain new counsel. The respondent asked for an order of deportation and waived his right to an appeal. Further, the respondent does not argue that the order of removal was incorrect and has not demonstrated that he is prima facie eligible for relief from removal.
 
Since the record indicates that the respondent’s waiver was knowing and intelligent, and since the respondent has not demonstrated a basis for accepting the appeal despite the waiver, we lack jurisdiction over the instant appeal. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(G) (summary dismissal of appeal appropriate where appeal is barred based on waiver of right to appeal). See also Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

IN RE: ALEJANDRO NOVOA TORRES
FILE: AXX XX6 855 - NEW YORK, NY
September 21, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jon E. Jessen, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; section 212(c) waiver
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 18, 2005, when we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal based upon his failure to file an appeal brief after stating in his Notice of Appeal that such a brief would be filed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E). On May 25, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance by the attorney who represented him on appeal to the Board. We have nothing in the record to indicate that the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The motion will be granted and the record will be remanded.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), an individual may move to reopen his case but must generally do so within 90 days of the entry of the final order in the underlying proceeding. However, the 90-day filing deadline may be equitably tolled where the motion to reopen is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154 (2d Cir. 2006). In order to prevail on such a motion the movant must show that he exercised “due diligence in pursuing the case during the period ¿heº seeks to toll.” Ali v. Gonzales, 448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir. 2006); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000). A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must also meet the procedural requirements set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Finally, the movant must establish that he suffered prejudice because of his attorney’s actions or failure to act. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638. The documents submitted with the motion to reopen establish that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, and that he has shown he exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period he seeks to toll.
 
Upon review of the record before us we find it significant that the respondent was represented at his hearing by the same attorney who failed to file a timely brief during the appeal before the Board. We also find it significant that the respondent’s only criminal conviction of record occurred almost 15 years ago. Taking these factors into account, along with the lack of opposition by the DHS to the motion to reopen, we find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. While we conclude that the Immigration Judge properly set out the law concerning what factors should be considered and how the factors should be balanced in a section 212(c) waiver determination, we will provide the respondent with another opportunity to present evidence in support of his application. We note that one reason the Immigration Judge denied the section 212(c) waiver application previously was that the testimony and documents in the record showed that the respondent was a productive and contributing resident only during the few years prior to the 2004 hearing and the respondent did not account for other years of his residence in the United States (I.J. at 3). On remand, the respondent will be given an opportunity to account for his other years in the United States prior to the 2004 hearing, as well as for the years that have passed since the hearing. The DHS will also be given the opportunity to submit further evidence relevant to the respondent’s application for relief.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated October 18, 2005, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 28, 2004, is vacated insofar as it denied the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrea J. Ferrara, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rosario S. Shoudy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)º - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s July 19, 2007, denial of his motion to reopen removal proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on March 21, 2007. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argues that the respondent’s appeal should be dismissed, and the Immigration Judge’s decision affirmed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent appeared for an initial master calendar hearing on September 13, 2006. The hearing was rescheduled until March 21, 2007, to allow time for the adjudication of a pending I-130 visa petition (I.J. at 1). The respondent and his counsel failed to appear for the March 21, 2007, hearing. An in absentia order was entered ordering the respondent removed to Niger (I.J. at 2). On May 31, 2007, the respondent’s former counsel filed a motion to reopen, and on June 14, 2007, the Immigration Judge denied the motion (I.J. at 2). A second motion to reopen was filed on June 14, 2007, by respondent’s new attorney, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen finding that the respondent had notice of the hearing, and that he failed to establish that his former attorney’s actions prejudiced his case (I.J. at 3). On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not finding that the ineffective assistance of his former counsel amounted to exceptional circumstances sufficient to rescind the in absentia order. The respondent further argues that the Immigration Judge erred in requiring that the respondent demonstrate his former counsel’s ineffective assistance prejudiced his case. See Respondent’s brief at 4-5.
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(B)(4)(iii); Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
*2 The respondent states on appeal that he did not appear for the March 21, 2007, hearing because his former counsel advised him he did not have to go back to court until his I-130 visa petition was adjudicated. The respondent argues that his former attorney’s misrepresentations amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel and should be considered “exceptional circumstances” for purposes of rescinding the in absentia order. Respondent’s brief at 4. In order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel the respondent must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Lozada, supra, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
Along with the respondent’s motion to reopen which was filed with the Immigration Judge, he also submitted an affidavit detailing the interactions with his former attorney, a letter to his former attorney requesting a response to the respondent’s affidavit, and a written request for investigation of an attorney with the attorney grievance commission for the state of Michigan. Based on this documentation, it appears that the respondent has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in requiring that he further demonstrate his case was prejudiced by his former counsel’s actions in order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. To support his argument the respondent cites to two Board decisions, over a decade old, that hold that in deportation proceedings under section 242B(c)(3) of the Act, prejudice need not be shown to obtain relief from an in absentia order. See Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 603 (BIA 1996); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). Section 242B(c)(3) of the Act was repealed by Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRAIRA). The respondent has not cited to any current legal authority under the applicable section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act to support his argument. Furthermore, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, where this case lies, has held that to establish ineffective assistance of counsel in order to rescind an in absentia order, a claimant must establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. See Denko v. I.N.S., 351 F.3d 717, 723-4 (6th Cir. 2003) citing Taniguchi v. Schultz, 303 F.3d 950, 958 (9th Cir. 2002) (to show ineffective assistance of counsel, a party must demonstrate that the actions of his/her attorney resulted in prejudice to the party). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*3 We agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent has failed to demonstrate he was prejudiced by the actions of his previous counsel. See Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 1984). First, the respondent received actual notice of the March 21, 2007, hearing date in open court on September 13, 2006 (Exh. 2). The Notice of Hearing contained warnings that he could be taken into custody and/or an order may be entered for removal in his absence if he failed to appear at the hearing. The notice was personally served on the respondent and his former attorney. See Denko, supra at 725 (failure to heed prior warnings regarding attendance at hearing and neglect to confirm understanding of attorney’s instruction does not result in fundamental unfairness). Additionally, the respondent has not demonstrated that but for his former attorney’s counsel that he need not attend another hearing until his I-130 petition was adjudicated, he would be entitled to continue residing in the United States. The respondent admitted the charges of removability at the September 13, 2006, hearing. The respondent has not demonstrated that he is the beneficiary of an approved I-130 visa petition so that he is eligible to apply for adjustment of status. Finally, the respondent has not demonstrated that he is eligible or has applied for any other form of relief from removal. See Denko, supra, at 723-25.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent has failed to establish that the in absentia order should be rescinded due to exceptional circumstances. In light of our denial of the respondent’s appeal, we decline to address his further request for stay of removal. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lisa S. Brodyaga, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christina Playton
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) º - Controlled substance violation
Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)º - False claim to United States citizenship
 
  
APPLICATION: Termination; cancellation of removal; remand
 
The respondent has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s written decision dated May 4, 2007. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
A central issue in this case is whether the respondent derived United States citizenship from her mother, who was born in the United States. It is undisputed that the respondent was born in Mexico in 1981. Therefore, she is presumed to be an “alien” within the meaning of section 101(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(3), and must come forward with evidence to demonstrate that she is a United States citizen. Matter of Rodriguez-Tejedor, 23 I&N Dec. 153, 164 (BIA 2001) (citing Matter of Leyva, 16 I&N Dec. 118, 119 (BIA 1977)). The respondent contends that she derived United States citizenship through her mother pursuant to section 309(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1409(c). That provision provides that a child born outside the United States and out of wedlock acquires the “nationality status of the mother, if the mother had the nationality of the United States at the time of ¿the child’sº birth, and if the mother had previously been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year.”
 
The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had provided insufficient evidence of citizenship to rebut the presumption of alienage arising by virtue of her foreign birth. In relevant part, he stated that the respondent’s mother, who was the only witness with direct knowledge of the dispositive facts relating to continuous presence, testified in a vague manner. The Immigration Judge stated that the testimony “lacks specificity in detail as to names, address, and most importantly dates. The Court cannot conclude that Respondent has come any where near the level of establishing by a preponderance of the credible evidence that she acquired U.S. citizenship.” I.J. at 7. The Immigration Judge later stated that he found that the respondent’s mother testified credibly “to the extent that she believed what she stated but she simply has insufficiently detailed, independent, corroborated knowledge to meet Respondent’s burden of proof as to the claim of U.S. citizenship.” I.J. at 8.
 
*2 We conclude that the Immigration Judge’s decision, as presently constituted, does not provide us with a meaningful basis for appellate review. See generally Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We are unable to ascertain the extent to which the testimony of the respondent’s mother was reliable; the Immigration Judge’s statements on page 7 as to vagueness and lack of detail imply an adverse credibility finding, but a positive credibility finding was made on page 8. Further, the Immigration Judge’s decision does not contain findings as to the credibility of a witness who testified at length with regard to whether the respondent’s mother had made inconsistent statements about her continuous physical presence in the United States. Also, the Immigration Judge did not specify what type of corroborative evidence the respondent should have presented, and did not articulate why such evidence was necessary to the burden of proof. Absent these specific findings, we are unable to assess the arguments of the parties on appeal with respect to whether the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the respondent is a United States citizen. Therefore we will remand the record for more complete findings on any disputed issues of fact. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (Board will not engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals).
 
As an independent basis for remanding this record to the Immigration Judge, we agree with the respondent’s arguments regarding ineffective assistance of counsel. In support of a motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel,¿FN1º the respondent has submitted an affidavit setting forth in detail the nature of her problems with the representation by former counsel (see Declaration, dated August 21, 2007). A complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and former counsel was provided an opportunity to respond. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), qff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Former counsel’s response included an explanation that the respondent’s application for relief, which was deemed as abandoned by the Immigration Judge, was not timely filed due to poor communication and a mistake in the attorney’s office. See Respondent’s Exh. C. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded in any level of detail to the assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, because it appears that the respondent has complied with the threshold requirements pursuant to Matter of Lozada, supra, and since the respondent, as the record now stands, appears prima facie eligible for relief, the motion will be granted.
 
Finally, we find no basis to remand to a different Immigration Judge, as requested by the respondent. We have reviewed the several reasons asserted by the respondent in support of such a course of action. These reasons, taken singly or in conjunction, are insufficient to justify remand to another Immigration Judge. Over the course of these lengthy proceedings, the Immigration Judge has conducted the hearings in a generally fair way, and we see no persuasive evidence of bias on the part of the Immigration Judge, such as to require a remand to a different Immigration Judge. See Matter of G-, 20 I&N Dec. 764, 781 (BIA 1993). We note that, to the extent that the respondent complains of testimony that was stricken by the Immigration Judge (see Tr. at 94), the respondent is free to present an affidavit or other proffer of evidence to the Immigration Judge detailing the stricken testimony, and is also free to move that a new evidentiary hearing be allowed.
 
*3 For the foregoing reasons, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN RE: JOSE MAURICIO SALGADO PORTILLO

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrea W. Kelly, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James Edward Manning
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s May 3, 2007, decision. The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s denial of his request for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying him a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act as a matter of discretion. In evaluating whether relief under section 212(h) is warranted, we balance the adverse factors evidencing an alien’s undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented on his behalf. See Matter of Mendez, 21 I&N Dec. 296 (BIA 1996). The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge did not give sufficient weight to his claim of rehabilitation and hardship to his spouse.¿FN1º We agree with the Immigration Judge that even considering the hardship to his wife and four children, it is not in the best interest of the United States for the respondent to remain in this country (I.J. at 9-11). The respondent has an extensive and recent criminal record. For example, in 2000, he was convicted of resisting arrest (Exh. 2B). In 2002, he was convicted of burglary of a vehicle and sentenced to 100 days’ confinement (I.J. at 1; Exh. 2B). In 2003, he was again convicted of burglary of a vehicle and sentenced to 60 days’ imprisonment (I.J. at 2; Exhs. 2B, 9D). He was convicted on three occasions, including once in 2003 and 2005, of driving while intoxicated (Exh. 9D; Tr. at 45-46; I.J. at 5). Based on the foregoing, we find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s discretionary denial of a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act.
 
The respondent also claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The record of proceedings includes a motion to reopen and reconsider filed with the Immigration Court, in which the respondent claims that his prior counsel was ineffective. The Immigration Court lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion because the respondent’s appeal had already been entered with the Board. In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires; (1) an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the claim reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. The motion filed with the Immigration Court contains a grievance form but does not indicate that the respondent’s prior counsel was notified of the allegations. Therefore, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. Furthermore, he has not shown that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s alleged misconduct. See Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent has not shown that the outcome of his case would have been different but for his prior counsel’s alleged misconduct. Based on the foregoing, the respondent has not established a due process violation resulting from his prior counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent also contends that the Immigration Judge erred in not allowing sufficient testimony regarding his rehabilitation. However, the respondent does not cite examples of any instances in which the Immigration Judge prevented him from presenting such testimony. Furthermore, the respondent does not indicate on appeal how he has rehabilitated.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert B. Weir
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony (as defined in section 101(a)(43)(B)) (not sustained)
 
Sec.237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of Controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Ineffective assistance of counsel; cancellation of removal
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s May 21, 2007, decision. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, g U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation. The Immigration Judge, incorporating his November 8, 2004, decision, also denied the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a), as a of discretion, and ordered him removed from the United States. The appeal is dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of facts by an Immigration Judge, including those as to the credibility of testimony, to determine whether the findings are “clearly erroneous.” $ C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i)¿FN1º.The Board may review all questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues on appeal from decisions of the Immigration Judge “de novo.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iii).
 
The record shows that on November 2, 2002, the respondent was convicted in the Criminal Court of New York, New York, for the offense of criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree, in violation of section 221.40 of the New York Penal Code. The respondent’s attorney, at a hearing conducted on May 21,2007, conceded that the respondent was removable for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation. The respondent argues on appeal that the professional negligence of the attorney representing him in Immigration Court deprived him of due process. The respondent avers that the ineffective assistance of counsel was reflected by the counsel’s concession that the respondent was removable (Tr. at 4). Where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is made, the Board has found that certain criteria must be met. Specifically, the claim must be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make, counsel must be informed of the allegations against him and provided an opportunity to respond, and the respondent must indicate whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities.  of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000) (upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra).
 
*2 The United States Court.of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, held in Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994) that an alien seeking to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must show not only that counsel was ineffective, but also that the alien suffered “substantial prejudice” as a result of counsel’s errors. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553,558 (BIA 2003) (finding that the respondent had failed to show the requisite prejudice to warrant consideration of his late appeal on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel). While the respondent argues that, but for his attorney’s neglect, he would have prevailed as evidence of removability was not submitted, the record shows that respondent’s previous counsel in no way prejudiced the respondent.
 
The record, as noted above, reflects that the respondent was convicted in the Criminal Court of New York, New York, for the offense of criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree. Section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act provides that any alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation relating to a controlled substance, other than a single offense involving possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of marihuana, is deportable. We fred that, as the record showed that the respondent’s November 2002 conviction involved the criminal sale of marihuana, this conviction rendered him removable under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i). The fact that there was no showing of either the mount of marihuana or whether the sale was for remuneration is of no consequence as the respondent’s offense does not fall within the personal use exception. Accordingly, he has not identified how the actions ofhls previous counsel resulted in “substantial prejudice” to him, and his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is without merit. Absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made before, during, or even after a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity binds his client as a judicial admission. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). Thus, the respondent is now precluded from contesting the Immigration Judge’s determination that he is removable based on that conviction.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ouyana, and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, further argues that the Immigration Judge erred when he denied the respendent’s application for cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent in this case does not merit, as a matter of discretion, a grant of cancellatiun of removal. In adjudicating an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, the adverse factors evidencing the respondent’s undesirability as a permanent resident must be balanced with the favorable factors and social and humane considerations presented in his behalf to determine whether the grant of cancellation of removal is in the best interests of this country. Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998); Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581 (BIA 1978). Although the respondent established that he had lived in the United States since 1981, as a lawful permanent resident, and has family ties here, we find that his continued criminal history in this country outweighs the favorable factors of record.
 
*3 Among the factors deemed adverse to an alien are the nature and underlying circumstances of the removability ground at issue, the presence of additional significant violations of this country’s immigration laws, the existence of a criminal record and, if so, its nature, recency, and seriousness, and the presence of other evidence indicative of a respundent’s bad character or undesirability as a permanent resident of this country. Favorable considerations include such factors as family ties within the United States, residence of long duration in this country (particularly when the inception of residence occurred while the respondent was of young age), and evidence of hardship to the respondent and family if deportation occurs. Additional favorable factors include service in this country’s Armed Forces, a history of employment, the existence of property or business ties, evidence of value and service to the community, proof of genuine rehabilitation if a criminal record exists, and other evidence attesting to a respondent’s good character (e.g., affidavits from family, friends, and responsible eomrnunity representatives).
 
We conclude that significant negative factors militate against a favorable exercise of discretion in this instance. His lengthy period of criminal activity includes a June 1988 conviction for unlawful possession of marihuana, an August 1989 conviction for criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree, a February 1992 conviction for criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree, a November 2002 conviction for criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree, and a May 2004 conviction for criminal possession of marihuana in the fifth degree (EOIR-42A). We also note that the respondent has testified that he has been smoking marihuana habitually for some 5 to 6 years, and has never voluntarily entered a drug treatment program (Tr. at 32).
 
The respondent has also adduced a number of countervailing equities. The respondent entered the United States in 1981 as a lawful permanent resident, although he has been involved with the criminal justice system for a substantial period of time. The respondent, who has never been married, was briefly employed for periods on 1988, 1996, and 2000 (Tr. at 12-13, 17-18). He has one United States citizen child, age 18, who lives in Miami and who the respondent has had no contact with for some 4 to 5 years (Tr. at 14-15). His mother, brother, and sister live in the United States, and the respondent, who has always lived with his mother, owns no property, and has no money or other assets (Tr. at 26-33). He has not served in the armed forces, and does not appear to have been a person of any particular value to his community at large. His application for relief is not supported by testimony, or affidavits, from family.
 
Turning to the issue of rehabilitation, we consider it to be an important factor in light of the nature of the respondent’s criminal record. The Immigration Judge, after delineating the respondent’s criminal activity, found no evidence of genuine rehabilitation, noting the lack of affidavits from family or friends attesting to the respondent’s good character (2004 LJ.

*4 In balancing the various factors in the respondent’s case, we take note of his favorable equities. However, when we weigh these equities against the adverse factors of his extensive history of criminal conduct, and his substance abuse, and our lack of confidence as to his rehabilitation, we must conclude that a favorable exercise of discretion would not be in the best interest of the United States in tlais instance.

September 14, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Georgia B. Gillett, Esquire¿FN1º
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s May 11, 2007, decision ordering the respondent removed to Trinidad and Tobago. The Notice of Appeal was filed on June 11, 2007. While the appeal has been pending, on August 9, 2007, the respondent’s counsel filed a Motion to Withdraw Appeal. The motion indicated the respondent wants to be removed as soon as possible.
 
However, on August 22, 2007, the respondent filed a note to the court indicating that he never requested his attorney to withdraw his appeal. Included in the note is a copy of a letter to the respondent’s attorney requesting the case be mailed to his mother, and stating the attorney’s services are no longer needed. The letter appears to be dated in July, but the day and year are not clear from the copy. There is also a copy of a June 20, 2007, letter to the attorney from the respondent’s mother indicating that services are no longer required and, inter alia, requesting all documents to be sent to a Mr. Sampson. There is also an August 8, 2007, letter from the attorney to the respondent indicating that, pursuant to his request, the Motion to Withdraw Appeal was filed, and documents related to an application for adjustment of status via the respondent’s wife are being forwarded, as well as other documents and the Board’s appeal briefing schedule and transcript.
 
There is no allegation of, or compliance with the procedures to establish, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, so the documents will be considered in the most logical light. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). It appears that the respondent terminated the services of the attorney by July 2007, at the latest. The appeal brief was due on August 10, 2007. The Motion to Withdraw the appeal was not filed until August 8, 2007 and this motion also indicates the respondent’s entire immigration file was forwarded to the respondent on that date. The August 8, 2007, letter from the attorney forwarding material to the respondent does not indicate, as stated in the motion, that the entire immigration file was forwarded to the respondent; just that certain documents were sent to the respondent. Notwithstanding, the respondent’s letter notifying the Board that he never intended to withdraw his appeal was timely filed, although after the due date for the brief. Given the inconsistencies in these documents, the attorney’s motion to withdraw the appeal will be denied.
 
While the motion filed by the attorney does not indicate that she wishes to withdraw from the case, in light of the respondent’s August 22, 2007, note to the Board and supporting letters, we will construe the motion as such. The motion to withdraw from the case by counsel will be granted.
 
*2 There has been ample time during which the respondent was represented by counsel to file an appeal brief, yet none was filed. No request for an extension has been received. There is no allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. Consequently, we also consider the merits of the appeal.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that he should be allowed to apply for adjustment of status via his wife because he is eligible for a section 212(h) waiver for his criminal offenses. However, the June 16, 2006, drug trafficking conviction is an aggravated felony and a 212(h) waiver is therefore not available. The respondent mentions that he is challenging the conviction in criminal court because he was not informed of the immigration consequences of accepting a plea in that case. However, there is no claim that the motion to vacate has been granted. Consequently, we are still bound by the underlying conviction. See Section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A); Resendez-Alcaraz v. United States Attorney General, 383 F.3d 1262 (11th Cir. 2004); Matter of Punu, 22 I&N Dec. 224 (BIA 1998); cf. Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006) (conviction vacated for failure of the trial court to give the alien defendant the statutorily required advisal of the possible immigration consequences of a guilty plea is no longer a conviction for immigration purposes).
 
Accordingly, the motion to withdraw the appeal is denied. The motion to withdraw as counsel is granted. The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

September 5, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rodel E. Rodis, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reissuance of Board decision
 
*1 This case was initially before us on March 2, 2005, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision which found the respondent removable from the United States. On December 27, 2005, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen that was rejected due to filing defects. On January 19, 2006, the respondent filed a corrected motion to reopen. On February 23, 2006, we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen because it was filed more than 90 days after the Board’s March 2, 2005, final order was entered. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
The respondent subsequently filed a petition for review of our denial of his motion to reopen with the Ninth Circuit. The government filed an unopposed motion to remand, which the Ninth Circuit granted. In its motion, the government requested that the case be remanded so that the Board may be given an opportunity to reevaluate our February 23, 2006, decision, in light of the Ninth Circuit’s recently issued decision in Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding that ineffective assistance of counsel entitled alien to tolling of filing deadline for motion to reopen), and to consider whether tolling of the motion to reopen deadline is appropriate in this case.¿FN1º
 
Upon reconsideration of our February 23, 2006, decision, we find that we must still deny the respondent’s motion to reopen, as it was untimely filed, and he has not shown that he should be exempt from the 90-day deadline for filing such a motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). In the respondent’s motion to reopen, the respondent requested that we reopen his case and reissue our March 2, 2005, decision, so that he may timely file a petition for review with the Ninth Circuit. He claims that his attorney, Ted Laguatan (“Laguatan”), was out of the country when the Board decision was issued, and Laguatan did not inform him of the decision until after the expiration of the deadline for filing a petition for review with the Ninth Circuit.¿FN2º
 
To the extent that the respondent has claimed that reopening and reissuance of his decision is warranted due to Laguatan’s ineffective assistance, the respondent has not attempted to comply with any of the procedural requirements when raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and approved by the Ninth Circuit. See Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582 (9th Cir. 2006). In Ray v. Gonzales, supra, the Ninth Circuit has acknowledged that the procedural requirements in Lozada serve important policy goals of ensuring the legitimacy of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and in developing an adequate factual basis to adjudicate such a claim. The Ninth Circuit further recognized that there are cases when the requirements of Lozada need not be rigidly applied, such as when there is an adequate basis in the record for an ineffective assistance complaint and when the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one. See id. and cases cited therein. In support of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent’s sole submission consisted of an unsworn letter alleging, in general terms, that Laguatan gave him notice of the Board’s decision only after the expiration of the deadline for filing a petition of review with the circuit court. The respondent’s minimal submission in his motion does not satisfy the policy goals underlying the threshold procedural requirements in Lozada. The respondent likewise has not demonstrated that circumstances exist that would justify non-compliance with any of these requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to consider the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim against previous counsel.
 
*2 Because the respondent has not met the procedural requirements in Lozada, we need not consider whether equitable tolling of the 90-day filing deadline is warranted due to ineffective assistance of counsel. However, in light of the language in the government’s motion to remand, we will further address the issue of equitable tolling. Even assuming arguendo that we can consider the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel despite his failure to comply with the Lozada requirements, we have not been provided with a sufficient basis upon which to conclude that equitable tolling should be applied in his case. The respondent has not identified, either in his motion letter or on remand, what period of time he seeks to toll. His letter does not indicate when he was made aware of the Board’s decision, and/or Laguatan’s alleged negligence. The respondent has neither claimed nor demonstrated that he exercised due diligence in filing the present motion to reopen as required to establish eligibility for equitable tolling. See Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d at 589, fn. 5 (finding that alien who acted with diligence in filing his claim after learning of counsel’s ineffectiveness was entitled to equitable tolling of the filing deadlines); see also Valeriano v. Gonzales, 474 F.3d 669 (9th Cir. 2007); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
After reevaluating the respondent’s motion to reopen in light of the Ninth Circuit’s case in Ray v. Gonzalez, supra, and the government’s motion to remand, we are unable to conclude that the respondent has adequately demonstrated that his untimely motion to reopen should be granted. We likewise note that the respondent has not argued nor has he adequately shown that exceptional circumstances warrant the exercise of our limited authority to sua sponte reopen his proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). In view of the foregoing, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

DISSENTING OPINION:
Roger A. Pauley
*1 I respectfully dissent. I would find that the respondent is bound by the concession of his attorney that the battery offense was a crime involving moral turpitude. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N dec. 377, 382-3 (BIA 1986). The fact that, in retrospect, the concession may be shown to have been ill-advised does not mean that the respondent can escape its consequences, particularly in the absence of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).

ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on June 19, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b, as a matter of discretion. In addition, we concluded that the respondent is ineligible for Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) because of her criminal record. See section 244(c)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(c)(2)(B)(i). We also rejected the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim finding that the respondent the had not sufficiently shown patent error or complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Zheng v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005). Finally, we noted that the respondent’s newly offered evidence on appeal was not sufficient to warrant a remand. The respondent has timely filed a motion requesting reopening and reconsideration. The respondent has not identified any error of fact or law in our previous detailed decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b) (2007); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24-I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). Furthermore, the respondent’s motion fails to comply with both the statutory and regulatory requirements for reopening. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent has not submitted or identified additional evidence demonstrating that further hearings are warranted. See Matter of S-V-, 22 I&N Dec. 1306, 1307-1308 (BIA 2000); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied and, as a result, the respondent is ordered removed to El Salvador.¿FN1º

August 29, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mayra Joli, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on October 10, 2006, because he failed to appear for a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on March 30, 2007. Therein, the respondent argued that he did not receive the Notice of Hearing. We note that he was personally served with the Notice to Appear that advised him of the requirement to provide his most updated address with the Immigration Court. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on May 16, 2007. The Immigration Judge noted that the hearing notice was mailed to the address reflected on the Notice to Appear, 11521 NW 10 Street, Pembroke Pines, Florida 33026, and the respondent had provided no evidence to establish that he did not receive the notice. On May 18, 2007, the respondent requested reconsideration before the Immigration Judge. Therein, the respondent indicated that he had filed a complaint against his former counsel, and counsel’s negligence caused his failure to appear for the hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on June 21, 2007, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
A motion to reconsider is a request that the Board or an Immigration Judge reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked. Matter of Ramos, 23 I&N Dec. 336, 338 (BIA 2002) (quoting Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 n.2 (BIA 1991)). A motion to reconsider challenges the original decision and alleges that it is defective in some regard. Matter of Cerna, supra, at 402. A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based on the previous factual record, as opposed to a motion to reopen, which seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. Id. at 403; see also section 240(c)(7)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) and Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that it was correct to deny reconsideration based on the record that existed when the motion to reopen was adjudicated. The Notice of Hearing was mailed to the respondent’s last known address, and the respondent failed to establish in the reconsideration request that the Immigration Judge erred in this determination. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny reopening.
 
We further note that the respondent argued in his motion to reconsider that attorney negligence may have caused his failure to appear. We characterize this argument as a request for reopening based on exceptional circumstances rather than an argument pertaining to lack of notice. A request for rescission of an order of removal based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. Because a request for reopening based on exceptional circumstances was not made within 180 days of the date of the respondent’s order of removal, it is barred from consideration. In addition, we characterize the respondent’s motion to reconsider as a second request for reopening. Under the regulation, an alien may only file one motion to reopen an order of removal entered in absentia. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
*2 We would also deny reopening notwithstanding the above bars. Initially, we note that it is unclear if the respondent notified his prior counsel that he had accused him of ineffective assistance of counsel, and allowed him an opportunity to respond to the motion. Dakane v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005); Gbaya v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 342 F.3d 1219 (11th Cir. 2003) (noting that it is required that an alien establish substantial if not exact compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988)). The respondent indicates that his current attorney advised former counsel of the accusation, but we note no evidence that clearly indicates that such notice was given. Even if the procedural requirements for proving ineffective assistance of counsel were established, we cannot find that counsel was negligent in these proceedings. The respondent states in his declaration that former counsel advised him that he need not appear in court until he received the Notice of Hearing. Such advice appears to be proper. We cannot ascertain from the record any evidence that former counsel suggested that the respondent need not appear for the hearing after he received the notice. The respondent presumably received the Notice of Hearing, and he was under an obligation to appear. His failure to do so has not been shown to be the result of attorney negligence.
 
We further cannot grant the respondent’s motion to reopen that was filed with the Board on August 20, 2007. Therein, the respondent has submitted an order from the criminal court that shows that his motion to vacate his plea on the charge of possession of cannabis was granted on August 6, 2007. It is unclear whether the criminal court did so for substantive or rehabilitative reasons. Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003) (if a court vacates an alien’s conviction for reasons solely related to rehabilitation or immigration hardships, rather than on the basis of a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the conviction is not eliminated for immigration purposes). Even if the respondent’s conviction was vacated for substantive reasons, he remains convicted of attempted burglary of a structure that rendered him removable from the United States under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act. Inasmuch as the respondent is a removable alien, we see no reason to terminate these proceedings or remand the record to determine the reason why the criminal court vacated his possession of cannabis conviction. The motion is denied.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: ALVARO DAVID DELGADILLO
FILE: AXX XX9 548 - DENVER, CO
August 28, 2007
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Laura L. Lichter, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Special motion to reopen to seek 212(c) relief
 
*1 This case was last before us on April 30, 1998, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent ineligible for relief from deportation. On May 14, 2007, the respondent filed the instant “Special Motion to Reopen to Seek 212(c) Relief.” The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not submitted a response to the respondent’s motion. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
As recognized by the respondent, his present motion is untimely, as a special motion to reopen to file for 212(c) relief must have been filed on or before April 26, 2005. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(h). The respondent seeks to overcome the untimeliness of his motion by claiming that the ineffective assistance of prior counsel, L. Ari Weitzhandler (“Weitzhandler”), aggravated by his unavailing consultations with immigration attorneys, Philip Alterman (“Alterman”) and Jeff Joseph (“Joseph”), caused the delay in the filing of his present motion to reopen. We are unable to consider the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as he has not complied with the procedural prerequisites as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA). While the respondent submitted a printout which purports to show that a letter was sent to an “Ari” via e-mail, we do not find that this is sufficient indication that Weitzhandler was properly notified of the allegations leveled against him by the respondent. The respondent, for instance, has not provided any evidence linking the generically-named e-mail to Weitzhandler, or any evidence that Weitzhandler received this e-mail or any notification. Likewise, there is no evidence, apart from counsel’s bare assertion in the motion, that a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Id. We note that statements of counsel regarding whether a bar complaint was filed, and whether former counsel was notified of the allegations, are not evidence (Motion at 4-5). See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980).
 
Moreover, to the extent that the respondent has implied that Alterman’s and Joseph’s conduct prevented him from becoming aware of Weitzhandler’s alleged misfeasance and contributed to the delay in the filing of the present motion to reopen, we note that the respondent has not filed a claim of ineffective assistance against these attorneys pursuant to Matter of Lozada, supra. Absent such a claim, and in the absence of any other evidence that would otherwise corroborate the respondent’s assertions with regard to these meetings, the nature and the substance of his conversations with these attorneys, including what these attorneys may have represented to him that “lulled ¿himº into a sense of security,” we do not find there is a sufficient reliable basis upon which we can conclude that the respondent’s actions following these alleged meetings with these attorneys were reasonable under the circumstances.
 
*2 In addition to his failure to comply with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, we are also unable to find that the respondent has shown that he exercised due diligence as required to warrant equitable tolling of the April 26, 2005, filing deadline of this motion. Although the respondent claimed that he began to be concerned about Weitzhandler’s unavailability as early as September 2004, he did not retain another attorney to take his case until 2007. The respondent claims that he contacted attorney Alterman and told him that Weitzhandler was not returning his phone calls. Despite the respondent’s difficulties in reaching Weitzhandler, Alterman apparently succeeded in contacting Weitzhandler himself. The respondent alleged that Alterman told him, after speaking to Weitzhandler, that “it sounded like the motion was simply pending” and that if the respondent wished that he take his case, the respondent needed to get his file from Weitzhandler. The respondent claimed to have gone to Weitzhandler’s office multiple times, but the office was always locked. In reviewing the respondent’s affidavit, we are left with the question as to why, knowing that Alterman had the means and the ability to reach Weitzhandler, the respondent did not press upon Alterman to contact Weitzhandler in order to obtain his file. It is likewise unclear as to why, although he called Weitzhandler’s office “15-20 times” throughout 2005 without receiving any response, and given Weitzhandler’s alleged behavior in September of 2004, the respondent did not retain the services of another attorney to handle his case in 2005, or after he was informed that Weizhandler was “no longer practicing law” in 2006.
 
As such, because the respondent has neither complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, for claims involving ineffective assistance of counsel, nor has he established that equitable tolling should be applied in his case, we will deny as untimely filed the respondent’s special motion to reopen for 212(c) relief. See Infanzon v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 1359 (10th Cir. 2004). In view of the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL¿FN1º
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patrick A. Metcalf, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1) (B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the January 30, 2006, decision of the Immigration Judge which found that the respondent had abandoned his application for adjustment of status. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872 (BIA 1994) (noting that the adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge in whole or in part is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). We observe that the Immigration Judge informed the respondent, on October 4, 2005, of his obligation to have his fingerprints taken¿FN2º in time for the continuation of his merits hearing on January 30, 2006, and warned him that, if he failed to do so, his application to adjust status would be deemed abandoned. See Tr. at 11. The respondent did not comply with this directive. See Tr. at 16-17; I.J. at 3-4. In this regard, applicable regulations provide that an alien’s failure to comply with an Immigration Judge’s order to provide biometrics and other biographical information constitutes appropriate grounds for abandonment, absent good cause. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.47(c). On appeal, the respondent argues that his inaction was due to the “incompetence” of his prior attorney, who allegedly “failed to take any steps on behalf of his client.” See Respondent’s Brief at 2. To the extent that the respondent is claiming that his failure to comply with the Immigration Judge’s order was due to his having received ineffective assistance from his prior counsel, we note that the respondent has not complied with the requirements set forth by this Board in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to appropriately pursue an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See also Patel v. Gonzales, No. 06-3077, 2007 WL 2255213 (7th Cir. Aug. 8, 2007). We disagree with the respondent’s assertions (see “Brief in Support of Appeal,” at 2, item 7) that he has complied with the Lozada requirements. Specifically, the respondent failed to submit a properly executed affidavit setting forth his agreement with his prior attorney.¿FN3º The respondent failed to demonstrate that he notified his prior attorney of his allegations against that attorney, and that he gave that attorney an opportunity to respond to those allegations.¿FN4º Additionally, although the respondent submitted a photocopy of an online document titled “Request for Investigation of a Lawyer Form,” purportedly obtained from the Illinois Supreme Court’s Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission’s website, there is no evidence in the record that the respondent filed a formal complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Thus, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent abandoned his application to adjust status. Moreover, as pointed out by the Immigration Judge in his decision, citing Sections 212 and 213 ¿Aº of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182, 1183a (see I.J. at 5-6), the respondent also failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the respondent’s petition to remand this case for further proceedings is denied.

Footnotes

On November 29, 2006, the respondent filed with this Board two separate briefs titled “Motion to Reopen” and “Brief in Support of Appeal,” respectively. The “Motion to Reopen,” seemingly seeking to reopen the Immigration Judge’s January 30, 2006, decision, was untimely and not filed with the Immigration Court, as required by regulation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Thus, only the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision finding his adjustment of status application abandoned is properly before this Board.

2

The necessity to obtain the respondent’s fingerprints was further underlined by the fact that it appeared that the respondent had several criminal convictions. See Tr. at 7-10; Exh. 3.

3

Both the respondent’s prior attorney and his new attorney were part of the same law firm. See Tr. at 17.

4

In his brief titled “Motion to Reopen,” the respondent indicates that he mailed a copy of his alleged complaint to his prior attorney’s last known address, but we note that such alleged complaint shows no indication that that action was actually taken.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bradford H. Bernstein, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, appeals the Immigration Judge’s May 31, 2007, decision denying her motion to reopen and rescind a removal order entered in absentia on March 7, 2007.
 
The record reveals that on or about June 22, 2007, while this appeal was pending before the Board, the respondent, an arriving alien, was removed from the United States. Unlike other aliens, the departure of an arriving alien subsequent to the taking of an appeal does not constitute the withdrawal of the appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.4. In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, held in Contreras-Rodriguez v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 462 F.3d 1314 (11th Cir. 2006), that “the order of removal may be rescinded upon motion to re-open filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice.” Id. at 1317. Therefore, in accordance with federal regulations and the Court’s decision in Contreras-Rodriguez, the Board will retain jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen alleging that she did not have notice of the March 7, 2007, hearing wherein she was ordered removed in absentia.
 
On May 18, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order entered on March 7, 2007, based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See section 240(b)(5)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(b)(5). The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion. He determined that the respondent did not comply with the Lozada requirements and failed to establish that she had retained Ms. Dahlia M. French. Accordingly, he concluded that the respondent failed to demonstrate that her failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances.
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s findings. She asserts that she substantially complied with the Lozada requirements. She claims that she retained Ms. French in June 2003, to assist her with these removal proceedings. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to establish the nature and extent of Ms. French’s representation. See Respondent’s Motion, Attachment E (unsigned retainer agreement). Additionally, Ms. French’s failure to advise the respondent of her obligation to inform the Court of her change of address in her 2003 letter is not tantamount to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Respondent’s Motion, Attachment E (June 24, 2003, letter from Ms. French to the respondent).
 
*2 However, the record reveals that the respondent was found inadmissible as charged without any evidence of record to support such a finding. The Immigration Judge’s in absentia removal order states that the “Immigration and Naturalization Service submitted documentary evidence relating to the respondent which established the truth of the factual, allegations contained in the Notice to Appear.” Contrary to the Immigration Judge’s order, there is no documentation in this record to establish the truth of the factual allegations contained in the Notice to Appear (NTA). The record before the Immigration Judge contained only the NTA, the Notice of Hearing (NOH) and a Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien (Form I-213) that does not relate to this respondent.
 
Additionally, the record reflects that the NTA was mailed to the respondent on or about March 31, 2003. The respondent does not deny receiving the NTA which informs her of her address obligations. However, the NTA was not filed with the Immigration Court in Atlanta, Georgia until, January 11, 2007, nearly four years after it was served on the respondent. During those four intervening years, an attempt to file an EOIR-33 Form would be unsuccessful because removal proceedings were not initiated until January 11, 2007. On February 23, 2007, a Notice of Hearing (NOH) was mailed to the respondent - at the address listed on the NTA - notifying her of a March 7, 2007; hearing. The respondent states that she did not receive the NOH. The record of proceeding contains no evidence that the address used was in fact the respondent’s address of record. We find that the 4-year delay in initiating these proceedings is an equitable factor in the respondent’s favor, as she had no ability to file a change of address. Based on the totality of circumstances presented here, the respondent’s appeal will be sustained and the appropriate orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The in absentia removal order entered in this case on March 7, 2007, is rescinded, and the proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alexandre I. Afanassiev, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dean F. Emmons
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; voluntary departure
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on March 26, 2007, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s application for registry, and granted the respondent’s application for voluntary departure pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order below. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen, arguing that he never paid the bond required for voluntary departure pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3), because his former attorney of record had erroneously advised him that it was not necessary if an appeal were timely filed. The respondent has submitted documentation to support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, see Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and the record contains evidence that this Board has suspended respondent’s former counsel from practicing before the Board and the Immigration Courts. Finally, the DHS filed a response to the motion indicating that it is not opposed to reopening and remanding the record for the limited issue of redetermining the respondent’s eligibility for voluntary departure.
 
We note that, pursuant to the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3), if the respondent, in fact, failed to post his bond for voluntary departure within 5 business days of the Immigration Judge’s order, the alternate order of removal to Mexico took effect, and we did not have jurisdiction to reinstate the grant of voluntary departure in our adjudication of the appeal on March 26, 2007. However, the record does not contain any evidence that the respondent did not post the bond. Nevertheless, given the response from the DHS indicating its non-opposition to the pending motion, it appears that the DHS is not questioning this fact. Therefore, given the totality of the circumstances in this case, in particular the DHS’s qualified non-opposition response, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen, and we will remand the record to the Immigration Court with specific instructions to only consider the respondent’s eligibility for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted, and our decision of March 26, 2007, is vacated to the extent that it granted the respondent 60 days of voluntary departure.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

August 21, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nancy C. Acevedo, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)º - Convicted of crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration and Reopening
 
In a decision dated November 15, 2004, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent, a legal permanent resident since January 28, 2000, removed from the United States based on the respondent’s concession of the charge of being convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude and his subsequently filed “Motion to Vacate Master Hearing, Withdraw Intent to Apply for Immigration Relief, and Petition for Removal” (hereinafter “the Motion”) received in November 2004. See section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (hereinafter “Act”). The respondent did not appeal the Immigration Judge’s removal order. The respondent filed motions to reconsider and reopen with the Immigration Judge on April 10, 2007. On May 10, 2007, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motions to reconsider and reopen on the bases that the motions were untimely and that the respondent’s motions were not subject to equitable tolling as he had failed to substantially comply with the requirements to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (ruling that to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim a respondent should submit an affidavit explaining his agreement with former counsel, present evidence that prior counsel has been informed of the allegations and given an opportunity to respond, and show that a complaint was filed with the proper disciplinary authorities or explain why no such complaint was filed.) The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent’s motions to reconsider and reopen are untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent argues that he was the subject of a gross injustice as the Department of Homeland Security (hereinafter “DHS”) failed to meet its burden of presenting clear and convincing evidence that he had committed a crime involving moral turpitude and was removable under the Act. While the respondent concedes that he was convicted in July 2004 under Cal. Penal Code § 245(a)(1) for committing an assault upon his spouse by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury to her, he argues that this conviction did not qualify under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act as a crime of moral turpitude as his initial felony conviction was later reduced in September 2004 to a misdemeanor and he was sentenced to serve only 137 days in a county jail. There is no doubt that the respondent’s knowing use of force to produce great bodily harm on his own spouse is a crime of moral turpitude. See Grageda v. INS, 12 F.3d 919, 921-22 (9th Cir. 1993) (ruling that willful infliction of a traumatic injury to a spouse is a crime involving moral turpitude); Gonzales v. Barber, 207 F.2d 398, 400 (9th Cir. 1953), aff’d on other grounds, 347 U.S. 637 (1954) (holding that a conviction for assault with a deadly weapon under Cal. Penal Code § 245(a)(1) is a crime involving moral turpitude as it evidences a criminal heart and a criminal tendency); Matter of G-R-, 2 I&N Dec. 733 (BIA 1946, A.G. 1947) (ruling that Cal. Penal Code § 245(a)(1) is a crime of moral turpitude as the convicted individual intended to do bodily injury on another person).¿FN1º Cf. Matter of Sanudo, 23 I&N 968, 971 (BIA 2006) (holding that a conviction for domestic battery under Cal. Penal Code § 243(e)(1) did not qualify categorically as a crime involving moral turpitude because a person can be convicted of this offense without using violence, injuring, or even intending to injure the victim.) The fact that the California court characterized this crime as a misdemeanor or that the respondent was actually imprisoned for less than a year is irrelevant, as the section 247(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) only requires that a “sentence of one year or more may be imposed.” (Emphasis added.) The provisions of Cal. Penal Code § 245(a)(1) fully meet the requirements of section 247(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act, as the California statute clearly indicates that a conviction under Cal. Penal Code § 245(a)(1) may include a prison term up to four years. Regardless, the respondent conceded to the charge under section 247(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act listed on his Notice to Appear.
 
*2 In addition, the respondent contends that he has “per se” complied with the Lozada, supra, requirements as there is clear and obvious evidence of ineffective assistance rendered by his counsel Hugo F. Larios, even though he has not filed any formal complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or directly contacted Mr. Larios regarding these allegations. See Granados-Oseguera v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 993, 998 (9th Cir. 2006) (excusing failure to comply with the Lozada, supra, requirements because ineffective assistance of counsel and prejudice were clearly evident in the record.) The appellant claims that Mr. Larios informed him that due to his two felony criminal convictions¿FN2º he was ineligible for any type of relief from removal, submitted the Motion of November 2004 apparently without the respondent’s consent, and thereafter refused to further assist the respondent with his removal proceedings. The respondent claims that Mr. Larios’ actions “completely defeated” him and at his subsequent hearing accepted the Immigration Judge’s removal order without any protest. It is further argued by the respondent that Mr. Larios conceded to the Immigration Court that the respondent had committed aggravated felonies and this was the basis for the Immigration Judge’s removal order.
 
We find that the respondent has substantially mischaracterized the presentations and arguments rendered by Mr. Larios in the Motion. While the Motion quoted a large section of 212(h) of the Act, which included a discussion of aggravated felonies, Mr. Larios never conceded that the respondent had ever been convicted of a felony. There is no mention in the Motion of the respondent’s first conviction for statutory rape and he characterized the respondent’s second conviction under Cal. Penal Code § 245(a)(1) as a misdemeanor. The quoted section of 212(h) was done to inform the Immigration Court that the respondent was ineligible for a waiver of removal as the respondent had not lived continuously in the United States for 7 years after being admitted as a legal permanent resident in January 2000. There is nothing in the respondent’s statements, motion, or brief that touches on why Mr. Larios cited to the respondent’s residence status in the Motion or how this admission amounted to ineffective assistance. See Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000) (rejecting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as the alien failed to show how he was prejudiced by the actions of his counsel.) These inconsistencies and mischaracterizations show that the respondent has failed to establish that he was the victim of clear and obvious ineffective assistance of counsel and reveals the wisdom of our holding in Lozada, supra, requiring that counsel be informed of the alleged infractions and allowed to comment on these claims. See Lozada, supra, at 639 (commenting that where essential information is lacking, it is impossible to evaluate the substance of claims for ineffective assistance of counsel, and that the potential for abuse is apparent when there is no mechanism for allowing former counsel to present their version of events.) Therefore, we find that equitable tolling is not appropriate in this case as the respondent, even considering that he may not have discovered the alleged harm until he had obtained new counsel in early 2005, failed to substantially comply with the Lozada, supra, requirements.
 
*3 Furthermore, the respondent alleges that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion in denying the motions for reconsideration and reopening as there is evidence of a gross miscarriage of justice that resulted in the removal order of November 2004. As discussed above, the respondent’s presentations have significant errors of mischaracterization and omission when compared with the record and he has not established that a gross miscarriage of justice has occurred. Thus, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s exercise of discretion.
 
The respondent has not argued that any of the other recognized exceptions to the time restrictions to motions to reconsider and reopen are applicable to his case, nor does the record reflect that the conditions for such exceptions exist. In addition, we note that DHS has not joined in any motion to reconsider or reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iv). For these reasons, the respondent’s motions will be dismissed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Footnotes

We note that in Carr v. INS, 86 F.3d 949, 951 (9th Cir. 1996), the Ninth Circuit simply stated, without any analysis, that convictions under Cal. Penal Code § 245(a)(2) (assault upon another person with a firearm) were not crimes involving moral turpitude and cited to its prior decision in Komarenko v. INS, 35 F.3d 432 (9th Cir. 1994) as precedent on this matter. However, in Komarenko, supra, the Ninth Circuit briefly noted that where an alien’s conviction under Cal. Penal Code § 245(a)(2) could be a crime of moral turpitude, possession of a firearm will not always be a crime of moral turpitude, nor will crimes of moral turpitude necessarily involve firearms. Id. at 435. The respondent’s case is distinguishable from Carr, supra, and Komarenko, supra, on its facts, since the respondent was convicted under a different subsection of Cal. Penal Code § 245 than the alien in Carr, supra, and Komarenko, supra, and is governed by the on-point decision in Gonzales v. Barber, supra.

The respondent acknowledges that he was previously convicted in 1995 of statutory rape, but maintains that this charge was later reduced to a misdemeanor. He further claims that in a decision of January 28, 2000, an Immigration Judge found this charge was not an aggravated felony or crime involving moral turpitude, that it was a “petty offense,” granted an application for cancellation of removal, and granted the respondent’s status as a legal permanent resident. If Mr. Larios had actually informed the respondent that his second misdemeanor conviction made him ineligible for a petty offense exception, this advice would have been correct. See section 212(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act. Furthermore, the respondent acknowledges that he failed to inform Mr. Larios of his prior conviction for statutory rape until he was confronted with this conviction record at a hearing before the Immigration Judge, actions that could support a defense against an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Azanor v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 1013, 1023 (9th Cir. 2004) (ruling that counsel’s actions did not cause prejudice because alien failed to inform counsel of critical facts.)

IN RE: SAUL RAMIREZ AGUILERA
FILE: AXX XX1 951 - SAN DIEGO, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael P. Rummel
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s September 25, 2006, decision denying as abandoned his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) urges affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge set a filing deadline of July 14, 2006, for the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal (Tr. at 20). The respondent’s former counsel filed a motion to extend the deadline until August 14, 2006, due to “lack of contact with Respondent since May 15, 2006,” which was granted by the Immigration Judge on July 25, 2006. On August 3, 2006, the respondent’s former attorney moved to withdraw as counsel and requested a further extension of the filing deadline, stating that the respondent had “demonstrated an utter refusal to cooperate in any way or take any responsibility for his application and removal defense,” and that due to the respondent’s “total lack of cooperation,” he was unable to effectively represent him. On August 21, 2006, the Immigration Judge granted the motion to withdraw and extended the filing deadline until September 14, 2006. The record reflects that the August 21, 2006, order was mailed to both the respondent and his former counsel. On September 25, 2006, when the respondent failed to file the application for cancellation of removal by the September 14, 2006, deadline, the Immigration Judge issued an order denying the application as abandoned, finding the respondent removable as charged, and ordering the respondent removed to Mexico.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that his former attorney rendered ineffective assistance in failing to file the application by the court-imposed deadline. He asserts that he “properly submitted documentary evidence to his representative to establish prima facie eligibility for Cancellation of Removal,” and that his former counsel should have “perfected the filing of his application.” The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to grant him cancellation of removal, asserting that he proved all the elements for this form of relief.¿FN1º
 
The record reflects that the respondent has failed to comply complied with the evidentiary requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 63 7, 639 (BIA 1988).¿FN2º While the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated that substantial compliance may be appropriate, the respondent in this case has failed to comply with any of the Lozada requirements. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 824-25 (9th Cir. 2003). Regardless of his compliance, we nevertheless find that the respondent has failed to establish that former counsel’s performance was deficient. As noted above, former counsel moved to withdraw alleging that the respondent’s failure to cooperate had prevented him from preparing and filing an application for cancellation of removal. While the respondent states in his brief that he provided all the necessary documentation to his former counsel to enable him to prepare the filing, he failed to submit an affidavit either outlining his contacts with counsel or specifying the documentation submitted, and he failed to attach any documentation to his brief or to submit the cancellation application. Based on this record, we find that the respondent has failed to establish that his former counsel rendered ineffective assistance.
 
*2 Even assuming that the performance of his former attorney was deficient, we also find that the respondent has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by counsel’s representation. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 859 (9th Cir. 2004) (an alien may prevail on a claim for ineffective assistance if he establishes that counsel’s deficient performance “may have affected the proceedings”); Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999) (finding that prejudice must be shown for a due process challenge and that prejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected outcome); Mohsseni Behbahani v. INS, 796 F.2d 249, 251 (9th Cir. 1986). By failing to submit any affidavit or documentation, or the application for the requested relief, the respondent has failed to establish that his former counsel’s allegedly defective performance affected the outcome of the proceedings. Finally, based on this record, we find no error with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the application for cancellation of removal as abandoned. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Enrique Rosario, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated April 26, 2007, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion for a continuance in order for him to seek a vacateur of his criminal conviction in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The respondent has appealed that decision. We will dismiss the appeal.
 
The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge if good cause is shown. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; see also Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996); Matter of Silva-Rodriguez, 20 I&N Dec. 448 (BIA 1992); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983).
 
The respondent alleges on appeal that he is pursing a motion to withdraw his guilty plea before the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and had requested a motion for a continuance of removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge. However, the respondent has submitted no evidence that any post-conviction relief has been granted. Therefore, the evidence supports a finding that the respondent’s conviction is a final conviction for immigration purposes. Additionally, an Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals cannot entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to examine an alien’s claims regarding his guilt or innocence. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996).
 
The respondent also argues on appeal that, due to ineffective assistance of counsel, he did not knowingly enter his guilty plea to one count of false claim of United States citizenship. To the extent that the respondent has attempted to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we find that he has failed to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Adedayo O. Idowu, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Nelson A. Vargas-Padilla
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopen
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This matter was last before us on July 9, 2007, when we decided to reconsider sua sponte our previous decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, and to vacate that decision and reinstate the respondent’s prior motion to reopen. The respondent moves the Board to equitably toll the time limitation for filing a motion to reopen and to reopen proceedings based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of prior counsel, Mr. Gayton J. Thomas, Jr. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion.
 
The respondent does not challenge that at a removal hearing on January 26, 2005, an Immigration Judge gave him until February 25, 2005, to file his application for adjustment of status (Form I-485) under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255, based on his marriage to a United States citizen.¿FN1º At the time, the respondent was represented by Mr. Thomas. The application was not filed by the deadline, which led to the Immigration Judge determining that the respondent had abandoned his request for relief, and eventually facing removal from the United States.
 
We find that the respondent’s affidavit, and copies of correspondence to Mr. Thomas and the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland with proof of delivery and receipt provided with the motion substantially comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741, 746 (4th Cir. 2006). However, after taking into consideration the respondent’s arguments in his motion, and the supporting documents, in conjunction with the documents already made a part of the record, we find that the respondent has not established that his failure to file his adjustment of status application by the ordered deadline was due to ineffective assistance by Mr. Thomas. In a motion to reopen filed with the Immigration Judge, Mr. Thomas stated that the respondent’s adjustment application was not timely filed due to the respondent’s lack of funds. This allegation is denied in the motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel filed with the Board, but we find insufficient evidence to support the respondent’s contention in his motion. The respondent indicated in his affidavit that he paid a total of $2,400 to Mr. Thomas, but he does not state when the money was paid or for what purpose. Also, we note that the respondent’s affidavit does not set forth in detail what contact, if any, the respondent had with Mr. Thomas during the time between January 26, 2005, and February 25, 2005. Therefore, we find insufficient evidence in the record from which we can reasonably conclude that the adjustment application was not timely filed for reasons other than the respondent’s own conduct. Given that we do not find ineffective assistance with regard to the filing of the adjustment application, we need not address the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance and prejudice resulting from Mr. Thomas’ subsequent actions.
 
*2 Further, as we find that the respondent has not demonstrated a valid claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, we find it unnecessary to address whether equitable tolling of the time limits for motions to reopen would be recognized in this instance. Accordingly, the motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s stay request is denied.

August 14, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Linda Osberg-Braun, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening; remand
 
This matter was last before the Board on March 19, 2007. At that time, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s November 15, 2005, decision denying the respondent’s request for a continuance. The respondent thereafter filed a timely motion to reconsider, reopen, and remand the matter. The motion will be denied.
 
Although the respondent previously stated on appeal that the Immigration Judge “never gave him the opportunity to request Cancellation of Removal” (Respondent’s Appellate Br. at 3) — a contention that we rejected on appeal as the respondent never requested such relief before the Immigration Judge (Board’s March 19, 2007, decision at 1) — he now concedes that he did not previously request relief in the form of cancellation of removal (Respondent’s Motion at 2). However, he alleges that his attorney’s failure to raise such a claim constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Motion at 2).
 
First, with respect to his motion to reconsider, the respondent fails to specify an error of law or fact in our previous decision. Specifically, we find no new legal argument or an aspect of the case which was overlooked in our prior decision. Second, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that a reopening is warranted here given that he has not shown that the proffered evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). Although the respondent alleges that he is prima facie eligible for cancellation of removal (Respondent’s Motion at 2), he has not shown that such evidence was previously unavailable.
 
Furthermore, considering the respondent’s argument of suffering ineffective assistance by his former attorney, we do not find that the respondent complied with the procedural requirements for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel.¿FN1º
 
Thus, based on the evidence before us, we find that the respondent was not deprived of a meaningful opportunity to be heard given that he was afforded a fair hearing before the Immigration Judge and given ample opportunities to present evidence toward his applications for relief. We therefore see no basis to remand the matter. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992) (stating that we ordinarily will not consider a discretionary grant of a motion to remand unless the moving party presents evidence of such a nature that we are satisfied that the new evidence would likely change the outcome of the case). To the extent that the respondent insinuates that his failure to seek cancellation of removal was a result of the Immigration Judge’s mishandling of the case (Respondent’s Motion at 2-3), we note that the respondent has the burden in these proceedings to demonstrate eligibility for relief. Finally, we find that the circumstances presented in the respondent’s motion are not “exceptional” as to justify a sua sponte reopening of the matter. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the respondent’s motions will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

We have held that a motion to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). In addition to complying with the procedural requirements, a respondent must also show that “he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance.” See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lorraine L. Griffin
Assistant Chief Counsel

APPLICATION: Relief
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent’s timely appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 2, 2007, finding the respondent removable based on his admissions (Tr. at 9-10) and record of conviction¿FN1º (Exh. 3); and ordering his removal to Jamaica, will be dismissed. The respondent’s request to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is granted under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(c). See Matter of Chicas, 19 I&N Dec. 114 (BIA 1984).
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s appellate contentions that he was denied constitutional due process, first by the Immigration Judge, and secondly, by his former counsel, based on allegations of ineffective assistance in the presentation of his case.
 
Initially, we find no support for the respondent’s claim that he was denied constitutional due process by the Immigration Judge. We have held an alien must demonstrate that he has been prejudiced by a violation of a procedural rule or regulation before his deportation proceeding will be invalidated. Matter of Garcia-Flores, 17 I&N Dec. 325, 329 (BIA 1980). This is consistent with the rule that an alien must have been prejudiced by a procedural defect in his deportation proceeding before he will be found to have suffered a denial of due process. See Ka Fung Chan v. INS, 634 F.2d 248, 258 (5th Cir. 1981). In the matter before us, no such prejudice has been shown. Moreover, the record reflects that the respondent had ample opportunity to prepare for and address the removal charges.
 
The respondent has also raised a claim of denial of due process premised on his allegations of ineffective assistance by his former attorney’s presentation of his case. Where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is made, the Board has found that certain criteria must be met. Specifically, the claim must be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make, counsel must be informed of the allegations against him and provided an opportunity to respond, and the respondent must indicate whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2006) (citing Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-498 (5 th Cir. 2000) (upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada)). We note the respondent here has failed to meet any of the criteria set forth in Lozada, in order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Notwithstanding, even if were to find the respondent had complied with the Lozada requirements, he must also establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his former attorney’s ineffectiveness. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra at 640. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, acknowledging that it “has never squarely held that an alien has ‘a constitutional right to effective counsel in removal proceedings,”’ nevertheless has stated that an “alien’s right to due process is violated when ‘the representation afforded ¿himº was so deficient as to impinge upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing,’ and, as a result, the alien suffered substantial prejudice.” Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605, 609 fn.15 (5th Cir. 2006) (citing Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 fn.2 (5th Cir. 2001) (quoting Paul v. INS, 521 F.2d 194, 198 (5th Cir.1975)) (internal citations omitted)). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, supra at 561. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998); see also Assaad v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir. 2004) (ineffective assistance of counsel may violate an alien’s right to due process under the Fifth Amendment if the “representation afforded ¿the alienº … was so deficient as to impinge upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing.”).
 
The respondent has failed to demonstrate what actions his former attorney should have taken that would have warranted a different result and so as to demonstrate he was “prejudiced.” See e.g.,Dakane v. United States Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005) (Prejudice is shown where counsel’s actions is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s ineffectiveness, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different). The respondent’s contention that his former counsel should have objected to the documentary evidence establishing his 2002 New Jersey drug trafficking conviction (Exh. 3) is specious and unavailing, as there is no argument that he stands convicted of that offense and that it is final for immigration purposes. Moreover, we find no support for the respondent’s appellate argument that his former counsel rendered ineffective assistance when she failed to argue that 2002 New Jersey drug trafficking conviction for which he was sentenced to 20 years in state prison, 54 month of which to be served without parole, was not an aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B). We find there is nothing in the record, nor has the respondent provided any evidence to suggest that his former counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair.
 
*3 Finally, with regard to the respondent’s appellate constitutional challenges, we note that this Board and the Immigration Judges lack the authority to consider constitutional challenges to the statutes and regulations we administer. See Matter of Fede, 20 I&N Dec. 35 (BIA 1989); see also Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734 (BIA 1988); Matter of Valdovinos, 18 I&N Dec. 343 (BIA 1982).
 
The respondent raises no other arguments on appeal which were not addressed by the Immigration Judge or which would cause us to reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision. Based on the record before us, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is subject to removal from the United States based on the respondent’s admissions¿FN2º and the conviction record (Exh. 3) submitted in this case. See section 240(c)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1229a(c)(3)(A). Moreover, the respondent has not shown that he was either statutorily eligible or warranted any relief from removal to which he may have been otherwise entitled.
 
Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: WYNDHAM JAMES
FILE: AXX XX4 988 - BUFFALO, NY
August 6, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Albert Van Lare, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on October 3, 2002, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s June 29, 1999, decision denying his motion to terminate his proceedings. The respondent has now filed an untimely motion to reopen. The motion is denied.
 
Through his motion, the respondent, through new counsel, argues that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel during his proceedings before the Immigration Judge and the Board. In particular, the respondent asserts that his prior counsel failed to notify him of the June 29, 1999, removal order entered against him and told him that his case had been resolved favorably in 1998; filed an appeal with the Board without his authorization; failed to notify him of any court appearances beyond his original appearance in early 1998; and, failed to have any contact with him after 1998. The respondent asserts that he has complied with the Board’s requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Although not specifically raised by the respondent, it appears that the respondent seeks to have the motions deadline equitably tolled under Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000).
 
Under Iavorski v. INS, supra, the Board must first address whether the respondent was denied due process in these proceedings based upon the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. At the outset, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, supra. In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved applicant setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the applicant in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id at 640.
 
Further, the Second Circuit has concluded that a valid ineffective assistance of counsel claim occurs when “counsel’s performance impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing in violation of the fifth amendment due process clause.” See Iavorski v. INS, supra quoting Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d 879, 882 (2d Cir. 1994). Such a deprivation of fundamental fairness is established when “(1) competent counsel would have acted otherwise, and (2) the alien was prejudiced by counsel’s performance.” Esposito v. 1NS, 987 F.2d 108, 111 (2d Cir. 1993). It is only when these conditions are met, that the filing deadline for an untimely motion to reopen proceedings based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be equitably tolled. See id. at 108 (motion to reopen to permit filing of appeal based on claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
*2 In this case, we find that even if the respondent complied Matter of Lozada, supra, he has failed to sustain his burden of proof in establishing his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based upon the evidence contained in the record. In this regard, we note that the respondent notified former counsel of his complaint and provided former counsel with an opportunity to respond. The respondent’s former counsel disputes the respondent’s claims and has provided evidence to support his position. In addition to the documentation submitted by former counsel in response to the respondent’s Lozada claim against him, we find that the independent evidence of record supports former counsel’s position that the respondent has misrepresented the events during his proceedings both before the Board and the Immigration Judge in order to support his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
First, the respondent’s claim that former counsel notified him in 1998 that his case had been resolved favorably is belied by the transcript contained in the record which shows that the respondent, represented by former counsel, was present and testified during his merits hearing on May 24, 1999 (Tr. at 30-37). This evidence also dispels the respondent’s contentions that he was not provided the opportunity to participate in his own proceedings, that he was not notified by former counsel of any court appearances after 1998, and that he had no contact with former counsel after 1998. It is disingenuous at best for the respondent to contend that he was informed of a favorable disposition of his case in 1998 by his attorney, that he was not notified of any court appearances after 1998, that he had no contact with his former counsel after 1998, and that he was unable to participate in his “defense” when the record clearly establishes that the respondent was present, represented by former counsel, and actively participated in the May 24, 1999, merits hearing (Tr. at 30-37). Moreover, the record contains a Notice of Appearance, Form EOIR-27, filed with the Board on July 28, 1999, in conjunction with the respondent’s appeal which has been duly executed by both the respondent and former counsel. This evidence contradicts the respondent’s claim that he was completely unaware that former counsel filed an appeal with the Board on his behalf. Under these circumstances, the respondent has failed to establish that the motions deadline applicable to his current motion should be equitably tolled.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

The respondent filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s January 18, 2007, decision denying her motion to reconsider his November 17, 2006, decision denying her motion to reopen in absentia proceedings. On appeal the respondent, through counsel, cites Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in arguing she should not be penalized for her attorney’s mistake in having her come to his office on the day of his uncle’s funeral even though a motion to waive her presence at Immigration Court on that same day had not been granted. The respondent also cites Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155 (BIA 1999) in claiming the Immigration Judge incorrectly required her to demonstrate “exceptional circumstances” rather than “reasonable cause” for failing to appear at her scheduled hearing (Resp.’s Br. at 4-5). The Department of Homeland Security has not offered any response to the respondent’s appeal.
 
The respondent misstates the holdings in Matter of Cruz-Garcia, supra, and Matter of Mancera, 22 I&N Dec. 79 (BIA 1998), which discussed the timeliness of motions to reopen proceedings conducted in absentia under section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.¿FN1º As the respondent’s proceedings were initiated on March 23, 2006, with the issuance of the Notice to Appear, her proceedings are governed by section 240(b)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), which requires a showing of exceptional circumstances, not “reasonable cause,” for failure to appear. Consequently, the Immigration Judge correctly applied the “exceptional circumstances” standard for the respondent’s failure to appear. We also note that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are not applicable in deportation proceedings. See Matter of Magana, 17 I&N Dec. 111 (BIA 1979). As such, the respondent’s arguments in this regard are unavailing.
 
However, we find it difficult to conceive a set of facts upon which a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was so clearly demonstrated as those which are presented before us.¿FN2º The respondent’s counsel has repeatedly admitted he knew his motion to waive the respondent’s appearance at her master calendar hearing had not yet been acted upon. Nonetheless he still had his client travel to his office rather than the Immigration Court as he had a funeral to attend that day, on the assumption that a favorable decision would be rendered. He predicated this assumption on the actions of another Immigration Judge in another Immigration Court, who allowed such waivers (Motion to Reconsider at 1). Counsel admittedly is new to the practice of immigration law, and essentially presented “common sense” and humanitarian arguments in his motions that had nothing to do with either the law, or Immigration Court practice (Motion to Reopen; Motion to Reconsider, tab A). In essence, he contended that as a close relative’s funeral was being held where his attendance was necessary, the Immigration Judge should have excused his telling his client, the respondent, not to appear in Immigration Court, but instead come to his office for a telephonic hearing, despite the fact that a decision had not been rendered on his motion. Such action, facially, constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 The Immigration Judge correctly cited our decision in Matter of Lozada, supra, in noting the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We find such a claim is implicit in the respondent’s motion. However, as noted, we are hard-pressed to discern a situation in which ineffective assistance was so clearly presented. Rather, by his own account, counsel has repeatedly provided the respondent with inaccurate and/or incomplete assistance, both with regard to her appearance at court, and in the filing of her motion to reopen. Given the highly unusual situation presented, we find that the concerns addressed by the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, are satisfied in the instant situation. Counsel clearly admits his deficient service, has had an opportunity to address the same, his errors occurred in the course of representation he clearly agreed to perform, and the respondent was unquestionably prejudiced as a result of his advice. Id. While the requirement that a bar complaint be filed has not been complied with, we shall refer this case to the EOIR Office of General Counsel for review, thus addressing all of the concerns expressed in Matter of Lozada.
 
In sum, we find the respondent was afforded ineffective assistance of counsel. As such, she has demonstrated exceptional circumstances excusing her failure to appear for her October 10, 2006, hearing. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s October 10, 2006, and November 17, 2006, decisions are vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s October 17, 2006, motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

Section 242(b) applies when service of the notice of hearing is made prior to June 13, 1992. See Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). Here, proceedings were initiated in 2006 (Exh. 1). As such, the cases cited by the respondent are inapplicable to her case.

We assume the same thought came to the Immigration Judge, as he outlined the requirements for such a claim as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), in his denial of the motion to reopen. The fact that counsel chose to ignore this suggestion supports rather than undermines the inference of ineffective assistance of counsel.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mario Acosta, Jr., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joyce Bakke
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of an aggravated felony
 
Lodged: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 251(a)(1)(B)º - Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; Termination; Section 212(c) Waiver
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals an Immigration Judge’s March 1, 2007, decision granting the Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) motion to rescind an order granting the respondent’s September 22, 2006, motion to reopen the instant deportation proceedings. In addition, a motion to reopen filed by the respondent on March 23, 2007, and supplemented by a filing on May 4, 2007, is currently before the Board. The appeal is dismissed and the motion is denied.
 
On January 1, 1998, the Immigration Judge found the respondent deportable under former section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. The respondent was convicted on July 21, 1994, of the offense of transportation/sale of a narcotic substance, to wit: cocaine, in violation of California Health and Safety Code § 11352 (I.J. at 2 (1/13/98)). The Immigration Judge further found that the respondent was ineligible for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), pursuant to Matter of Soriano, 21 I&N Dec. 516, 533 (A.G. 1997). The respondent did not appeal this decision and was physically removed from the United States in 1998 pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
Five years later, on January 24, 2003, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court, arguing that the Immigration Judge: (1) erroneously concluded that his 1994 criminal conviction involved an aggravated felony; (2) failed to inform him of his right to seek a section 212(c) waiver; and (3) led him to believe that it would be futile to file an appeal. The Immigration Judge denied this motion on March 17, 2003, finding that it was untimely, as it was filed well over 90 days after the January 13, 1998, entry of the final administrative order (I.J. at 2 (3/17/03)). The Immigration Judge further found that his prior decision was in accord with the law and facts at the time, and that he properly advised the respondent of his right to appeal (I.J. at 2 (3/17/03)). On November 25, 2003, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of this decision on the merits and further rejected an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which the respondent had raised for the first time in the appeal. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We noted in our decision that the respondent’s motion was also barred because it was filed after his physical departure from the United States under a final order of deportation—an act that brought the deportation proceedings to a close. See Matter of Okoh, 20 I&N Dec. 864, 865 (BIA 1994).
 
*2 On September 22, 2006, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen with the Immigration Court. The respondent noted that after reentering the United States illegally in 2001, he was arrested and indicted for violating 8 U.S.C. § 1326, and sentenced to serve 77 months of imprisonment after the entrance of a conditional guilty plea. On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the respondent argued that the 8 U.S.C. § 1326 charge should be dismissed because the January 13, 1998, deportation order was issued in violation of his due process rights. The counsel for the Government in the criminal appellate proceedings agreed and filed an unopposed motion for remand to the District Court, which the Ninth Circuit granted, asserting that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that the respondent’s 1994 conviction was an aggravated felony without employing the modified categorical approach. See United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, 247 F.3d 905, 909 (9th Cir. 2001). In the second motion to reopen filed with the Immigration Court, the respondent argued that reopening was appropriate under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2, because of material changes in the law and because his deportation order amounted to a deprivation of due process. The Immigration Judge granted this motion on September 28, 2006.
 
However, in a decision issued on March 1, 2007, which is the subject of the instant appeal, the Immigration Judge granted the DHS’s motion to rescind his order granting reopening. In pertinent part, the governing regulations provide that an Immigration Judge may reopen any case in which he has rendered a decision, “unless jurisdiction is vested with the Board of Immigration Appeals.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Furthermore, the Board has appellate jurisdiction over decisions of Immigration Judges in deportation cases. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(b)(2). Additionally, a request to reopen a case in which a decision has been made by the Board, which is made by the party affected by the decision, must be in the form of a written motion to the Board. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a)(1). Based on this authority, we agree with the Immigration Judge that jurisdiction became vested with the Board on June 13, 2003, when the respondent appealed the Immigration Judge’s denial of his January 24, 2003, motion to reopen (I.J. at 5 (3/1/07)). The cases cited by the respondent-Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974), and Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 156 (BIA 1998)—are distinguishable because they involved situations in which the Board permitted the filing of a motion to reopen with an Immigration Judge after dismissing an appeal of an earlier decision issued by the Immigration Judge for lack of jurisdiction (I.J. at 5 (3/1/07)). On the contrary, on November 25, 2003, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s January 24, 2003, motion to reopen on the merits (I.J. at 5 (3/1/07)). Therefore, we find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s March 1, 2007, decision and the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
*3 Turning to the respondent’s motion to reopen filed with the Board, we note that he is seeking to have the January 13, 1998, deportation order vacated and the proceedings terminated, or in the alternative, to be allowed to pursue section 212(c) relief in subsequent proceedings. The respondent claims that there is a basis in law for reopening these deportation proceedings, despite the fact that he physically departed from the United States pursuant to an order of deportation in 1998. Specifically, he argues that he is entitled to benefit from material changes in the law effectuated by Rivera-Sanchez, supra, and United States v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). He further claims that he has experienced a denial of due process, which is an extraordinary circumstance warranting sua sponte reopening. In immigration proceedings, however, collateral attack on an executed order of removal is warranted only when that order resulted in a “gross miscarriage of justice.” Matter of La Grotta, 14 I&N Dec. 110, 111-12 (BIA 1972). Furthermore, such a gross miscarriage of justice exists only when it can be conclusively determined, upon the basis of then-existing judicial and administrative decisions, that the prior finding of deportability was not in conformity with the law as interpreted at the time the order was entered and executed. Hernandez-Almanza v. INS, 547 F.2d 100, 102-03 (9th Cir. 1976); Matter of Farinas, 12 I&N Dec. 467 (BIA 1967); Matter of Malone, 11 I&N Dec. 730 (BIA 1966). With these principles in mind, we conclude that the respondent’s 1998 deportation order is not susceptible to collateral attack in these proceedings.
 
At the time of the respondent’s deportation in 1998, aliens in deportation proceedings who had been convicted of aggravated felonies were deemed to be categorically ineligible for section 212(c) relief. See Matter of Soriano, supra, at 533-40. While the Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court ultimately overruled the rationale of Matter of Soriano, those decisions were not issued until 1999 and 2001, respectively, well after the respondent’s deportation occurred (I.J. at 2, (3/1/07)). See St. Cyr, supra; Magana-Pizano v. INS, 200 F.3d 603 (9th Cir. 1999). Likewise, the Ninth Circuit had not yet adopted the framework requiring the application of the modified categorical approach to divisible statutes when determining removability in aggravated felony cases. See, e.g., Rivera-Sanchez, supra. Because the Immigration Judge’s January 13, 1998, determination that the respondent was deportable and ineligible for section 212(c) relief was in conformity with the law as interpreted at the time, we cannot find that the deportation order resulted in a “gross miscarriage of justice,” such that it is subject to collateral attack in the instant proceedings. Ramirez-Juarez v. INS, 622 F.2d 174, 175-76 (9th Cir. 1980); see also Robledo-Gonzales v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 667, 682 n. 13 (7th Cir. 2003). Specifically, the respondent’s 1998 deportation order is not invalidated simply because the law may have changed subsequent to the issuance of that order. Ramirez-Juarez, supra; see also Alvarenga-Villalobos v. Ashcroft, 271 F.3d 1169, 1172-73 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that a removal order that. was lawful when executed is not invalidated by subsequent changes in law) (citing Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 307-08 (1989)). Therefore, we conclude that the respondent’s 1998 deportation order did not violate his due process rights.¿FN1º

ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

Furthermore, we find that the cases cited by the respondent with respect to the “gross miscarriage of justice” issue are distinguishable. Unlike the scenarios in those cases, the respondent’s 1994 conviction for transportation/sale of a narcotic substance has not been vacated. See Cardoso-Tlaseca v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir. 2006); Estrada-Rosales v. INS, 645 F.2d 819 (9th Cir. 1981).

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on May 3, 2006, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our February 6, 2006, decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision finding her removable, and denying her application for adjustment of status. The respondent appealed our decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In an order issued January 24, 2007, the court granted the respondent’s unopposed motion to remand proceedings.
 
In the motion to remand the respondent contended the Board neglected to address the claim in her motion to reconsider that a remand was warranted as she was eligible for cancellation of removal. On remand the respondent newly alleges in a brief that she, in fact, did seek cancellation of removal during the proceedings before the Immigration Judge (Remand Br. at 3). The respondent avers the Immigration Judge and this Board erred by “ignor¿ingº her requests” for cancellation of removal, and failing to address her eligibility for such relief (Remand Br. at 7).¿FN1º She also maintains the Immigration Judge should have considered her eligibility for cancellation after determining she was ineligible for adjustment of status (Remand Br. at 8).
 
The respondent’s above-noted arguments contain misstatements of fact. During the proceedings below the respondent did initially indicate she wished to seek cancellation of removal in addition to adjustment of status (Tr. at 2). The Immigration Judge granted her a continuance of more than 11 months in which to submit any applications for relief, specifically referencing a cancellation application (Tr. at 3-4). However, when the hearing reconvened, the respondent indicated the only relief she intended to pursue was adjustment of status with a waiver of inadmissibility (Tr. at 7-10). To that end, the sole application for relief submitted by the respondent was for adjustment of status (Exhs. 2-3).¿FN2º Contrary to the arguments in her brief on remand, the respondent neither expressed any desire to pursue an application for cancellation of removal, nor did she submit the requisite application for such relief within the time limit set by the Immigration Judge. As such, she waived her opportunity to pursue an application for cancellation of removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (stating that an Immigration Judge may set and extend time limits for the filing of applications, and that if an application is not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application shall be deemed waived). Accordingly, we find no error in this regard.
 
*2 For the respondent’s benefit, we observe that her subsequent dissatisfaction with a strategic decision by counsel is not grounds to reopen unless she can show counsel behaved so egregiously that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B- et al., 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998) (finding no ineffective assistance of counsel where the attorney’s insistence on corroborating evidence discouraged the aliens from applying for asylum), citing Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931 (9th Cir. 1986); Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (absent a showing of egregious circumstances, a tactical decision by an attorney is binding on the alien). Here, the respondent has not alleged, much less established, she had ineffective assistance of counsel during the proceedings below. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637(BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Given these facts, we find no merit to her argument the Immigration Judge erred in not addressing her eligibility for cancellation of removal after her claim for adjustment failed. Absent showing that her counsel engaged in egregious conduct as noted, she cannot now recant her decision to pursue only one form of relief. Id. Therefore, we find no merit to these allegations of error.
 
In her brief on remand the respondent states she is currently pregnant with a United States citizen child, and asks that her case therefore be reopened for consideration of an application for cancellation of removal (Remand Br. at 11-13). This assertion is in the nature of a motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); see also Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). However, it is untimely, as it was filed more than 90 days after the Board decision she seeks to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent has not contended that her pregnancy constitutes an exception to this deadline, nor do we otherwise find as such. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). We also do not find that her pregnancy constitutes an exceptional circumstance exempting her from the time requirements for motions to reopen. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (Board retains limited discretionary power under the regulations to reopen or reconsider only in exceptional circumstances). Therefore, reopening in this regard is not warranted.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent contends it was “fundamentally unfair” for the Immigration Judge to find her ineligible for adjustment of status and conclude proceedings as the DHS had filed a new charge of removability against her only seven days before the hearing (Remand Br. at 8). However, the respondent neither raised this claim on appeal, nor was this part of the Circuit Court remand. As such, we do not find that this claim is properly before us. Moreover, this argument is in the nature of a motion to reconsider, and is untimely as it was filed more than 30 days after the Board decision she seeks to have reconsidered. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Therefore, reconsideration is not appropriate.

2

We note in neither her Notice of Appeal nor her appeal brief before the Board did the respondent contend she had presented a claim for cancellation that the Immigration Judge neglected to address. Thus, this issue was never presented before the Board, and we did not err in failing to address it in our initial decision.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen proceedings and remand to the Immigration Judge for a hearing on his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“the Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). He bases the motion on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and has submitted evidence to show that he has Complied with the requirements set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the motion.
 
The respondent has not alleged that the late filing of this motion was due to ineffective assistance of counsel, and it is denied as untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Moreover, we find that the prejudice required to establish ineffective assistance of counsel has not been shown. See Azanor v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2004) (stating that alien must demonstrate prejudice from counsel’s ineffective assistance in order to succeed on a due process challenge to an order entered in deportation proceedings); see also Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785 (9th Cir. 2005) (stating that the ineffective assistance must have been so fundamentally unfair that alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case). The respondent does not assert that he is not removable. He claims instead that the evidence to show his removability is not clear and convincing. We disagree. The documentary evidence in the record showing three drug possession convictions and the respondent’s admission that he was convicted of possession of methamphetamine and served 16 months (Tr. at 5) are sufficient to show that he is removable as charged.
 
With respect to the relief of cancellation of removal, the respondent has not shown that he is not barred from relief as an aggravated felon. See section 240A(a)(3) of the Act.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s March 19, 2007, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, as untimely.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, was ordered removed from the United States by an Immigration Judge on October 20, 2006, and the respondent waived appeal of that order. On January 19, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court. She contends, through counsel, that, although the motion was untimely, the 90-day Statutory deadline on filing motions to reopen should be equitably tolled in her case in view of her belief that she received ineffective assistance of counsel; she asserts that she accepted voluntary departure after being misinformed by previous counsel that she was barred from self-petitioning for adjustment of status, as a battered spouse, by reason of a lack of good moral character. The Immigration Judge concluded that, while the 90 day deadline is inapplicable where (1) the basis of the motion is to petition for relief as a battered spouse, (2) the motion is accompanied by a copy of the self-petition or cancellation of removal application, (3) the motion is filed within 1 year of the entry of the final order of removal, and (4) the alien is physically present in the United States when the motion is filed, the respondent’s motion contained neither a cancellation of removal application nor a copy of a self-petition. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(iv). The Immigration Judge further concluded that, with respect to her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent had not met the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent attesting to the relevant facts, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond, and, if it is asserted that prior counsel’s handling of the case involved a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, the motion should reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not). The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent had not been prejudiced as she was, in fact, ineligible to seek a waiver of her visa fraud conviction under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), so as to establish good moral character.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent reiterates her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, indicating that, as she first learned on December 20, 2006, that her previous counsel had erred, equitable tolling was appropriate. She also argues that the Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion was erroneous by failing to allow her to self-petition pursuant to section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv) of the Act, as she had not received a copy of her self petition (I-360) from her previous counsel.
 
We find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s decision. An alien seeking reopening of a removal order must file the required motion within 90 days after the entry of the final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23 (b)(1). The respondent did not comply with this requirement, and therefore her motion was properly dismissed as untimely. As to the respondent’s invocation of the equitable tolling doctrine, she provides no explanation as to why, having learned, on December 20, 2006, of the alleged misadvice by previous counsel, she was unable to file her motion in a timely fashion, by Thursday, January 18, 2007. While the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this proceeding arises, has held that the time for filing a motion to reopen can be equitably tolled, they declined to do so where, as here, no explanation for the failure to file the motion to reopen with the 90 day deadline is offered. See Harchenko v. INS, 379 F.3d 405, 409-410 (6th Cir. 2004). Furthermore, while the Immigration Judge may waive the 1 year filing deadline to reopen proceedings pursuant to section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv), where there is a showing of exceptional circumstances, the statute requires, without exception, that the motion be accompanied by either a cancellation of removal application or a copy of the self-petition that has been or will be filed with Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Thus, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Edgardo Quintanilla, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Angela M. Fontova
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 28, 2007. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and denied the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), in the exercise of discretion. On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not considering the respondent’s alcoholism and drug abuse as a disease. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (e)(5). We find that the respondent’s arguments on appeal fail to establish error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent failed to establish that he warranted cancellation of removal in the exercise of discretion. See Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7, 11 (BIA 1998) (finding that the Court “must balance the adverse factors evidencing the alien’s undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented on his behalf to determine whether the granting of… relief appears in the best interest of this country.”). Although the respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge should have considered his alcoholism and drug abuse as a disease, we note that the respondent first raises this argument on appeal and has failed to establish that the documentary evidence submitted with his appellate brief to support this argument was not available and could not have been presented before the Immigration Judge. The Board does not consider evidence first offered on appeal as our review is a review of the record created before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Federenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984). Inasmuch as the respondent did not raise this argument before the Immigration Judge and the respondent has not established that the evidence submitted on appeal to support this argument is new and previously unavailable, we decline to consider the respondent’s argument. Furthermore, while the respondent contends that his prior counsel committed ineffective assistance by not raising such an argument before the Immigration Judge, we note that an attorney’s tactical decisions in the preparation and presentation of an alien’s case do not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931,934 (9th Cir. 1986); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The decision of the respondent’s prior counsel to proceed on a different theory of the case does not establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. Lastly, we find insufficient evidence to establish bias on the part of the Immigration Judge or a violation of the respondent’s due process rights. The portion of the transcript quoted in the respondent’s appellate brief does not indicate that the Immigration Judge improperly questioned the respondent or that the Immigration Judge exhibited bias in considering the evidence regarding the respondent’s alcohol and drug abuse.
 
*2 In light of the foregoing, we find that the respondent has failed to establish that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that the adverse factors of record, including his convictions for Use/Influence of a Controlled Substance, Theft, Burglary, Driving Under the Influence, Driving with a Suspended License, and Lewd Conduct, outweighed the favorable factors of record. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the best interests of this country would not be served by granting cancellation of removal to the respondent. See Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581,.584 (BIA 1978). Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Oscar L. Amorow, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Remand; waiver of inadmissibility
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Haiti, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s November 29, 2005, decision insofar as her application for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), was denied. During the pendency of the appeal, she filed a motion asserting that she received ineffective assistance by her former attorney, Mr. Josselin Saint-Preux,¿FN1º regarding the preparation and presentation of her application for section 212(c) relief, and requesting that the record be remanded to permit her an opportunity to supplement the record regarding that application.
 
Regarding the motion, although the respondent asserts ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of Mr. Saint-Preux, her motion fails to satisfy the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) for making such a claim. Attached to the motion is a brief letter from the respondent’s current attorney to Mr. Saint-Preux regarding the representation she received in conjunction with her section 212(c) application, but this is no substitute for an affidavit by the respondent herself of the type discussed in Matter of Lozada, supra. There also has been no showing that the respondent filed a complaint against Mr. Saint-Preux with the appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding the claimed violations of his ethical or legal responsibilities, and she has not explained why she failed to do so. Id.
 
In her motion, she also asks for an opportunity to present additional evidence to support her section 212(c) application. However, she neither submitted nor sufficiently detailed the additional evidence of which she seeks consideration, and she has failed to persuasively explain how the consideration of additional evidence would alter the decision reached in her case. Accordingly, the motion to remand is denied.
 
Regarding the respondent’s appeal, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s discretionary denial of section 212(c) relief in this case based on the record before her. Moreover, the appellate arguments being advanced do not persuade us to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision. Accordingly, we adopt and affirm and adopt the Immigration Judge’s November 29, 2005, decision and dismiss the respondent’s appeal. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872 (BIA 1994). The request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7) (2007).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to remand is denied and the appeal is dismissed. The request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7) (2007).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frank T. Morell, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christopher J. Reeber
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings; cancellation of removal
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. She appeals an Immigration Judge’s March 22, 2006, decision finding her inadmissible to the United states under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i), denying her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), and ordering her removed to Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a response brief in support of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred by considering whether the respondent, a returning lawful permanent resident of the United States, was inadmissible without first determining whether she had engaged in illegal activity after having departed the United States. See section 101(a)(13)(C)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(iii). This argument is unpersuasive, as the Immigration Judge observed that the illegal activity in which the respondent had engaged was the very activity underlying the alien smuggling charge. See I.J. at 6; Exh. 1. Cf. United States v. Tsai, 282 F.3d 690, 696 n.5 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that the returning lawful permanent resident alien was properly regarded as seeking admission to the United States because he “ha¿dº engaged in illegal activity after having departed the United States,” that being “the alien smuggling activity”). As the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had engaged in illegal activity after departing the United States, he properly found that she was subject to the grounds of inadmissibility enumerated at section 212 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182. See generally section 101(a)(13)(C)(iii) of the Act.
 
The respondent further argues that the Immigration Judge erred in relying on evidence that had been entered into the record as a result of former counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance. However, the respondent has neither substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), nor demonstrated a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” See Granados-Oseguera v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 993, 997-99 (9th Cir. 2006); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002). Cf. Exh. 27 (confirming that current counsel was substituted in as attorney of record on June 9, 2005); Tr. at 29, 134 (current counsel’s confirmation that the respondent had filed no objections to the DHS’s proffered evidence). See also Tr. at 30 (current counsel’s explanation regarding why he failed to obtain copies of exhibits included in the record of proceedings prior to the June 30, 2005, hearing). We do not find merit in the respondent’s unsupported assertion that the Immigration Judge deemed prior counsel’s assistance to have been ineffective, particularly in light of the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent would be bound by the actions of prior counsel. See Tr. at 115 (Immigration Judge noted that the respondent was bound by the actions of prior counsel). Cf. Tr. at 113 (vague comment regarding effectiveness of prior representation, which does not reveal that the Immigration Judge found prior counsel to have provided ineffective assistance). Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated that she suffered prejudice as a result of prior counsel’s failure to object to the DHS’s proffered evidence, as such evidence is routinely received in removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.7(a) (providing that an Immigration Judge may receive into evidence prior statements such as those received during the respondent’s removal proceedings). See also Tr. at 124-27, 148-56 (evidencing respondent’s opportunity to cross-examine preparers of two key documents included in the record or proceedings). We therefore find that the respondent has failed to establish that she experienced prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel during the course of her removal proceedings. See generally Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 We agree, however, with the respondent’s contention that the Immigration Judge should not have relied on the written admissions and concession submitted by former counsel (Exh. 6), as the Immigration Judge had indicated that the respondent would not be bound by the withdrawn admission and concession. See I.J. at 15-16; Tr. at 19, 113. Nevertheless, the Immigration Judge’s reliance on the withdrawn submission is harmless error, as the record supports the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent was involved in alien smuggling activity, as defined in section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act, even if we disregard the respondent’s earlier concession.¿FN1º See, e.g., Exh. 18 (Report of Investigation, indicating that the respondent previously stated that she was asked to provide transportation to the smugglee, that she realized while in the vehicle that the passport held by the smugglee did not in fact pertain to the her, and that the driver of the vehicle had accompanied the respondent on the trip to Mexico simply because the respondent did not feel well enough to drive); Tr. at 67-68, 82-83, 97 (respondent’s testimony that, prior to her departure for Mexico, her husband requested that she transport the smugglee into the United States, and that she asked her husband about the smugglee’s immigration status and was told that the individual was a United States citizen), 83, 87, 93-94, 96, 105 (respondent’s testimony that she asked to see the smugglee’s documents, and realized that the photograph did not look like the smugglee), 148-56 (respondent’s counsel’s cross-examination of the officer who created the Report of Investigation).
 
The Immigration Judge properly distinguished the respondent’s participation in the smuggling activity under consideration in the instant case from the alien’s limited connection to the smuggling activity at issue in Altamirano v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 586 (9th Cir. 2005). See I.J. at 14-15. Whereas, in Altamirano v. Gonzales, supra, the alien simply had knowledge of the smuggling plan and was present in the vehicle in which her family members were attempting to smuggle an undocumented alien, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent was an active participant in the scheme to procure the smugglee’s entrance into the United States. See I.J. at 14-15. See also Tr. at 82-83, 97, 100 (respondent’s testimony that her husband asked her and a neighbor to transport his niece’s friend into the United States). Moreover, in Altamirano v. Gonzales, supra, the Immigration Judge did not question the alien’s credibility. See Altamirano v. Gonzales, supra, at 589 n.2. In contrast, the Immigration Judge gave specific, cogent reasons for disbelieving the respondent’s version of events. Notably, although the respondent disclaims involvement in the scheme to bring the smugglee into the United States, and testified that she did not know of the smugglee’s lack of authorization to enter the United States until after they were placed in secondary inspection, the record reveals that she previously had stated to an immigration officer that she had been asked to transport the smugglee from Mexico into the United States, and that upon picking up the smugglee she realized that the passport that the smugglee had in her possession did not in fact pertain to the smugglee. See I.J. at 10-12, 14, 17-18. Compare Tr. at 50 with Exh. 18 and Tr. at 142-56.
 
*3 Similarly, the respondent’s appellate assertion that the driver of the automobile involved in the smuggling incident was responsible for arranging the transportation of the smugglee is belied by her testimony before the Immigration Judge. See Tr. at 82-83 (respondent’s assertion that she did not ask the driver about the smugglee’s immigration status prior to departing the United States for Mexico because he “did not know ¿the smuggleeº. It ¿wasº not on the side of ¿the driverº”). Based on the foregoing, we find that the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent was an active participant in the plan to transport the smugglee into the United States is not clearly erroneous, and we therefore affirm the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent engaged in the illegal activity of alien smuggling after departing the United States. We consequently affirm the Immigration Judge’s corollary finding that the respondent is inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act.
 
Turning next to the respondent’s application for relief from removal, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(2). The record does not support the respondent’s appellate contention that, but for brief and casual departures from the United States, she has continually resided in the United States since she was purportedly admitted as a nonimmigrant visitor when she was approximately 2 years of age. Cf. Exh. 21 (indicating that respondent first entered the United States in 1995 without inspection, and noting that she gave birth to three children in Mexico between the years of 1980 and 1986). Furthermore, we are unpersuaded by the respondent’s unsubstantiated assertion that Mexican culture requires a wife to live with and follow the direction of her husband and that, therefore, the husband’s period of residence should be imputed to the wife pursuant to an extension of the holding in Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2005). The record supports the Immigration Judge’s finding that the relevant date of admission is the date of the respondent’s admission to the United States as a lawful permanent resident, which was April 18, 2002. See I.J. at 18-20; Exh. 8. Pursuant to the “stop-time rule,” the respondent’s opportunity to accrue the requisite 7 years of residence after admission in any status halted when she was issued a Notice to Appear on April 9, 2004. See Exh. 1. See also sections 240A(a)(1), (d)(1) of the Act. The respondent therefore accrued a maximum of approximately 2 years of continuous, post-admission residence, rather than the necessary 7 years. See I.J. at 21. The Immigration Judge thus properly determined that the respondent is unable to establish statutory eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act.
 
*4 Finally, the respondent also asserts on appeal that the immigration court’s policy regarding change of venue is unconstitutional because it requires that an alien concede removability before a motion for change of venue will even be considered. However, we are without authority to consider such constitutional challenges. See, e.g., Matter of Fede, 20 I&N Dec. 35, 36 (BIA 1989).
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Likewise, any confusion regarding whether the smugglee was the niece of the respondent’s husband, or a friend of such niece (I.J. at 10, 14, 16-17; Tr. at 83), also amounts to harmless error, as the record supports the Immigration Judge’s ultimate resolution of the respondent’s case irrespective of the identity of the smugglee.

John McPhail
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s February 22, 2007, decision finding him removable from the United States and pretermitting his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1229b. The appeal is dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that he was not convicted of an aggravated felony. Also, he avers that the Immigration Judge erred in ordering him removed during a master calendar hearing. In that regard, he asserts that the Immigration Judge should have allowed him additional time to present his case. Last, he claims that he was ineffectively represented by his former counsels.
 
The record reveals that the respondent sustained a 2003 conviction for delivery of marijuana in a drug free zone.¿FN1º See TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§ 481.120, 481.134. The Immigration Judge determined that this offense qualified as an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B), and we find no reversible error in that determination. According to the United States Supreme Court, a state drug offense qualifies as a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and, by extension, an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act if the offense would have been punishable as a felony under the Federal Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”), 21 U.S.C. § 802 et seq. Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 47, 127 S. Ct. 625, 630-31 (2006). The Texas offense of delivery of marijuana is comparable to the federal offense of marijuana distribution, which is punishable under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D) by a term of imprisonment of up to 5 years, making it a federal “felony.” Lopez v. Gonzales, supra, at 631 n.7 (holding that “for purposes of § 924(c)(2) the crimes the CSA defines as ‘felonies’ are those crimes to which it assigns a punishment exceeding one year’s imprisonment.”). 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(4) provides an exception for one who distributed a “small amount of marijuana for no remuneration” however; documents in the record reflect that the respondent transferred marijuana to a minor in exchange for a sum of United States currency.¿FN2º Hence, the offense did involve marijuana “trafficking” in the conventional sense of that term. Accordingly, we agree that as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3).
 
*2 Also, we do not find error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to proceed with the respondent’s removal hearing and order him removed during a master calendar hearing. The respondent had appeared before the Immigration Judge on 2 occasions. During the respondent’s second master calendar hearing, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was ineligible for the relief that he sought and thus ordered him removed. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the Immigration Judge had acted in an inappropriate manner by proceeding with the removal hearing.
 
Last, the respondent raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, but fails to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also, Lara v. Trominiski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000). While he submitted copies of letters that he allegedly mailed to his former attorneys, there is nothing in the record to show that the letters had been delivered or received by his former counsels. Furthermore, he has not filed a complaint with the necessary entered into with his former counsels. Based on the record before us, we do not find that the respondent was ineffectively represented.
 
In conclusion, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is removable as charged and does not appear to be eligible for any form of relief. Accordingly, his appeal is dismissed.

Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(4), a defendant who demonstrates that he distributed “a small amount of marihuana for no remuneration” may be punished as a misdemeanant rather than a felon. 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(4) does not define a discrete offense, however; rather, it is a sentencing provision that describes a “mitigating exception” to the otherwise-applicable 5-year statutory maximum called for by 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D). See, e.g., United States v. Hamlin, 319 F.3d 666, 670-71 (4th Cir. 2003) (federal prosecutor seeking a 5-year sentence against a marijuana distributor not required by Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the amount of marijuana distributed was “large” or that remuneration was present); United States v. Outen, 286 F.3d 622, 638 (2d Cir. 2002) (same). Thus, it is the defendant who must prove the additional facts (i.e., the “smallness” of the amount of marijuana and the absence of remuneration) that trigger the exception. In the absence of any evidentiary showing by the respondent that he would have qualified for this mitigating exception had he been prosecuted federally, we conclude that the proper federal analogue for his state crime is felony marijuana distribution. Cf. Matter of P-F-, 20 I&N Dec. 661, 663 n.2 (BIA 1993).

June 29, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Martin Resendez Guajardo, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(C), I&NAct ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C)º - Controlled substance trafficker
  
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s March 7, 2006, decision ordering the respondent removed from the United States as an alien who the Attorney General knows or has reason to believe is or has been an illicit trafficker in any controlled substance. See section 212(a)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C). The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7).
 
The respondent was apprehended in May 2005, when he applied for admission at San Francisco International Airport as a returning lawful permanent resident. At that time the respondent was paroled into the United States for deferred inspection. His parole was subsequently revoked, a Notice to Appear was issued and he was placed in removal proceedings. We agree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the court documents of record support the immigration inspector’s conclusion that at the time of the respondent’s attempted entry into the United States, there was “reason to believe” that he was or had been an illicit trafficker in marijuana or cannabis. Id.; Fla. Stat. § 893.13(1)(c)(2). It is noted for the record that the respondent conceded that he sold marijuana in Florida in 1995. Tr. at 12.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he plead nolo contendere in his criminal proceedings, and therefore was not convicted within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and thus not removable or inadmissible. This argument is without merit. The ground of inadmissibility under which the respondent was charged, is not one that requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to prove an actual conviction exists under drug trafficking laws in order to sustain the charge, despite the respondent’s assertions to the contrary. See section 212(a)(2)(C); see also Molina v. Ashcroft, 368 F.3d 1206 (9th Cir. 2004); Alarcon-Serrano v. INS, 220 F.3d 1116 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
The respondent also claims that his prior attorney was ineffective. A claim based on ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the claim be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representation counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and, (3) that the claim reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553,556 (BIA 2003); cf. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 It is noted that respondent has failed to meet the above-noted requirements of prongs one and three. Additionally, although the respondent did forward a letter to prior counsel on October 31, 2006, no response is contained in the record of proceedings currently before this Board. It should also be noted that the record contains a letter from the respondent’s prior counsel, which serves as notification of his withdrawal. This letter states that on five occasions prior counsel attempted to contact the respondent and further, that the Respondent owes a substantial amount of money to his prior counsel.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Stephen M. Ruhle
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case shall be remanded. The respondent has asserted ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has requested that the Board summarily affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The DHS argues that the respondent failed to meet the requirements as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The record of proceeding contains an EOIR-28, indicating that the respondent was represented by counsel at his hearing before the Immigration Judge. The respondent’s counsel was informed by the Immigration Judge of the due date for the respondent’s application for cancellation relief (Tr. at 36). The application was not filed by the March 16, 2007, deadline and by written decision dated March 19, 2007, the Immigration Judge deemed the application as abandoned.
 
In asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has indicated that he was surprised to receive the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent asserts that he was under the impression that his attorney would comply with the deadline. The respondent has included copies of several letters he sent to his attorney via certified mail indicating that he was upset, and seeking clarification. We find that the respondent, who is pro se on appeal, has substantially complied with the Lozada requirements. The respondent’s letters indicate that there was an issue over respondent’s lack of full payment to the attorney of record. However, there is no letter of request to withdraw as respondent’s attorney. In fact, the record of proceeding does not show any further communication with the court by the respondent’s attorney of record after the December 19, 2006, hearing. Upon review of the record as a whole, we find that although the respondent has not fully complied with the requirements as set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, he has clearly demonstrated that he was prejudiced. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 533 (BIA 2003).
 
Finally, The respondent contests his detention and raises issues related to the determination of his bond. We note that any such issues are not properly before this Board as such concerns shall be separate and apart from any removal hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(d). We therefore remand the record to the Immigration Judge to afford the respondent a further opportunity to submit an application for cancellation relief based on the aforementioned.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Diana Cobar, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael D. Steinberg
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)º - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 11182(a)(6)(C)(i)º - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
 
  
APPLICATION: Section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver
 
On March 20, 2006, an Immigration Judge issued a decision finding the respondent removable as charged under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), as an alien inadmissible based on fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i). The Immigration Judge did not find that the respondent was subject to removal based on the charge under 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act as he was not an arriving alien. The Immigration Judge rejected the respondent’s request for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act of the sustained ground of removal, and ordered him removed to the Philippines.
 
The respondent appeals, asserting ineffective assistance of counsel. He moves to remand the proceedings so that the Immigration Judge can consider evidence relevant to the fraud underpinning his removability charge¿FN1º. The motion to remand will be denied, and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent sets forth his claim of ineffective assistance in accordance with the framework established in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In addition to the procedural requirements, however, he must also establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of counsel’s ineffectiveness. See Id. at 640. The respondent must demonstrate that counsel’s performance was so inadequate that it “may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal citation omitted). Here, the respondent asserts that he provided former counsel with evidence that, unbeknownst to him, his wife had previously entered into a marriage that was never terminated. He contends that, since his marriage was void ab initio, he was not in fact married when he entered the United States and thus did not make a false statement that he was the unmarried son of a lawful permanent resident. The respondent asserts that former counsel disregarded the evidence proving the marriage was void and instead advised him to admit he was legally married and pursue a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act. He reasons that the evidence of his void marriage is new since counsel’s ineffective assistance prevented its submission earlier in the proceedings.
 
*2 The underlying removal charge at issue here, section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act, provides:
Any alien who, by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact, seeks to procure (or has sought to procure or has procured) a visa, other documentation, or admission into the United States or other benefit provided under this Act is inadmissible.
 
Section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act. The respondent testified that when he entered the United States in 1995, he told immigration officials that he was unmarried despite marrying his wife in 1986, because he was uncertain whether the marriage was valid. Tr. at 16, 18-19. Further, when he filed a visa petition in 1996 on behalf of his wife, following his return to the Philippines and a second marriage to that same wife, he did not disclose the 1986 marriage. Id. at 19. Since the respondent admitted that he was unsure whether he was a party to a valid marriage, his assertion to immigration officials that he was not married, and his failure to disclose the fact of the 1986 marriage on the visa petition for his wife, were willful misrepresentations of a material fact in order to obtain visas. The dispositive factor is the respondent’s conduct in averring unequivocally that he was unmarried when actually he had entered into a marriage that may have been valid. That conduct constituted a willful misrepresentation to obtain an immigration benefit, irrespective of the respondent’s subsequent discovery that the marriage was not legitimate.
 
Since the respondent admitted that he had willfully misrepresented his marital status on two occasions, any failure by former counsel to submit evidence that the marriage was void did not result in prejudice because such evidence could not cure the misrepresentation. Thus, the respondent cannot sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel, and we see no basis to remand the record for consideration of the evidence which would not alter the outcome. We further find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent was removable, or that he was ineligible for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

FILE: AXX XX7 788 - LOS FRESNOS, TX
June 21, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Finees M. Casado, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Gregory J. Ball,
Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on March 30, 2007, when we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider that decision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.39; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(G) (summary dismissal of appeal appropriate where appeal is barred based on waiver of right to appeal).
 
The respondent now suggests that his waiver of appeal was invalid because of erroneous legal advice he was given. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001) (a party wishing to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or an appeal directly with the Board). He argues that he received ineffective assistance from a professional inmate legal assistance group. However, he has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he or she was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has provided no affidavit setting forth the agreement with this legal organization, has not shown that this group has been given the opportunity to respond to the allegations, and has not filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority. The assertion in the motion that the respondent intends to comply with the procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel only if the case is first reopened, see Respondent’s Motion, at page 5, is insufficient as a reason to excuse the failure to comply with the Lozada requirements.
 
*2 Moreover, the respondent does not explain why he did not raise the claim of ineffective assistance in his appeal, when he knew or should have known of the alleged erroneous advice and had already retained counsel at that point. Consequently, we find no error in our prior decision summarily dismissing the appeal. See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir. 2000)(the decision to reopen proceedings is a discretionary decision, and this court applies a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard when reviewing the BIA’s denial of a motion to reopen).
 
We therefore lack jurisdiction over this case, and we find no error in our prior decision. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Accordingly, the motion is denied and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.52, 1240.53, and 1241.31.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jaak Olesk, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - Nonimmigrant - remained longer than permitted (withdrawn)

Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 8, 2007, is affirmed. On appeal, the respondent contends that he was subject to ineffective assistance of counsel by his criminal attorney. The pendency of post-conviction motions or other forms of collateral attacks, not constituting direct appeals, do not serve to negate the finality of the conviction or the charge of deportability, unless and until the conviction has been overturned pursuant to that motion. See Grageda v. INS, 12 F.3d 919, 921 (9th Cir. 1993)(holding that collateral attacks on convictions in state court have no impact on their finality, and finding that Immigration Judge did not err in denying request for continuance so respondent could pursue motion to vacate conviction in California state court); Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894 (BIA 1994); see also Okabe v. INS, 671 F.2d 863 (5th Cir. 1982); Aguilera-Enriquez v. INS, 516 F.2d 565 (6th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1050 (1976). In addition, the respondent is precluded from collaterally attacking his criminal record of conviction in a removal proceeding. See Urbina-Mauricio v. INS, 989 F.2d 1085 (9th Cir. 1993). The respondent also contends that his immigration counsel rendered ineffective assistance during the removal hearing. The respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In some cases, the Ninth Circuit has not required strict compliance with Lozada requirements, especially when the record shows “a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir.2002). However, the respondent’s contention is conclusory in nature and he has made no such showing. See Puga v. Chertoff, 488F.3d812 2007 WL 1500308 (9th Cir. May 24, 2007).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent suggests that he may be eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), but it is evident that his criminal conviction renders him statutorily ineligible for such relief pursuant to section 240A(b)(1)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1)(C). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: SEGUNDO ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ
FILE: AXX XX2 683 - NEWARK
June 15, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sigang Li, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on February 14, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s November 9, 2004, decision finding that the respondent had abandoned his applications for relief and ordering him deported to the Dominican Republic.
 
On May 1, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen these proceedings based on a claim of ineffective assistance by his prior counsel, Ms. Vinaya Saijwani. The motion was not filed within the statutory and regulatory 90-day time limit for filing a motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent argues that we should equitably toll the 90-day time limit on filing motions to reopen based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has held that aliens raising an ineffective assistance claim in a motion can have the time limits on motions equitably toiled. See Mahmood v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 248 (3rd Cir. 2005).
 
We find that equitable tolling is warranted in this case. The respondent has substantially complied with the procedural steps set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and has demonstrated that Ms. Saijwani’s conduct has prejudiced his case. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Ms. Saijwani admitted that due to her personal problems she failed to timely file the respondent’s applications for relief from removal. Nevertheless, she continued to represent the respondent on appeal and never asserted that her own conduct constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent also contends that Ms. Saijwani failed to inform him of our February 14, 2006, decision until after he was detained on April 23, 2007. Ms. Saijwani, who has been notified of the respondent’s claim, has not challenged the respondent’s assertions of misconduct. The respondent, by and through new counsel, exercised due diligence by filing the instant motion to reopen within days of learning of our prior order.
 
Although the respondent asserts that he is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), he has not proffered his application in support of this motion. In light of the facts of this case and the failure to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to object or otherwise respond to this motion, we will grant the respondent’s reopening to afford him the opportunity to apply for relief from removal. While we find reopening appropriate in this case, the respondent must establish his eligibility for cancellation of removal despite his 1991 conviction for conspiracy to illegally acquire and possess food stamps.
 
*2 The respondent also claims that Ms. Saijwani should have filed a motion to terminate so that he could pursue his pending naturalization application. See Respondent’s Motion at 4. While the respondent may file such a motion in remanded proceedings, we make no judgment on its merits given the respondent’s 1991 conviction. See generally Matter of Acosta Hidalgo, 24 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2007) (removal proceedings may only be terminated pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1239.2(f) where the DHS has presented an affirmative communication attesting to the alien’s prima facie eligibility for naturalization). The appropriate orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent, with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sufen Hilf, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on October 31, 2006, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our July 10, 2006, decision in which we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s October 25, 2005, decision denying the respondent’s October 11, 2005, motions to reconsider and reopen proceedings.
 
On January 26, 2007, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen based, in part, on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent contends that this motion is timely filed. See Respondent’s Motion at 5. We disagree. Our July 10, 2006, decision (dismissing the respondent’s appeal) remains the final administrative order in this case.¿FN1º See Matter of L-V-K-, 22 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1999) (stating that an administrative decision becomes final when the Board reaches a decision on appeal). Thus, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before October 10, 2006. Also, as the respondent previously filed a motion to reopen (October 11, 2005, motion to reopen and reconsider filed before the Immigration Judge), his motion is number barred. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7) (stating that a party may file only one motion to reopen, and that such a motion must be filed within 90 days following the date of the final administrative decision); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
Therefore, the instant motion is time and number barred unless the respondent can establish that he falls within an exception to these statutory and regulatory limitations on motions to reopen. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has held that equitable tolling can apply to the time limits on motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See Tapia-Martinez v. Gonzales, 482 F.3d 417 (6th Cir. 2007). Although, the Sixth Circuit has not specifically held that equitable tolling applies to numerical limitations on motions to reopen. Id.
 
The pivotal issue before us is whether the respondent has established that equitable tolling is warranted based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent asserts that all three of his prior attorneys - Mr. Nadadur Sampath Kumar, Ms. Vera Weisz, and Mr. David Wegner were ineffective. The respondent has complied with the procedural steps set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Respondent’s Motion at 7-8, Attachments 6, 8, and 17. We need not consider the claims raised against all three attorneys because we find that Mr. Wegner’s representation was ineffective and prejudiced the respondent’s removal proceedings. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Given the respondent’s due diligence, we find equitable toiling is warranted in this case.
 
*2 On September 15, 2005, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had abandoned his applications for relief because they were not filed on or before the August 12, 2005, deadline and ordered the respondent removed from the United States. Mr. Wegner filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge explaining that he did not timely file the respondent’s applications because he believed that since the date of the merits hearing was postponed, the applications deadline would also be postponed. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion and on July 10, 2006, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision. Mr. Wegner cited no authority for his mistaken belief that the Immigration Judge’s application filing deadline was altered when the merits hearing was postponed. Yet, he continued to inform the respondent that the Immigration Judge’s decision was “totally unjust.” See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Attachment 8(c)(i) (Mr. Wegner’s September 27, 2005, letter to the respondent). Mr. Wegner continued to make this argument when he filed a motion to reconsider with this Board on August 9, 2006. But for Mr. Wegner’s mistake, the respondent’s adjustment application would have been timely filed. The respondent’s motion is supported by evidence that he is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Attachment 16.
 
The respondent has also demonstrated that he exercised due diligence from the time he discovered Mr. Wegner’s ineffectiveness. After we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider on October 31, 2006, the respondent apparently began to question Mr. Wegner’s judgment and conduct. By November 2006, he retained new counsel, filed a Freedom of Information Act request, and on January 26, 2007, he filed the instant motion to reopen.
 
Finally, we come to the issue of whether the respondent is precluded from applying for adjustment of status because he failed to voluntarily depart pursuant to a 120-day grant of voluntary departure by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Officer John Brechtel on July 19, 2003. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Attachments 4 and 6(c)(i) (Form 1-210). In light of our recent decision in Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87 (BIA 2007), and given the facts and circumstances of this case, we find that the respondent’s failure to depart pursuant to the DHS order was not voluntary. Notably, the respondent has proffered evidence showing that Office Brechtel may have rescinded the grant of voluntary departure. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Attachments 6(d) and (e), and 7. Additionally, there is no evidence that voluntary departure as granted by the DHS in this case is contractual in nature as is the voluntary departure granted by an Immigration Judge. Matter of Zmijewska, spura at 93.
 
Based on the foregoing, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen and remand the record to that the respondent can apply for relief from removal.
 
*3 ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio M. Zaldana, Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lee P. Crystal
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us when in a decision dated May 12, 1997, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 12, 1997, as untimely filed and not properly before us. On November 24, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, and seeking to reapply for relief pursuant to the former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001) (restrictions on section 212(c) relief do not apply retroactively to aliens who pled guilty prior to April 24, 1996, the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA)). The respondent’s motion is granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.
 
Although the motion is untimely filed, the respondent claims that he should receive the benefit of “equitable tolling” of the filing deadline because the attorney who earlier represented him, Jose M. Quinones, who was since suspended from practice before the Board, failed to file a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s February 12, 1997, decision, after allegedly placing the matter in the hands of a “notario,” and then failed to tell him of our final order. The respondent has not complied with all the procedural requirements we set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, but as this case falls under the jurisdiction of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has held that rigid adherence to the Lozada requirements is not always required, we find the respondent has presented a prima facie case of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525-526 (9th Cir 2000) (Lozada requirements generally reasonable, but full compliance is not required if the record independently shows that the “ineffective assistance” claim is legitimate and substantial); see also Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir 1999) (the court found the statute of limitations to reopen an order of deportation is equitably tolled where the alien’s late petition is the result of the deceptive actions by a notary posing as an attorney). Consequently, even though the respondent’s motion is untimely filed, applying Ninth Circuit precedent, we find that the respondent’s situation falls within the Ninth Circuit’s “equitable tolling” policy. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001).
 
*2 A “motion to reopen proceedings seeks to reopen proceedings so that new evidence can be presented and so that a new decision can be entered, normally after a further evidentiary hearing.” Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 403 (BIA 1991). Such a motion may not be granted unless the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Finally, an alien must establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought before a motion to reopen will be granted. Matter of Gutierrez, 21 I&N Dec. 479, 482 (BIA 1996). Here, the respondent has demonstrated that consistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St. Cyr, supra, and the new section 212(c) regulation found at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(a), he is no longer precluded from establishing his eligibility for a waiver on inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act, and that reopening of the proceedings is warranted.
 
Accordingly, the Board’s May 12, 1997, decision will be vacated, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings to allow the respondent the opportunity to establish his eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(c) of the Act, or any other form of relief to which he may be entitled.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s May 12, 1997, decision is vacated, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard A. Bimbaum, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Seth B. Fitter
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
 
The respondent has filed an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s order dated February 24, 2006. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Egypt. Prior to being placed in removal proceedings, he married a United States citizen. The respondent’s wife filed an immediate relative visa petition (Form I-130) on behalf of the respondent on September 16, 2003. The respondent filed an adjustment of status application at the same time. The Immigration Judge granted the respondent several continuances to allow the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) time to adjudicate the Form I-130 visa petition (Tr. at 1-2, 7, 10-12, 13-14). On August 14, 2005, the Immigration Judge stated that if the visa petition were still pending at the next scheduled hearing date (February 24, 2006), the respondent could move for another continuance (Tr. at 14).
 
On February 24, 2006, a new Immigration Judge was assigned to the matter (Tr. at 15). The respondent’s attorney advised the Immigration Judge that the DHS had instructed him that it would not adjudicate the respondent’s visa petition until after the Immigration Judge issued a decision in the case (Tr. at 18-22). The respondent’s attorney inquired about the possibility of an order of administrative closure, and the attorney for the DHS opposed such an order (Tr. at 16-17). When voluntary departure was raised as a potential form of relief, the respondent was asked what he wanted to do (Tr. at 23-26). The respondent stated that he wanted a continuance (Tr. at 26). A brief recess was held, and after the recess the respondent’s counsel advised the Immigration Judge that the respondent said he wanted a continuance (Tr. at 27-28). The Immigration Judge concluded that since the DHS was apparently refusing to adjudicate the visa petition, the Immigration Judge would have to issue an order of removal or an order of voluntary departure (Tr. at 28). The respondent was then qualified for voluntary departure and granted voluntary departure (Tr. at 29-35). Through counsel, the respondent waived appeal (Tr. at 36).
 
The respondent now alleges that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his hearing because counsel should have moved for a continuance and if the motion were denied, should have appealed from the order of the Immigration Judge. The respondent contends that under controlling law, the Immigration Judge was obligated to grant continuances until the visa petition was adjudicated. See Benslimane v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 828 (7th Cir. 2005); Subhan v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 591 (7th Cir. 2004).
 
*2 In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), affd, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), we held that ineffective assistance claims require: (1) that the respondent submit an affidavit detailing the agreement between the respondent and his counsel; (2) that the attorney whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the respondent state whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the respondent establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
The respondent has complied with the requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. See Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498, 501 (7th Cir. 2001). He has complied with the technical requirements and has also established that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance that rendered the proceedings unfair. The respondent’s former counsel should have been aware of controlling law that required the Immigration Judge to grant continuances in cases such as this one. Because of his former counsel’s actions, the respondent waived appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision, a decision that effectively, and improperly, denied the respondent an opportunity to have a hearing on his application for adjustment of status.
 
Accordingly, we will sustain the appeal and will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The order of the Immigration Judge dated February 24, 2006, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the issuance of a new decision.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lisa A. Baird, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Bruce B. Dizengoff
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; section 212(c) waiver
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from a December 19, 2005, decision of an Immigration Judge, denying his motion to reopen proceedings following the previous entry of an in absentia order of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be sustained.
 
The respondent argues that he was deprived of due process as a consequence of ineffective assistance of his former counsel and as such, he has not had a fair hearing in these proceedings. See section 240(b)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(A); see also Xu Yong Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127 (3rd Cir. 2001). The respondent has not complied with the mandatory requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and we thus decline to sustain the appeal based on ineffective assistance of counsel, for the reasons set forth in Matter of Lozada at 639-40.
 
We will, however, under the unusual circumstances of this case, remand the record for further proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). No single circumstance, on its own, leads us to conclude that a remand is necessary, but the sum total of the circumstances presented in this case leads us to the conclusion that the exceptional circumstances necessary for sua sponte reopening (or, analogously, remand) exist in this case. Cf. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We first note that the respondent does not have appeared to attempt to delay these proceedings in any way. Cf. INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 108 (1988) (discussing the heavy burden a party filing a motion to reopen bears and the government’s legitimate interest in discouraging delays in immigration litigation). We also take notice of the asserted recent death of the respondent’s daughter (Respondent’s Br. at 5). Additionally, we agree with the respondent that there is a possibility that the Immigration Judge reached a conclusion in this case before all the evidence was presented (see, e.g. Tr. at 105, quoted at page 5 of the respondent’s brief), and we cannot be fully confident that the respondent has had a full opportunity for a fair hearing. Consequently, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge.

IN RE: MARCOS ALFONSO SOLIS-ENRIQUEZ
FILE: AXX XX7 212 - SEATTLE
June 5, 2007
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio Salazar, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated March 29, 2007, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his deportation proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 242B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b. The respondent filed a timely appeal from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
A hearing notice which is sent by certified mail to the alien’s last known address is sufficient to establish by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the alien received “written notice” of the deportation hearing within the meaning of section 242B(c)(1) of the Act. Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). Here, the Immigration Judge found that the Notice of Hearing (NOH) was mailed to the respondent by certified mail, which return receipt was signed by the respondent (Exh. 2).
 
An order of deportation issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242B of the Act may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed with the Immigration Judge either within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that he failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances (8 C.F.R. 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(1)) or at any time if the alien demonstrates he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own (8 C.F.R. 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(2)).
 
In his motion to reopen filed on March 16, 2007, and again on appeal, the respondent claims that he did not receive notice of his hearing and that he was never informed of the requirement to inform the Immigration Court (IC) of his address changes. He further indicates that he was represented by counsel in Los Angeles, who presumably failed to inform the respondent of his hearing.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the record establishes that the respondent was advised of the requirement to notify of address changes and that he received the NOH. Specifically, the Order to Show Cause (OSC) was personally served on the respondent on July 31, 1993 (Exh. 1). The OSC contained explicit warnings of keeping the IC apprised of his address changes, and the warning was also provided in Spanish. The record also contains a signed postal return receipt indicating that he received the NOH (Exh. 2).
 
We find no merit to the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge is not a fingerprinting expert, and thus cannot discern whether the respondent indeed received the NOH. The Immigration Judge made no fingerprinting analysis, but instead correctly noted the striking similarity between the respondent’s signature on the OSC, request to change venue and the NOH return receipt. It is the respondent’s burden to show that reopening is warranted and thus any “expert” analysis should come from him. We concur with the Immigration Judge that the signatures appear to be the respondent’s. Compare Chaidez v. Gonzales, 2007 WL 1438455 (9th Cir. 2007).
 
*2 To the extent the respondent claims ineffective assistance by former counsel, we find no merit. First, the record reflects that the respondent signed the return receipt for the NOH, so he was aware of the hearing date. Second, the December 8, 1993, in absentia order was mailed to the respondent at the same address as that contained in the NOH, with a courtesy copy mailed to his counsel, and there is no indication in the record that it was returned undelivered. Lastly, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails because the respondent has not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In that case, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned is informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where this case arises, has found the application of the noted requirements to generally be reasonable, but has held that “they need not be rigidly enforced where their purpose is fully served by other means.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). Here, however, the respondent has failed to even minimally fulfill any of the above-noted requirements. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
For the aforementioned reasons, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen these deportation proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tsz-Hai Huang, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on August 26, 2005, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely and number-barred. On May 31, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted the respondent’s unopposed motion to remand for consideration of previously unavailable evidence. The motion will be denied.
 
The only evidence cited in support of the motion is that the respondent’s first attorney, Randhir Kang, has been disbarred. However, this development does not affect our previous disposition of the respondent’s case. We have repeatedly considered and denied the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to Mr. Kang, and the fact of his disbarment does not cure the unexplained untimeliness of his prior motions or his failure to properly notify Mr. Kang of the allegations against him and his failure to provide an opportunity to respond. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). At most, it may excuse the filing of a bar complaint, but in this case, the complaint was filed. Moreover, the disbarment does not, in itself, establish that Mr. Kang provided ineffective assistance to the respondent. In fact, after investigating the bar complaint, the State Bar of California concluded that the respondent’s claim “does not warrant action,” as the Mr. Kang’s conduct “does not provide a basis for imposing discipline.” Therefore, the fact that Mr. Kang has been disbarred for conduct in other cases has little bearing on the respondent’s particular case. Finally, the respondent’s current motion does not address our finding that the respondent himself was primarily responsible for the circumstances leading to the denial of the ineffective assistance of counsel motions filed against Mr. Kang by his second attorney, Olumide Obayemi. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

The transcript of proceedings shows that the respondent, by counsel, conceded that he was inadmissible and subject to removal due to his 2005 Minnesota Controlled Substance Crime in the Third Degree-Sale convictions (Tr. at 37-39), and as he was statutorily ineligible for relief on account of these drug trafficking aggravated felony convictions (Tr. at 44-45), he waived his right to appeal (Tr. at 45). The Immigration Judge noted in his February 12, 2007, decision that the respondent had waived appeal. On March 14, 2007, the respondent nevertheless filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26).
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(G) (summary dismissal of appeal appropriate where appeal is barred based on waiver of right to appeal). The respondent on the Notice of Appeal argues that his former counsel did not adequately explain his options to him, and this led to his accepting the waiver. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001) (a party wishing to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or an appeal directly with the Board).
 
However, despite making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has complied with none of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making such a claim.¿FN1º See also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2006)(citing Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-498 (5th Cir. 2000)(upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada)). However, even if were to find the respondent had substantially complied with the Lozada requirements, the respondent must also establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his former attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640; Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605, 609 (5th Cir. 2006) (“alien’s right to due process is violated when ‘the representation afforded ¿ himº was so deficient as to impinge upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing,’ and, as a result, the alien suffered substantial prejudice.”). Specifically, the respondent’s former counsel acknowledged that the respondent’s 2005 Minnesota Controlled Substance Crime in the Third Degree-Sale convictions were aggravated felony convictions that precluded the respondent from establishing his eligibility for relief and waived appeal stating that “it’s not in ¿the respondent’sº best interest to appeal and stay in jail unnecessarily (Tr. at 45).”¿FN2º See Assaad v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 471, 475-76 (5th Cir. 2004) (former counsel’s alleged failure to file an appeal from an Immigration Judge’s denial of discretionary relief was not ineffective since alien was not entitled to relief that is available only in the exercise of the Attorney General’s discretion). There is nothing in the record, nor has the respondent provided any evidence to support his contention that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s actions so as to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

The assertion in the appellate brief that the respondent intends to comply with the procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel only if requested, see Respondent’s Mot., at p. 4, is insufficient as a reason to excuse the failure to comply with the Lozada requirements.

In this regard, we note the record reflects the respondent was convicted of the offense of Controlled Substance Crime in the Third Degree in violation of MINN. STAT. ANN. § 152.023 subdiv.1(1) (Exh. 2). Section 152.023 provides as follows:
§ 152.023 Controlled substance crime in the third degree
Subdivision 1. Sale crimes. A person is guilty of controlled substance crime in the third degree if:
(1) the person unlawfully sells one or more mixtures containing a narcotic drug;
As the language of MINN. STAT. ANN. § 152.023 subdiv.1(1) makes clear, a conviction thereunder necessarily involves “illicit trafficking” in a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)), and constitutes an aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B), thereby precluding his eligibility for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert M. Birach, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Tara L. Good
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. In a decision dated June 9, 2006, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s applications for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”) and voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, as well as protection under the Convention Against Torture. On July 11, 2006, the respondent appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision, and we rejected the appeal as untimely on July 28, 2006. On August 4, 2006, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider our July 28, 2006, decision, which we denied on September 26, 2006. On November 6, 2006, the respondent filed a “Motion to Re-open and Request for Stay of Removal.” On January 17, 2007, we denied the motion as a motion to reconsider because it was numerically barred and as a motion to reopen for lack of jurisdiction. The respondent now seeks to reopen proceedings alleging that his prior counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to file a timely appeal. The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
Even assuming that the respondent’s motion to reopen is not numerically barred under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), we nonetheless find that it is untimely. The regulations governing motions to reopen before the Board provide that a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days after the date on which a final administrative decision is rendered. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(e)(2). In this case, the final administrative decision was rendered on July 28, 2006. A timely motion to reopen was thus due on or before October 28, 2006. The respondent’s motion, however, was not filed until February 15, 2007.
 
Moreover, although the respondent alleges in his motion to reopen that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, he has failed to establish that the doctrine of equitable tolling should be applied to excuse the time limitation applicable to his motion. Specifically, we find that the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by his prior attorney’s failure to file a timely appeal. See Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857, 865-66 (6th Cir. 2006) (holding that prejudice must be established even when an alien has been denied the opportunity to appeal because of an attorney’s actions or inactions); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). In his motion, the respondent did not raise any specific claims that the Immigration Judge erred in the underlying decision. Thus, the respondent has not established that a timely appeal would have been successful. See Huicochea-Gomez v. INS, 237 F.3d 696, 699-700 (6th Cir. 2001) (finding that an alien presenting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must establish that, but for his prior attorney’s failures, he would have been entitled to remain in the United States). Moreover, we find that the respondent failed to establish that he fully complied with the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Although the respondent presented a copy of a letter he purportedly sent his prior attorney relating to the alleged ineffective assistance, this letter was sent only 1 day prior to the filing of the letter with the Board. Thus, the attorney would not have had time to respond to the allegations of ineffective assistance prior to the filing of the letter, and the respondent has not filed any subsequent documents or pleadings to indicate whether he received any response from the attorney. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. To the extent that the respondent relies in his motion to reopen on Scorteneau v. INS, 339 F.3d 407 (6th Cir. 2003), we find that it is distinguishable because it involved an alien’s failure to exercise due diligence in filing a motion to reopen after learning about his attorney’s alleged misfeasance, which is not at issue here.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Myra L. Hammond, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James R. McHenry III
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s April 26, 2006 decision denying his most recent motion to continue and ordering him removed. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a memorandum in support of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
A review of the hearing transcripts shows that the respondent was granted various continuances, for a variety of reasons, since the hearing on August 18, 2003. The most recent motion for a continuance was for the adjudication of a Labor Certification that had been pending with the State of Alabama since April 30, 2001. The respondent had declined to apply for any other form of relief (Tr. at 24).
 
The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge and based on whether good cause is shown. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; see also Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996). At the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent had had approximately 3 years, since June 2003 when the Notice to Appear was issued, to have the Labor Certification adjudicated favorably (and approximately 5 years since the Labor Certificate apparently was filed with the State of Alabama). We find that the Immigration Judge did not err in denying a continuance for the purpose of obtaining a Labor Certification which might lead to a visa. See Zafar v. Attorney General, 426 F.3d 1330 (11th Cir. 2005). The pertinent facts in the current case are similar to those in Zafar, specifically that the Labor Certification is still pending and has not been approved yet. We are not persuaded by the respondent’s argument that the facts in Zafar are distinguishable in that Zafar’s request for a continuance was denied the first time it was requested, unlike the facts in the current case where there were previously granted motions to continue. We find this not a significant, distinguishable fact. Accordingly, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s exercise of discretion.
 
To the extent that the respondent has attempted to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (see respondent’s appellate brief at 7-8), we find that he has failed to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Zachary Nightingale, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on March 1, 2007, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s December 1, 2006, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen with the Board. The motion will be denied.
 
In our March 1, 2007, decision, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his proceedings based upon the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), and that his admissions and waivers during his proceedings on October 19, 2006, without representation, were intelligent and voluntary. In particular, we concurred in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent’s 1994 conviction for assault with a deadly weapon by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury in violation of section 245(a)(1) of the California Penal Code and his 2006 conviction for vandalism in violation of section 594(b)(1) of the California Penal Code each constitutes a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude rendering the respondent removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act. As a result, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal.
 
On April 16, 2007, the respondent, through new counsel, filed the instant motion to reopen alleging that his motion before the Immigration Judge was denied and appeal before the Board dismissed due to ineffective assistance of prior counsel. See Respondent’s Motion at 9-20. According to the respondent’s motion, prior counsel’s failure to gather and introduce evidence regarding the respondent’s delusional psychotic disorder was ineffective assistance of counsel because this evidence, says the respondent, establishes that he did not knowingly or intelligently concede removability or waive his right to appeal. Id. at 9. The respondent also avers that he has shown prejudice because the Board and the Immigration Judge were not able to consider this evidence in making their respective decisions and that the evidence likely would have changed the outcome of his motion to reopen and/or appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen. Id. at 11-20. In this regard, the respondent argues that he is entitled to contest his removability and/or apply for relief from removal even if he is removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act. Id. at 20-27. Further, the respondent disputes the Immigration Judge’s October 19, 2006, decision finding him removable as an aggravated felon under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act based upon his 2006 conviction for resisting an executive officer in violation of California Penal Code section 69.1 Id. at 25-27.
 
*2 Initially, we note that the respondent has substantially complied with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), in making his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Respondent’s Brief at 10. However, we find that the respondent has failed to establish the substance of his claim against prior counsel. In particular, the respondent now claims through his current motion that his siblings notified prior counsel of his psychological problems and delusions during their November 7, 2007, appointment with prior counsel. Thus, the respondent alleges that prior counsel had notice of his condition and that he failed to pursue evidence in this regard resulting in the denial of his motion to reopen and dismissal of his appeal before the Board. In contrast to this claim, prior counsel has submitted a response to the respondent’s allegations in which he states that he was not notified of the respondent’s condition until the end of December 2006, merely 2 weeks before the respondent obtained new counsel and ordered prior counsel to cease work on his case. While we agree that had prior counsel had sufficient notice of the respondent’s delusional condition and said delusional condition contributed to the respondent’s refusal to apply for relief for which he appeared eligible, the respondent may have had a valid claim of ineffective representation, we find that the evidence presented does not sufficiently establish that prior counsel had notice of the respondent’s condition such that he was able to respond. As a result, we cannot find that the respondent has, satisfied his burden in establishing his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based upon the record before us.2
 
Despite the respondent’s failure to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, however, we find that the respondent’s motion to reopen could be granted based upon his submission of new evidence which may materially affect the outcome of his proceedings. Specifically, the respondent has presented medical evidence establishing that he suffers from a delusional psychotic disorder which prevents him from being able to decipher reality from his own paranoid delusions. This evidence suggests that the respondent likely did not have the mental capacity to act properly on his own behalf during his proceedings when he dismissed his opportunity to apply for relief from removal. In this regard, we reiterate our prior decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act which renders the respondent’s concessions regarding removability under this charge irrelevant. However, inasmuch as we find that the respondent has met the technical requirements for reopening based upon his motion, we now find it necessary to address the Immigration Judge’s additional finding of removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act based upon his conclusion that the respondent’s 2006 conviction for resisting an executive officer in violation of section 69 of the California Penal Code is a “crime of violence” and, thus, an aggravated felony rendering the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal.
 
*3 California Penal Code section 69 creates criminal liability for “¿e ºvery person who attempts, by means of any threat or violence, to deter or prevent an executive officer from performing any duty imposed upon such officer by law, or who knowingly resists, by the use of force or violence, such officer, in the performance of his duty.” Section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act defines a crime of violence as any other offense that has an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another. A conviction under section 69 has been construed to cover only threats or use of violence. See People v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 151 Cal.App.3d 893 (Cal. App. Dep’t Super. Ct. 1984); In Re Manuel G, 941 P.2d 880 (Cal. 1997). Therefore, it is a categorical “crime of violence.” As a result, the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act and ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240b(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), due to his conviction for an aggravated felony. In light of this, we find no reason to reopen the respondent’s proceedings inasmuch as he is not eligible for the relief sought and is removable as charged.
 
Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

The record reflects that the Department of Homeland Security lodged the additional charge of removability against the respondent in its opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge and that the Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b, as a result of this conviction which he found to be an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 (a)(43)(F).

In his motion, the respondent’s siblings admit that they cannot provide a copy of the agreement reached with prior counsel nor can they provide evidence establishing that they timely notified prior counsel of the respondent’s condition.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Socheat Chea, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John Holya,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 18, 2006, denying her motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for her failure to appear at the hearing on April 2, 2003. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear was issued on October 23, 2002, and personally served on the respondent on that date. Furthermore, the certificate of service on the Notice to Appear indicates that the respondent was provided oral notice in the Portuguese language of the consequences of a failure to appear, and it is signed by the respondent to acknowledge her receipt of it. See Exh. 1.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent received notice of the hearing as required by section 239(a)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(2). Written notice is considered sufficient if provided at the most recent address provided under section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act. Section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The respondent received proper notice of the hearing, as it was mailed on November 25, 2002, to the most recent address provided by the respondent, and she acknowledges that she received it.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge failed to consider all of the evidence regarding the developments that occurred regarding notice to the respondent. She avers that her husband received a change of venue and his case was transferred to Atlanta, but the respondent’s case was not. The respondent states that she was told that venue for both of their cases had been changed, but the respondent has not provided any evidence that the Immigration Court provided her with such information, nor is there any evidence in the record that the respondent ever sought a change of venue to Atlanta, Georgia. The respondent also indicates that her husband was ordered removed in absentia, but the Immigration Judge subsequently granted his motion to reopen. The respondent has not provided a copy of the motion to reopen or the Immigration Judge’s decision regarding her husband’s case. Therefore, it is unknown on what basis his proceedings were reopened by the Immigration Judge.
 
The respondent also argues that she never received a hearing notice from the Atlanta Immigration Court, which indicates the existence of a notice problem. However, the record does not reflect that the respondent ever filed a motion to change venue with the Phoenix Immigration Court requesting that her case be transferred to the Atlanta Immigration Court, nor that the Immigration Judge granted a motion to change venue. Consequently, the respondent’s case was never transferred to the Atlanta Immigration Court. Therefore, her argument regarding lack of notice from the Atlanta Immigration Court is without merit.
 
*2 Finally, the respondent asserts that subsequent to receiving the hearing notice from the Phoenix Immigration Court, she relied on information from an individual who spoke Portuguese, and who incorrectly informed her that her case was transferred to Atlanta. There is no indication that the respondent ever contacted the Phoenix Immigration Court regarding her scheduled hearing. The respondent’s reliance on an unknown individual’s incorrect advice that the respondent’s case had also been transferred to Atlanta does not constitute exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, the respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel for her failure to appear. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999) (the statute of limitations to reopen an order of deportation is equitably tolled where the alien’s late petition is the result of deceptive actions by a representative). Even if the respondent had alleged and established ineffective assistance of counsel for her failure to appear, she failed to exercise due diligence in seeking to reopen her removal proceedings. See e.g. Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002); Socop-Gonzalez, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001); Lopez v. INS, supra. She acknowledges receiving the notice of hearing, dated November 25, 2002, yet the respondent did not seek to determine the status of her removal proceedings and file a motion to reopen until July 3, 2006, over three years after she was ordered removed in absentia. The respondent has failed to establish that reopening is warranted in this matter. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Linda A. Dominguez, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)º - Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal under section 240A; voluntary departure
 
The respondent has filed a timely1 appeal of the Immigration Judge’s written decision dated October 12, 2005, denying the respondent’s applications for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), and voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), and ordering him removed to the Ivory Coast. On appeal, the respondent argues that he suffered prejudice due to ineffective assistance of counsel. During the pendency of his appeal, the respondent has submitted new evidence and has requested that his case be remanded to the Immigration Judge. The complete and well-written decision of the Immigration Judge will be affirmed, the respondent’s appeal dismissed, and the motion to remand will be denied.
 
The respondent has failed to meet the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Most importantly, he has failed to show that he suffered prejudice resulting from his prior counsel’s conduct in regard to his claim of cancellation of removal. Exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his United States citizen son has not been shown. See section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act; Matter of Monreal, 23 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2001) (hardship that is substantially beyond that ordinarily expected to result from removal from the United States).
 
Furthermore, the respondent has failed to show that he would have qualified for voluntary departure, and thus failed to show prejudice in that regard as well. Specifically, contrary to the respondent’s argument on his Notice of Appeal, the record before us does not contain a complete copy of a valid passport issued in the respondent’s name, and he has not provided a copy of such on appeal. Thus he has failed to show that he had the means to depart the United States, and he thus failed to qualify for voluntary departure. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(2). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joy A. Merriman,
Of Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated September 21, 2006, the Immigration Judge denied the respondents’ motion to reopen their removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). The respondents filed a timely appeal from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record contains Forms I-826, Notice of Rights and Request for Disposition, for each of the respondents, in which they request a hearing before the Immigration Court, and which are also signed by each respondent on June 11, 2002. The record contains Forms I-213, Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien, dated June 11, 2002, which reflects the respondents addresses as: 50 Wyoming Street, Buffalo, NY 14215. The Forms I-862, Notices to Appear (NTA) were mailed to the respondents at the above address on June 19, 2002, which ordered the respondents to appear at a removal hearing on August 21, 2002. The respondents failed to appear and an in absentia removal order was entered on that date.
 
In their August 15, 2006, motion to reopen, the respondents do not allege that they did not receive notice of their hearing. Instead, they aver that since they were attempting to immigrate to Canada, they were advised by the Red Cross not to appear at their hearing, and so they left prior to the removal hearing. On appeal, they contend that Viva Le Casa advised them to depart to Canada, and they indicate that they want their removal orders “removed” because they are now Canadian residents and they want to travel to the United States.
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 723 (BIA 1999). The term “exceptional circumstances” is defined by the Act as “exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
*2 A review of the record reflects that the Immigration Judge’s order of removal was entered in absentia on August 21, 2002. There is no indication in the record that the respondents advised the Immigration Judge that they had departed the United States. The respondents failed to file their motion to reopen within 180 days after issuance of the order of removal, as is required under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. To the extent they allege ineffective assistance of counsel (insofar as they were purportedly advised not to appear at their hearing), they have failed to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and re-affirmed in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). See also Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46 (2d Cir. 2005) (finding that the failure to comply with the Lozada requirements constitutes forfeiture of the ineffective assistance claim). Moreover, they have failed to show that they have been diligent since they purportedly discovered their removal orders in 2004.1 See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006)(court concluded that aliens had demonstrated that their counsel was ineffective in informing them that they did not need to appear at a hearing, but they had not met their burden of showing why they had not been diligent). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

On appeal, the respondents maintain that it was only when their attorney in Canada reviewed their documents in 2004, that they realized they had a court date in August 2002. This claim is nonsensical, because if they had documents in their possession which reflected the 2002 hearing date, they obviously received notice of their hearing or the removal order. Consequently, they should have been aware of their hearing. This statement is also inconsistent with their other averment that they were advised by the Red Cross (or Viva Le Casa) not to appear at their hearing.

May 17, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Murray D. Hilts, Esquire
*1 This case is before us on remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Pursuant to a joint motion to remand, in its November 14, 2006, unpublished decision, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the Board. Upon further consideration, the Board again declines to reopen proceedings in this case.
 
The respondent is from Mexico. On October 20, 1993, in California, he was convicted of sale/transportation/offer to sell heroin. On May 22, 2001, the respondent was convicted of possession of heroin in California. On January 10, 2002, an Immigration Judge found that the respondent had been convicted of an aggravated felony and was ineligible for relief from removal. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal as untimely on August 29, 2003.
 
On October 14, 2005, the Board issued an order which found that the respondent had not submitted a proper motion to reopen on June 14, 2005, as it contained no legal argument, but rather had presented several “Attachments”, including the respondent’s affidavit.
 
On January 20, 2006, the Board considered a reconsideration motion filed by the respondent. The Board reconsidered the reasons for the earlier denial of the motion to reopen, based on the explanation that the respondent’s attorney’s office made a clerical error in omitting the actual motion to reopen. Upon reconsideration, however, the motion to reopen was again denied. The Board found that, despite blaming former counsel for filing an untimely appeal, the respondent failed to show diligence in bringing his claims.
 
In any event, the Board found, the respondent failed to show prejudice resulting from his attorney’s actions. Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1189 (9th Cir. 2004); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The Board noted that the Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for relief from removal based on his conviction of an aggravated felony. The motion to reopen argued that the respondent was eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) concerning the 1993 conviction, which would then allow him to pursue cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, at pp. 10-12).
 
The Board’s January 20, 2006, decision found that this contention was incorrect. The United States Supreme Court held that the restrictions on section 212(c) relief do not apply retroactively to aliens who pled guilty to offenses prior to April 24, 1996. See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). The respondent was found to have committed an aggravated felony based on his 2001 conviction for possession of heroin, after a previous conviction, and relief under 212(c) of the Act was therefore unavailable even under that court ruling.
 
*2 The joint motion to remand, approved by the Ninth Circuit, states that the Board is to “consider¿º whether, in connection with a proper analysis of a controlled substance violation precluding relief, including but not limited to consideration of properly noticed documents, ¿the respondentº has shown prejudice sufficient to support ¿the respondent’sº claim of ineffective assistance of counsel” (case citations omitted).
 
As the Board noted in its January 20, 2006, decision, the respondent was convicted in 2001 for possession of heroin, after a previous conviction. The respondent’s 2001 conviction for possession of heroin was preceded by the 1993 heroin conviction, so the 2001 heroin possession conviction is an aggravated felony under federal law. See 21 U.S.C. § 844(a); Lopez v. Gonzales, __ U.S. __, 127 S.Ct. 625 (U.S. 2006). The 2001 crime is not subject to a section 212(c) waiver under INS v. St. Cyr, supra, as it was committed long after April 24, 1996. Moreover, as the respondent was convicted of the aggravated felony in 2001, he is not eligible for cancellation of removal. See section 240A(a) of the Act.
 
Additionally, even if a section 212(c) waiver was potentially available concerning the 1993 narcotics conviction, it would not eliminate the existence of that conviction and its ability to render the 2001 conviction an aggravated felony. See Becker v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 1000, 1003-04 (9th Cir. 2007) (“… the grant of section 212(c) relief merely waives the finding of deportability rather than the basis of the deportability itself. Therefore, the crimes alleged to be grounds for deportability do not disappear from the alien’s record for immigration purposes”). Therefore, as the Board stated in its January 20, 2006, decision, the respondent is ineligible for relief under section 212(c) of the Act, as well as section 240A(a) of the Act, and the respondent has not shown prejudice regarding alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
ORDER: As set out in the joint remand motion approved by the Ninth Circuit on November 14, 2006, we have given further consideration to the respondent’s motion to reopen, and find that it should again be denied. The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Arthur A. Campomanes, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s September 6, 2005, decision denying the respondent’s counsel’s request for a continuance for filing of a new I-130 visa petition, and ordering the respondent removed to the Philippines. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s counsel’s request for a continuance after determining that the respondent had abandoned a visa petition that had been filed on her behalf and that she did not have, at the time of the hearing, an approved, or even pending, visa petition (I.J. at 2).1 One of the pre-requisites to qualify for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), is that the alien demonstrate that an immigrant visa is immediately available to him or her at the time that the application is filed. See Matter of Garcia, 16 I&N Dec. 653, 654 (BIA 1978). In the present case, it is an established, undisputed fact that, at the time of the hearing, no immigrant visa was immediately available to the respondent, as there was no approved, or even pending, visa petition. The respondent has merely argued, unpersuasively, that the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion for continuance was erroneous and constituted a due process violation. See Respondent’s Brief at 3-5. We disagree. An Immigration Judge, in his or her discretion, may grant a motion for a continuance for good cause shown. Good cause is not demonstrated by requesting a continuance to await the results of a collateral event, which may occur at some indefinite time in the future, and the outcome of which may or may not be favorable to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987). We find that the Immigration Judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the respondent’s motion for a continuance in this case because, at the time of the hearing, the respondent was statutorily ineligible to adjust status.
 
This Board finds puzzling, as well as troublesome, the respondent’s unfounded suggestion, through counsel, of bias and/or misconduct by the Immigration Judge, claiming that the Immigration Judge “seemed more interested in finding a justification to deport her rather than finding out the facts in her situation and giving her an opportunity to seek an available relief.” See Respondent’s Brief at 4. We have found no evidence in the record of any bias or misconduct by the Immigration Judge. This Board also notes that the respondent has suggested, through counsel, that she received ineffective assistance from her prior counsel, who allegedly failed to appeal the October 2001 denial of a visa application that was reportedly filed on her behalf by her husband. See Notice of Appeal, attachment; Tr. at 15-16, 24; see also Respondent’s Brief, Exh. B. The respondent, however, has failed to set forth a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because she has not met the minimum requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), petition for review denied, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2007). The respondent also seems to have implied, through counsel, that the burden to prove ineffective assistance of counsel is on the government. See Respondent’s Brief at 4. A simple reading of Lozada reveals that that is not the case. We also find unpersuasive the respondent’s unsupported and unconvincing argument on appeal that the Immigration Judge “erred in compelling the respondent to be a witness against herself on … fraud allegations.” See Respondent’s Brief at 5.
 
*2 Finally, this Board acknowledges the argument and evidence submitted by the respondent on appeal suggesting that a visa application, purportedly filed by the respondent’s current husband after the hearing in this case, has already been approved. See Respondent’s Brief at 5, and its Exhs. B and D. Even if actual proof of the approval of a visa petition had been submitted, the dismissal of this appeal would nevertheless stand, as the respondent’s appeal is limited to the question of whether the Immigration Judge’s denial of a motion for a continuance was appropriate. Any subsequent filing and approval of a visa petition of which the respondent is the beneficiary is clearly irrelevant for purposes of this appeal.2 Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

At the hearing, the Department of Homeland Security informed the Court that the respondent’s first husband, Peter Butler, had filed a visa petition on behalf of the respondent, but that that petition was denied by the government on May 25, 2000. See Tr. at 2. The respondent’s counsel confirmed this fact, as well as the fact that a second visa petition, filed by the respondent’s current husband, Gilbert Geronimo, had been denied as well, in October 2001. See Tr. at 12-13. The respondent’s counsel also acknowledged at the hearing that no further action had been taken since the October 2001 denial, but that Mr. Geronimo intended to file a new visa petition on behalf of the respondent. See Tr. at 13, 16.

The present dismissal of the respondent’s appeal does not preclude her from filing an application to adjust status in the future, provided she has evidence of the alleged approval of a visa petition filed on her behalf.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brian Patrick Conry, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Tammy L. Fitting
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on September 22, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s May 6, 2005, decision. The Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for relief under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), because the respondent’s conviction for second degree sexual abuse by a jury trial does not fall within the ambit of the Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001); and the respondent’s conviction for an offense constituting an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(A), has no statutory counterpart in the grounds of inadmissibility under section 212(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a).
 
On March 28, 2007, the respondent filed the instant untimely motion to reopen based on an ineffective assistance claim against his prior attorney, Ms. Erin Hall. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (with certain exceptions not relevant here, a motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal). A final order was entered in this case on September 22, 2005.
 
Because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether this case warrants equitable tolling. The Ninth Circuit has held that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
Although the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), he has failed to establish that his case was prejudiced as a result of Ms. Hall’s conduct. Nor is it clear that Ms. Hall’s assistance was ineffective.
 
We recognize that the respondent’s motion is supported by new evidence which was not submitted to the Immigration Judge, namely, a transcript of the respondent’s April 15, 1989, sentencing proceeding in the Circuit Court of the County of Multnomah, in Portland Oregon. The respondent submits this document to establish that although he was convicted at trial, he relied on the availability of 212(c) relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(h) (aliens are not eligible to apply for 212(c) relief with respect to convictions entered after trial). However, the proffered evidence would not necessarily alter the result in this case. To date, in the Ninth Circuit, wherein this case arises, an alien who is convicted at trial is not eligible for section 212(c) relief. See Armendariz-Montoya v. Sonchik, 291 F.3d 1116, 1121-22 (9th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 902 (2003). Although Ms. Hall did not submit this transcript to the Immigration Judge, she submitted a memorandum of law arguing the respondent’s 212(c) eligibility even though he was convicted at trial.
 
*2 Even if the respondent could establish his 212(c) eligibility despite the fact that he was convicted at trial, he is ineligible for a 212(c) waiver because his aggravated felony conviction lacks a comparable ground of inadmissibility. See Matter of Blake, 23 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 2005). In his motion, the respondent asserts that Ms. Hall should have argued that the facts of his case are different from those in Matter of Blake, supra. See Respondent’s Motion, Attachment ER-8 (Bar Complaint to the Washington State Bar). The respondent also asserts that Ms. Hall should have argued that Blake was wrongly decided. See Respondent’s Motion, Attachment ER-5 at 39-44 (Respondent’s Brief filed with the Ninth Circuit). Ms. Hall’s failure to raise these particular arguments did not prejudice the respondent’s case. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004) (counsel’s actions must have rendered the proceedings fundamentally unfair such that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case). Under the principles enunciated in Matter of Blake, supra, and Matter of Brieva, 23 I&N Dec. 766 (BIA 2005), the respondent’s aggravated felony conviction lacks a comparable ground of inadmissibility, and he is ineligible for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Act. We find no reason to disturb those decisions.
 
Accordingly, we find that the respondent has failed to present a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that warrants equitable tolling of the time limits on motions to reopen. The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul A. Schelly, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeffrey D. Clark,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal is dismissed. The respondent appealed from the January 10, 2007, oral decision of the Immigration Judge, which found him removable; determined that he did not establish eligibility for cancellation of removal, voluntary departure, or any other relief from removal; and ordered him removed from the United States to Mexico. A reply brief was submitted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) on March 30, 2007.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusions regarding the respondent’s removability and ineligibility for relief. The Immigration Judge properly found the respondent removable as charged, pursuant to sections 212(a)(6)(A)(i), 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(II), and 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(II), and 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). The record reflects that the respondent was convicted on May 31, 1996, of possession for sale of a controlled substance, namely cocaine, under California law. We note that this conviction is for a drug trafficking offense that is both an aggravated felony and a particularly serious crime. See Matter of Y-L-, A-G-, and R-S-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 270 (A.G. 2002). The respondent stated that he did not have a fear of persecution or torture from governmental authorities in his native country of Mexico (Tr. at 10).
 
On appeal, the respondent suggests that he is eligible for cancellation of removal, asserting that he arrived in the United States in 1992 rather than the April 2004 date listed on the Notice to Appear. Consistent with the DHS’s appellate position, the respondent is ineligible for both cancellation of removal and voluntary departure due to his aggravated felony conviction, regardless of whether he arrived in this country in 1992 or 2004. See sections 240A(b)(1)(C) and 240B(b)(1)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(b)(1)(C) and 1229c(b)(1)(C).
 
Finally, the respondent alleges on the Notice of Appeal (“NTA”) that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent indicates that he himself filed the NTA after his attorney did not do so. With respect to this ineffective assistance claim, which is in remand posture, we note that the respondent has not satisfied any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F. 2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent has not forwarded an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement between himself and his attorney; has not shown that the attorney whose competence is being impugned has been informed of the respondent’s allegations against him and has been given an opportunity to respond; and has not communicated whether he has filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities against the attorney. See also Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding that notification to counsel is “required” for an ineffective assistance claim and that a complaint letter to the California State Bar with the notation “cc” to opposing counsel does not satisfy the requirement). We also do not find that a remand is warranted in light of Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that rigid adherence to the Lozada requirements is not always required, especially when the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance). We observe that, even assuming the respondent’s Lozada compliance, he has not established that he is eligible for any relief from removal. To the extent that the respondent contends that his removal hearing was unfair, we find that he has not demonstrated any error by the Immigration Judge in conducting the hearing. We also find that the respondent has not demonstrated any resultant prejudice such as would constitute a due process violation. See Almaghzar v. Gonzales, 450 F.3d 415 (9th Cir. 2006).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carol H. Sloss, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen and reconsider our decision dated February 8, 2007. Our prior decision summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal for failure to provide specific reasons in his Notice Of Appeal for challenging the Immigration Court’s decision, and failure to submit a separate brief or statement in support of the appeal when he checked a box on the Notice Of Appeal indicating his intent to do so. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(A) and (E). The respondent’s motion to reopen is based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Initially, we find that the respondent has failed to comply with any of the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that are set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The record shows that the respondent’s appeal brief was due on September 21, 2006. On September 19, 2006, former counsel attempted to file a motion to withdraw as the respondent’s representative, but the motion was denied because former counsel failed to provide the respondent’s last known address.1 The respondent’s current motion states that former counsel attempted to withdraw as his representative “because counsel had been continually unable to contact Respondent for several months” (Motion at 3). On October 11, 2006, former counsel filed a new Entry of Appearance As Attorney and requested an extension of time to file an appeal brief. The briefing extension request was denied as untimely because it was filed after the September 21, 2006, filing deadline originally set by the Board. An appeal brief filed by former counsel on November 13, 2006, was also rejected as untimely.
 
The facts presented in the respondent’s motion do not reflect that former counsel was negligent or otherwise ineffective in representing the respondent. According to the chronology outlined in the respondent’s motion, former counsel was unable to contact the respondent despite repeated efforts to do so, and finally attempted to withdraw as the respondent’s representative. The respondent has not identified any action or inaction of former counsel that caused the rejection of his untimely brief and the dismissal of his appeal. We can only conclude that the dismissal of the respondent’s appeal resulted solely from the respondent’s own failure to maintain communication and assist his former attorney with the preparation of his appeal. Under the circumstances, the respondent has not shown that any prejudice resulted from the representation of his former counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 The respondent’s motion is defective, insofar as it requests reconsideration of our prior order, because it fails to identify any legal or factual errors in our previous decision that warrant reconsideration. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gregory Olive, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; reissuance of Board decision; stay of deportation
 
This case was last before us on November 1, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s February 23, 2006, decision denying the respondent’s motion to terminate removal proceedings against him. On February 15, 2007, the respondent filed this untimely motion to reopen, including a request to stay his deportation, based on his former counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance in representing him at the administrative level. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (2006). In the alternative, the respondent moves for a reissuance of this Board’s prior decision due to his former counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance in failing to timely file a petition for review before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Department of Homeland Security has filed no opposition or other response to this motion, and the motion is deemed unopposed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The motion will be granted in part, and denied in part.
 
The respondent concedes that his motion to reopen is untimely; however, he asserts that equitable tolling applies based on the ineffective assistance he received from his former counsel, Robert F. Jacobs. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and upheld in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). We surmise that the respondent argues he should be excused from full compliance with the requirements for presenting an ineffective assistance claim under Lozada because the ineffective assistance is clear on the face of the record. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003) (involving former counsel who failed to file a timely brief before the Board). We disagree. Although the respondent has complied with the first two Lozada requirements, he has not complied with the third requirement, to wit, indicating that a bar complaint has been filed against Mr. Jacobs. “This requirement ensures a certain level of seriousness in the assertion of such charges and ‘highlights the standards which should be expected of attorneys who represent persons in immigration proceedings.”’ Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, supra, at 825 (quoting Lozada, supra, at 639). Ordinarily, failure to comply with all of the Lozada requirements can be fatal to an alien’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir.2000) (explaining that rigid compliance is not always necessary). We consider this third requirement crucial in discerning a legitimate claim of ineffective assistance from the numerous, baseless claims of ineffective assistance filed with the Board. In Rojas-Garcia, the court found that the claim for ineffective assistance was not fatal because: (1) the ineffective assistance was obvious from the face of the record; and (2) the alien had substantially complied with Lozada since his former counsel self-reported his defective representation to the bar. Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, supra, at 825-26. Here, the respondent has not met either of these factors because there is no indication of a bar complaint either by the respondent or Mr. Jacobs, and there is no patent ineffective assistance of counsel at the administrative level.1 Therefore, his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel in support of the motion to reopen must fail.
 
*2 We find that even if the respondent had complied with Lozada, he has not established that Mr. Jacobs’ representation at the administrative level was ineffective. The respondent contends that Mr. Jacobs provided ineffective assistance at the administrative level when he did not object to the admission of the smugglee’s statements, and did not submit affidavits or witness testimony from the respondent’s family members to corroborate his story. As evidenced by Mr. Jacobs’ response to questions posed by the respondent’s current counsel, he made a tactical decision to not object to the smugglee’s statements hoping to highlight both internal and external inconsistencies. See Attachment to Motion “February 14, 2007 Letter from Mr. Jacobs.” Although there were inconsistences, as the Immigration Judge’s and our prior decision confirmed, the unmistakable similarities between the smugglee’s and the respondent’s statements regarding the essential elements of the smuggling scheme discredited the respondent’s version of the events at the hearing. Moreover, the Immigration Judge explained how the respondent’s own testimony was replete with implausibilities, inconsistencies, and thereby not credible (I.J. at 2-12; compare Tr. at 10 (sole purpose was to pick up son-in-law’s mother) with Tr. at 19-20 (purpose of trip was to also pick up smugglee and stating he was told to pick up the smugglee 8 days prior to the date he picked her up) with Exh. 2 (respondent’s Record of Sworn Statement). Subsequent dissatisfaction with a strategic decision of counsel is not grounds to reopen. See Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931 (9th Cir. 1986); Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (absent a showing of egregious circumstances, a tactical decision by an attorney is binding on the alien). Regarding the failure to submit affidavits from family members, Mr. Jacobs attempted to obtain such affidavits, including witness testimony, and advised the respondent of their necessity. See “February 14, 2007 Letter from Mr. Jacobs.” In addition, Mr. Jacobs advised the respondent that he should obtain proof such as telephone records, the flight itinerary of his son-in-law’s mother, declarations, and a doctor’s letter stating the mother was too ill to travel that day. Id. The respondent’s failure to obtain any of this evidence or produce any witnesses on his behalf is not attributable to Mr. Jacobs. Although the respondent has submitted documents purporting to be affidavits with this motion, he has not shown how these were unobtainable at the time of his merits hearing; in addition, the respondent has not provided any new evidence which would corroborate even one version of his story. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). ‘Therefore, the respondent has not shown patent or latent ineffective assistance by Mr. Jacobs in his representation at the administrative level, and there exists no good cause to reopen these proceedings.
 
*3 We now turn to the respondent’s motion to reissue our prior decision based on Mr. Jacobs’ ineffective assistance in failing to file a timely petition for review in the Ninth Circuit. We emphasize that any such ineffective assistance is based on Mr. Jacobs’ representation before the Ninth Circuit, and does not implicate any action by the Immigration Judge or the Board. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(b), (c). Nonetheless; the Ninth Circuit has found that such ineffective assistance necessitates that the Board reissue a decision to allow an alien to then timely file an appeal in that forum. See Dearinger ex. rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1045-46 (9th Cir. 2000) (upholding a district court decision ordering the Board to reissue its decision where counsel filed a petition for review 1 day late). Although the respondent has not complied with Lozada to bring an ineffective assistance claim within the scope of the Board’s authority, based on the Dearinger holding and the appellate court’s de novo review of such claims, we find that Mr. Jacobs’ failure to file a petition for review would constitute ineffective assistance before the Ninth Circuit, thereby raising a rebuttable presumption of prejudice. See Dearinger ex. rel. Volkova v. Reno, supra, at 1045. Accordingly, we will grant the motion to reissue.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied, and the request for stay of deportation is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reissue is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated November 1, 2006, is hereby reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.

Mr. Jacobs’ failure to file a petition for review in the Ninth Circuit has no bearing on the analysis of his representation at the administrative level. However, we will revisit such failure in our discussion of the respondent’s motion to reissue our prior decision.

IN RE: HANI KAZBAR
File: AXX XX4 222 - Los Angeles
April 25, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Aria Shariati, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(G)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(G)(ii)º - Failed to fulfill marital agreement (withdrawn)
Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)º - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status (withdrawn)
 
 
Lodged: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Remand; adjustment of status
 
In a decision dated November 16, 2005, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for a continuance in order to continue processing an application for adjustment of status; she ordered the respondent removed to Syria. The Immigration Judge had previously granted the respondent numerous continuances in order to await processing of a labor certification required in order to qualify for adjustment of status, but after nearly 3 years had passed, she declined to hold the case in abeyance any longer. The respondent claims that the Immigration Judge made procedural and substantive errors and requests a remand which will be granted. His request for oral argument is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7) (2006).
 
The respondent raises the question of which charging document applies to his case, although for reasons relating to his eligibility for asylum and not to challenge his removability (Respondent’s Br. at 25-27; see also Respondent’s Br. at 28 (arguing he was denied a fair hearing)). The respondent was originally charged under sections 237(a)(1)(G)(ii) and 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(1)(G)(ii), 1227(a)(1)(C)(i), although these charges were withdrawn by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and substituted with a charge under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (Tr. at 2; see Exhs. 1 & 2). The respondent later conceded to removability — we presume — under the section 212 charge (Tr. at 6). However, the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 16, 2005, lists only the section 237 charges in the heading and appears to have found the respondent removable under the section 237 charges; the Immigration Judge notes that exhibit 2 — the lodged 212 charge — was not pled to (I.J. at 2; see Tr. at 32). We find it necessary to remand proceedings in order to obtain a more accurate picture of the respondent’s removability. As the respondent correctly points out, which charging document is sustained affects the respondent’s eligibility for relief, although we note that his failure to file an asylum application belies his claim that he was prevented from filing one due to confusion in the charging documents about when he arrived here. At any rate, he is correct that if he conceded the charges in the original Notice to Appear, he would be time-barred from applying for asylum; if he conceded to the lodged charge, he would be ineligible for adjustment of status. See Eligibility of Arriving Aliens in Removal Proceedings to Apply for Adjustment of Status and Jurisdiction to Adjudicate Applications for Adjustment of Status, 71 Fed. Reg. 27,585-592 (May 12, 2006). Furthermore, he cannot have conceded to both of the charging documents as they present different facts about when the respondent arrived and whether he was admitted.
 
*2 The issue of removability is also related to the respondent’s other claims alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, various procedural due process claims, and his claim that the Immigration Judge erred in finding him ineligible for adjustment of status. First, with regard to the respondent’s claim that he was not adequately represented by his three previous attorneys, all apparently from the same law firm, we can find no basis to remand. We note that the respondent has submitted a supplemental filing which indicates that he has complied with most of the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).1
 
However, we are not able to determine that he suffered prejudice by his attorneys’ actions. He alleges that his former attorneys never investigated the manner in which the respondent was arrested and that, due to the illegality of the arrest, all evidence obtained should be have suppressed (Respondent’s Br. at 21-22). He also argues that former counsel never presented proper evidence of the respondent’s eligibility for adjustment of status (Respondent’s Br. at 22-24). The respondent does not specify what evidence should have been suppressed and it is unclear how his arrest by United States Marshals necessarily affects his removability. However, to the extent he wishes to revisit this issue, he may state his claim before the Immigration Judge on remand and can revisit the issue of eligibility for relief as well. See Matter of Patel, 16 I&N Dec. 600, 601 (BIA 1978) (noting that with certain exceptions, the remand of a case by this Board is effective for not only the stated purpose of the remand, but also for consideration of any and all matters which the Immigration Judge deems appropriate). We decline, however, at this time to find that he was subjected to ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has failed to establish that his arrest was illegal or that the manner in which he was arrested provided a basis for terminating proceedings. With regard to his attorneys’ attempt to aid the respondent in gaining relief from removal, there was no approved labor certification which was necessary for the respondent to adjust his status based on an employment-related visa petition. The respondent has failed to establish that his former counsels’ acts prejudiced him.
 
We also decline to find error in the Immigration Judge’s decision not to grant yet another continuance, although, again, our remand, in effect, provides the respondent with a continued proceeding and, therefore, with the result he seeks. As we have stated before, granting a motion for a continuance is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, and her decision denying such a motion will not be reversed on appeal unless the alien establishes, by a full and specific articulation of the particular facts involved or evidence which he would have presented, that the denial caused him actual prejudice and harm, and materially affected the outcome of his case. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). Here, the respondent had already been granted several continuances and there remained no evidence that the respondent was eligible for any relief other than voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge properly denied the request for what amounted to an indefinite request to continue proceedings.
 
*3 We note the respondent’s argument that a continuance was warranted in order to allow his current attorney, who was, at the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision, new to the case, an opportunity to prepare himself and become familiar with the record of proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 27-28; Tr. at 26). Relatedly, he asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in applying San Francisco local operating rules (the Immigration Judge hailed from that area) while sitting in the Los Angeles immigration court (Respondent’s Br. at 31-32). According to the respondent, previous counsel did not formally withdraw from representing him and should have been present at the hearing; the Immigration Judge’s decision without their presence allegedly violated procedural due process (Respondent’s Br. at 32; see Tr. at 30). We find any error to be harmless because Los Angeles local operating procedures (like the San Francisco rules) specifically state that substitution of counsel is allowed where the request is made orally or in writing by the attorney to be substituted. This was done (Exh. 16).
 
ORDER: The record of proceedings is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings to clarify the charges of removability and to allow the respondent to apply for any relief for which he may be eligible.

Matter of Lozada requires that a motion claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must provide evidence (1) setting forth in detail the agreement entered into between client and counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion to remand or reopen reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. While the respondent has provided evidence that complied with the first and third requirements, we are unable to determine whether he has informed former counsel of the allegations.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mathew L. Millen, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F..R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated October 26, 2006. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent was ordered removed from the United States because she failed to appear for a hearing on May 16, 2006. She filed a motion to reopen, but the Immigration Judge denied the request on July 28, 2006. That decision was appealed to the Board, but it was dismissed on October 26, 2006. The respondent filed the instant motion to reopen on March 21, 2007. Therein, the respondent argues that these proceedings should be reopened based on “exceptional circumstances” causing her failure to appear. According to the respondent, she was the victim of negligence by her prior counsel who did not adequately advise her of the obligation to appear for her hearing on May 16, 2006. See also Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 2007 WL 1113912 (5th Cir. April 16, 2007).
 
The instant motion to reopen was filed with the Board more than 90 days after the date in which the final administrative decision by the Board was rendered on October 26, 2006. It is therefore untimely and is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). We have also determined that the exceptions to these filing requirements set forth in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3) are inapplicable. In addition, 8 C.F.R. §1003.23(b)(4)(ii) provides that an alien may file only one motion to seek reopening of an order of removal entered in absentia.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the Board should equitably toll the time and number requirements for reopening an order of removal entered in absentia based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383 (5th Cir. 2001); Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497 (5th Cir. 2000). In the instant case, the respondent indicates in her declaration that she was aware of her hearing. She states that she contacted her former attorney who told her that it should be okay if he represented her at the May 16, 2006, hearing by telephone. The respondent further indicates that former counsel did not instruct her to appear for the hearing, and implies that he may have even told her to not appear. See Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzales, 2007 WL 1113912 (5th Cir. April 16, 2007). Even if such conduct was negligent, we note that the respondent’s current attorney represented her on appeal with the Board and filed a brief on her behalf. Current counsel should therefore have been familiar with the facts of the respondent’s case at the time, and clearly had the opportunity to discuss the case with the respondent within 90 days of the Board’s prior decision. Under these circumstances, we do not find it appropriate io equitably toll the 90-day period for seeking reopening even if we had the authority to do so. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN RE Y-L-, RESPONDENT
Decided April 25, 2007
**1 *151 (1) In determining that an application for asylum is frivolous, the Immigration Judge must address the question of frivolousness separately and make specific findings that the applicant deliberately fabricated material elements of the asylum claim.

FOR RESPONDENT:
Khagendra Gharti-Chhetry, Esquire,
New York, New York
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY:
Virna A. Wright,
Assistant Chief Counsel
BEFORE: Board Panel: HURWITZ, Acting Vice Chairman; HOLMES and MILLER, Board Members.
HURWITZ, Acting Vice Chairman:
In a decision dated January 22, 2004, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable on his own admissions and denied his applications for asylum, withholding of removal under section 241(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b) (2000), and protection under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted and opened for signature Dec. 10, 1984, G.A. Res. 39/46, 39 U.N. GAOR Supp. No. 51, at 197, U.N. Doc. A/RES/39/708 (1984) (entered into force June 26, 1987; for the United States Apr. 18, 1988) (“Convention Against Torture”). On December 4, 2004, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision without opinion, and the respondent subsequently filed a petition for review. On July 11, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit remanded this case with a request that we further consider the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent’s asylum application was frivolous, and that we formulate standards for deciding when an asylum application may be found to be *152 frivolous. Liu v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 455 F.3d 106 (2d Cir. 2006). Upon further consideration, the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s finding that his asylum application was frivolous will be sustained, and that part of our decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s ruling in that regard will be vacated.
  
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of the People’s Republic of China who entered the United States in January 2002 without proper documents. The respondent was placed in removal proceedings and filed his original Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal (Form I-589) in Immigration Court in August 2002. The claim was based principally on problems related to his wife’s practice of Falun Gong. A statement included with the original asylum application indicated that he and his wife had two children, a son born on September 24, 1989, and a daughter born on May 2, 1991. In regard to the second child, the statement provided:
**2 According to the family planning policy, we were not allowed to have a second child. However, my wife and I believe[d] that there would not be any social security and retirement system to assure peasants like us. Therefore we had a second child. We hid here and there to avoid being captured by government officials. In order to give birth to my daughter, Liu Yin Fang, we hid here and there and led a stressful life.
 
In support of his original application for asylum, the respondent provided copies of his children’s birth certificates, each of which identified the respondent as the father and the respondent’s wife as the mother. He also submitted a copy of a Household Registration Booklet listing himself, his wife, and his son and daughter as members of the household.
 
Nearly a year after filing the original asylum application, the respondent retained new counsel and filed an amended application with a supporting statement providing the following account of events. After their son’s birth on September 24, 1989, his wife became pregnant again in August 1990. She avoided the quarterly check-ups with family planning officials because the second pregnancy violated the family planning laws. On April 20, 1991, four family planning officials came to their home and forcibly took his wife for an abortion. On May 8, 1991, the respondent’s sister-in-law found an abandoned female infant alongside a road in the village. The respondent and his wife informally adopted the infant as their own. In December 1996, the family planning office learned of the second child and fined the respondent and his wife for an illegal adoption. The pressures of these events affected his wife’s health and caused her to turn to the practice of Falun Gong for relief.
 
The remainder of the statement tracks the Falun Gong aspects of the claim contained in the original application and supporting statement. In support of *153 his amended asylum application, the respondent submitted an abortion certificate, a fine receipt, and statements from his wife and the sister-in-law who found the infant.
 
At a hearing before the Immigration Judge, the respondent testified concerning his request for asylum and answered questions from his attorney, the Government attorney, and the Immigration Judge. In regard to his wife’s second pregnancy, he testified that his wife remained at home undetected for almost the entire term of her pregnancy until the four family planning officials came to their home and forcibly took her for an abortion.
 
After the hearing, the Immigration Judge issued an oral decision denying the respondent’s requests for relief from removal and ordering him removed to the People’s Republic of China. In her decision, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not presented a credible claim for asylum or withholding of removal. She also found that the respondent had submitted a frivolous application for asylum in that he had deliberately fabricated the account of the abortion and the illegal adoption in his amended asylum application in order to obtain immigration benefits in the United States.
 
**3 The respondent appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision. In regard to the frivolousness finding, the respondent stated in his notice of appeal that he did not mention his wife’s abortion in the original application for asylum because “he did not meet the attorney and he was not interviewed by the attorney before filing the original I-589” and “[t]he secretary missed mention [ing] his wife’s abortion in his original I-589.” Other than the conclusory statement that the determination was “arbitrary and capricious,” and that there was no confirmation from the consulate that documents submitted by the respondent were fraudulent, the respondent’s 8-page brief did not address the Immigration Judge’s frivolousness finding. We affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision without opinion.
 
The respondent then petitioned the Second Circuit for review, challenging both the Immigration Judge’s adverse credibility determination and her frivolousness finding. The Second Circuit concluded that “substantial evidence support[ed] the credibility ruling against [the respondent]” but remanded the frivolousness finding to give the Board “an opportunity, in the first instance, to formulate standards for deciding when an asylum seeker’s application may be deemed frivolous.” Liu v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, supra, at 108.
  
II. STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
 
In 1996, Congress amended the immigration law to discourage the filing of frivolous asylum applications. Section 208(d)(4)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(d)(4)(A) (2000), requires the Attorney General to advise an alien applying for asylum, at the time of filing an application, of the consequences *154 of knowingly filing a frivolous application. See also 8 C.F.R. § 1240.11(c)(1)(iii) (2006). Those consequences are stated in section 208(d)(6) of the Act, which provides as follows:
If the Attorney General determines that an alien has knowingly made a frivolous application for asylum and the alien has received the notice under paragraph (4)(A), the alien shall be permanently ineligible for any benefits under this Act, effective as of the date of a final determination on such application.
 
 
The regulation that governs the determination whether an asylum application is frivolous provides:
For applications filed on or after April 1, 1997, an applicant is subject to the provisions of section 208(d)(6) of the Act only if a final order by an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals specifically finds that the alien knowingly filed a frivolous asylum application. For purposes of this section, an asylum application is frivolous if any of its material elements is deliberately fabricated. Such finding shall only be made if the immigration judge or the Board is satisfied that the applicant, during the course of the proceedings, has had sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim. For purposes of this section, a finding that an alien filed a frivolous asylum application shall not preclude the alien from seeking withholding of removal.
 
**4 8 C.F.R. § 1208.20 (2006).
 
In preparing this regulation, the Attorney General stated that the Department of Justice was “carrying out one of the central principles of the asylum reform process begun in 1993; to discourage applicants from making patently false claims.” Inspection and Expedited Removal of Aliens; Detention and Removal of Aliens; Conduct of Removal Proceedings; Asylum Procedures, 62 Fed. Reg. 444, 447 (Jan. 3, 1997) (Supplementary Information). In the Federal Register Notice promulgating the final “Asylum Procedures” rule in 2000, the Attorney General added the following observations:
One commenter stated that the regulatory definition of “frivolous” does not contain appropriate safeguards, and that the Service should advise every asylum applicant of the consequences of filing frivolous claims. The current regulation provides appropriate safeguards by stipulating that an immigration judge or the Board must be satisfied that an applicant had sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies before finding that an applicant filed a frivolous application, and by permitting an applicant to seek withholding of removal even if he or she is found to have filed a frivolous application. The regulation itself also advises an applicant that he or she is subject to the provisions of section 208(d)(6) of the Act if a final order specifically finds that the alien knowingly filed a frivolous application. Finally, both the instructions to the Form I-589 and the application itself warn the applicant about the consequences of filing a frivolous claim, as required by section 208(d)(4) of the Act.

*155 III. APPLYING THE STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
 
The implementing regulation provides a comprehensive framework for determining whether an asylum application is frivolous. Given the serious consequences of a frivolousness finding, the regulation provides a number of procedural safeguards. These include the following requirements: (1) notice to the alien of the consequences of filing a frivolous application; (2) a specific finding by the Immigration Judge or the Board that the alien knowingly filed a frivolous application; (3) sufficient evidence in the record to support the finding that a material element of the asylum application was deliberately fabricated; and (4) an indication that the alien has been afforded sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim.1 We address each of these requirements in turn.
  
A. Notice
 
The statute and regulation require that the Attorney General advise the alien at the time of filing an asylum application of the consequences of filing a frivolous application, i.e., permanent ineligibility for any benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act except for withholding of removal. See section 208(d)(6) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1208.20. In this case, the record includes a written notice from the Immigration Judge entitled “Notice of Privilege of Counsel and Consequences of Knowingly Filing a Frivolous Application for Asylum,” which sets forth the requisite warnings of the consequences of filing a frivolous asylum application.2 Additionally, the Form I-589 contains a written warning that “[a]pplicants determined to have knowingly made a frivolous application for asylum will be permanently ineligible for any benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act.” At the *156 time of filing the original application, then counsel for the respondent assured the Immigration Judge that he had informed the respondent of the consequences of filing a frivolous application for asylum. As the respondent has not asserted a lack of notice of the consequences of filing a frivolous asylum application, we will focus our attention on the other requirements for a frivolousness finding.
  
B. Specific Findings
 
**5 The regulation subjects an alien to the penalty provision for filing a frivolous application “only if a final order by an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals specifically finds that the alien knowingly filed a frivolous asylum application.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.20. The regulation further provides that “an asylum application is frivolous if any of its material elements is deliberately fabricated.” Id. An element of a claim is “fabricated” when it misrepresents the truth. Black’s Law Dictionary 597 (8th ed. 2004) (stating that “fabricated evidence” is “[f]alse or deceitful evidence”). A “deliberate” fabrication involves a knowing and intentional misrepresentation of the truth. Id. at. 459 (stating that “deliberate” means “[i]ntentional; premeditated; fully considered”). Therefore, an Immigration Judge’s specific finding that a respondent deliberately fabricated a material element of his asylum claim constitutes a finding that he knowingly filed a frivolous asylum application.
 
As a number of courts have observed, “‘a finding of frivolousness does not flow automatically from an adverse credibility determination.”’ Liu v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, supra, at 113 (quoting Muhanna v. Gonzales, 399 F.3d 582, 589 (3d Cir. 2005)); see also Scheerer v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 445 F.3d 1311, 1317 (11th Cir. 2006) (“[A]n adverse credibility determination alone cannot support a finding of frivolousness.”). We agree that the Immigration Judge must separately address the question of frivolousness, including a discussion of the evidence supporting a finding that the respondent deliberately fabricated a material element of the asylum claim.
 
The Immigration Judge in this case, after finding the respondent not credible, separately addressed the question of frivolousness and provided the following analysis:
[T]he respondent’s application for political asylum has been deliberately fabricated in order to obtain immigration benefits in the United States. The original I-589 application for political asylum indicates that the respondent has a daughter. The statement attached to that application indicates that his wife gave birth to that daughter and was hiding in order to be able to effectively give birth to that daughter. The respondent’s new application is totally and completely different. It states that the daughter was adopted when the respondent’s sister-in-law found the baby girl in a rice paddy.
 
The respondent’s Q&A airport statements and credible fear interviews also mention absolutely nothing about any family planning problems in the People’s Republic of China, not any alleged forced abortion. The documentary evidence is totally and *157 completely lacking in order to overcome these most glaring discrepancies. It appears that the respondent and his wife do have a daughter and that she was naturally born to the respondent. This is substantiated by the household registration booklet and notarial birth certificate, and that the respondent has fabricated this story about an adopted daughter, in order to obtain immigration benefits in the United States. I, therefore, find that the respondent’s application for asylum must also be deemed frivolous.
 
**6 In these two paragraphs the Immigration Judge finds that the respondent “deliberately fabricated” the account of the abortion and illegal adoption in the second asylum application. As to materiality, she refers to “totally and completely different” aspects of the amended application-principally the account of the abortion and adoption. These findings meet the regulatory requirement that the Immigration Judge separately address and include specific findings that the respondent deliberately fabricated material elements of his asylum claim.
  
C. Burden of proof
 
We now turn to whether the Immigration Judge’s findings are supported by the evidence of record. In its remand, the court has requested that we provide guidance regarding “who carries the burden of proof, what degree of certainty is required, when an opportunity to be heard will be deemed sufficient, how ‘deliberate’ and ‘material’ a fabrication must be, and what deference the BIA owes to an IJ’s finding in this context.” Liu v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, supra, at 113.
 
Ordinarily, an applicant for relief from removal has the burden of demonstrating that he or she meets all of the requirements for eligibility for the applicable form of relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d) (2006) (providing that the alien shall have “the burden of establishing that he or she is eligible for any requested benefit or privilege and that it should be granted in the exercise of discretion”). Moreover, “[i]f the evidence indicates that one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply, the alien shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such grounds do not apply.” Id.
 
A frivolousness finding, unlike a determination in regard to eligibility for a particular form of relief governed by 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d), is a preemptive determination which, once made, forever bars an alien from any benefit under the Act. Because of the severe consequences that flow from a frivolousness finding, the preponderance of the evidence must support an Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent knowingly and deliberately fabricated material elements of the claim. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.20. Under the regulation, plausible explanations offered by the respondent must be considered in the ultimate determination whether the preponderance of the evidence supports a frivolousness finding.
 
*158 In regard to the requisite degree of proof, the court in Liu v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, supra, at 114, suggests that an emerging principle may be that in light of the serious consequences stemming from a frivolousness finding, “concrete and conclusive evidence of fabrication” should be required to support a finding of frivolousness. The court makes this suggestion after reviewing four published decisions upholding frivolousness findings and concluding that each involved “tangible evidence of fabrication that could not reasonably be disputed.” Id. at 115 (citing Ignatova v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1209, 1214 (8th Cir. 2005) (medical records submitted by the alien were identified by the hospital as fraudulent); Selami v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 621, 626-27 (6th Cir. 2005) (copied documents provided by the alien were clear forgeries when compared to true copies of the originals); Efe v. Ashcroft, 293 F.3d 899, 908 (5th Cir. 2002) (alien’s claim regarding age was conclusively disproved by dental records); Barreto-Claro v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 275 F.3d 1334, 1339 (11th Cir. 2001) (alien admitting he lied in his previously filed asylum application).
 
**7 We find no indication in the statute or regulation that a frivolousness finding must be supported by “concrete or conclusive” evidence of fabrication. As a general rule, “the law draws no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence in requiring the government to carry its burden of proof.” United States v. MacPherson, 424 F.3d 183, 190 (2d Cir. 2005). Moreover, proof that conduct was knowing or deliberate may be demonstrated by circumstantial evidence. Mayer v. Oil Field Systems Corp., 803 F.2d 749 (2d Cir. 1986). After taking into account the respondent’s explanations for discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim, however, the Immigration Judge must provide cogent and convincing reasons for finding by a preponderance of the evidence that an asylum applicant knowingly and deliberately fabricated material elements of the claim.
 
As the Attorney General emphasized at the time the regulation was promulgated, the regulatory standards for the frivolousness finding have been formulated with the severity of the consequences in mind. See Asylum Procedures, 65 Fed. Reg. at 76,128 (“The Department believes that the current regulation provides for appropriate safeguards for filing a frivolous asylum application, and that, for the reasons set forth in the supplemental information to the January 3, 1997, proposed rule, the definition of frivolous is sufficient.”) (Supplementary Information). As discussed below, in addition to mandating notice of consequences and specific findings of deliberate fabrication of a material element of the asylum application, as well as placing the ultimate burden of proof on the Government, the regulation requires that particular attention be given to providing the alien a sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim relied on in the frivolousness finding.
 
In considering an appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision filed after September 25, 2002, as was the appeal in this case, we give de novo review *159 to questions of law, discretion, and judgment, but review findings of fact only for clear error. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i)-(ii) (2006). We may not engage in fact-finding of our own other than to take administrative notice of commonly known facts. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Determining whether a fabrication was knowing or deliberate is a factual question of intent that is reviewed for clear error. See United States v. Awadallah, 349 F.3d 42, 65 (2d Cir. 2003). Whether a fabrication was material involves mixed questions of fact and law. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 521 (1995). Whether the Immigration Judge properly applied the regulatory framework is a question of law.
 
**8 In her decision, the Immigration Judge identified concerns regarding discrepancies and plausibility that indicated to her that the respondent may have deliberately fabricated material elements of his amended asylum application. See Monter v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 546, 553-54 (2d Cir. 2005) (stating that a misrepresentation is material if it has “‘a natural tendency to influence or was capable of influencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed”’ (quoting Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 770 (1988))). These concerns were not mere incidental or tangential discrepancies or omissions. As the court acknowledged in its assessment of the Immigration Judge’s credibility determination, the respondent’s claim in his original application “that his wife gave birth to their second child, rather than simply reporting (without emphasis or elaboration) that they had adopted their daughter in May 1991” is a “glaring inconsistency” when compared to the new claims in the amended application based on an illegal adoption of that same child after a forced abortion. Liu v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, supra, at 111.
 
As the respondent’s explanations must be considered in determining whether a preponderance of the evidence ultimately supports the frivolousness finding, we turn to the question whether the respondent was afforded a sufficient opportunity to account for the discrepancies and implausible aspects of his claim relied on by the Immigration Judge.
  
D. Sufficient Opportunity To Explain
 
The regulation requires that the frivolousness finding “shall only be made if the immigration judge or the Board is satisfied that the applicant, during the course of the proceedings, has had sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.20. The regulation requires that the alien be given “ample opportunity during his hearing to address and account for any deliberate, material fabrications upon which the IJ may base a finding of frivolousness.” Mingkid v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 468 F.3d 763, 769 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Scheerer v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 1317).
 
In order to afford a sufficient opportunity to account for discrepancies, it would be a good practice for an Immigration Judge who believes that an  *160 applicant may have submitted a frivolous asylum application to bring this concern to the attention of the applicant prior to the conclusion of proceedings. See, e.g., Farah v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1153, 1158 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that where the Immigration Judge relied on different inconsistencies in making the adverse credibility determination from those used in making the frivolousness determination, the respondent lacked a sufficient opportunity to explain the discrepancies related to the frivolousness finding). In some cases, the Government may raise the issue of frivolousness during the course of the hearing. See, e.g., Ignatova v. Gonzales, supra, at 1214 (noting that the Government filed a motion requesting that the Immigration Judge address whether the application was frivolous). In other situations, the Immigration Judge may raise the issue and afford the respondent an opportunity to respond with an explanation or corroborating evidence. See, e.g., Selami v. Gonzales, supra (observing that the Immigration Judge adjourned the hearing to afford the respondent an opportunity to respond to concerns that documents submitted in support of his asylum application appeared to be forged).
 
**9 In the case before us, the Immigration Judge did not mention during the course of the hearing that she was contemplating a frivolousness finding. We do not find that the particular concerns underlying the frivolousness finding were such that the respondent should necessarily have anticipated such a finding and provided explanations relevant to the question whether he deliberately fabricated the account of the forced abortion and illegal adoption in the second application. See Ye v. Dep’t of Homeland Security, 446 F.3d 289 (2d Cir. 2006) (finding that for purposes of an adverse credibility determination the respondent need not be afforded an opportunity to respond to self-evident inconsistencies).3
 
The respondent did, however, explain during the course of the hearing why the new claims in his amended asylum application were not included in his original application. In a cover statement accompanying his amended application, he explained that when he filed the original asylum application he did not know that family planning was a basis for asylum, that he had never spoken to his first attorney, that the original asylum application was never read *161 back to him, and that he did not have a chance to correct mistakes in the original application prior to the time it was filed in Immigration Court.4
 
Although the respondent’s explanations raise as many questions as they answer, they do have some bearing on whether he deliberately fabricated critical aspects of the amended application and, therefore, should have been addressed and evaluated by the Immigration Judge. See Ming Shi Xue v. BIA, 439 F.3d 111, 123 (2d Cir. 2006) (finding that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to consider the explanations that an applicant gave in order to rectify discrepancies in testimony).
 
The respondent essentially blames his first attorney and that attorney’s secretary for including incorrect information in his first application, for missing essential elements of his persecution claim that necessitated the filing of an amended application, and for failing to obtain his verification of the contents of his statement accompanying the original application. The regulation provides that “[t]he applicant’s signature [on an asylum application] establishes a presumption that the applicant is aware of the contents of the application.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.3(c)(2) (2006). The respondent’s first attorney signed the declaration under Part E of the original asylum application verifying that the information in the application “was provided to me by the applicant and that the completed application was read to the applicant in his or her native language or a language he or she understands for verification before he or she signed the application in my presence.”
 
Under the circumstances in this case, the Immigration Judge had good reason to be concerned with the plausibility of the abortion and illegal adoption aspects of the respondent’s amended asylum application. She should not, however, have entered a frivolousness finding without communicating these concerns to the respondent before concluding the proceedings and without addressing the respondent’s explanations. Had she confronted the respondent with her concerns, she could have further probed for clarification of the manner in which the original asylum application was prepared. See Matter of S-M-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1997) (describing the shared responsibility of parties and the Immigration Judge to assure that relevant *162 evidence is included the record). Further inquiry could have included a request for corroborating evidence from former counsel regarding the manner in which the first asylum application was prepared.5
  
IV. CONCLUSION
 
**10 At the time of filing his amended asylum application, the respondent provided explanations relevant to the question whether he had deliberately fabricated a material element of the claims in his amended asylum application. These explanations should have been more fully explored during the course of the hearing and addressed in the Immigration Judge’s decision. For these reasons, we find that the “frivolousness” determination in this case does not meet the regulatory requirement that the respondent be afforded a sufficient opportunity to explain perceived discrepancies or implausibilities. We will therefore vacate our prior decision to the extent that it affirms the Immigration Judges’ frivolousness finding and sustain the respondent’s appeal from that finding.
 
ORDER: Our prior decision is vacated to the extent that it affirms the Immigration Judge’s frivolousness finding, and the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s frivolousness finding is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent is ordered removed from the United States to the People’s Republic of China pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s decision of January 22, 2004.

In light of the regulatory requirement that there be evidence of a deliberate fabrication of a material element of a claim, the term “fraudulent” may be more appropriate than the term “frivolous” when applied to a questionable asylum application. See Barreto-Claro v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 275 F.3d 1334, 1339, n.11 (11th Cir. 2001) (observing that the term “frivolous” generally means “insignificant, trivial, silly or gay” (quoting Webster, New International Dictionary (3d ed. 1961))). Obvious legal insufficiency of a claim does not support a frivolousness finding. Scheerer v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 445 F.3d 1311, 1318 (11th Cir. 2006).

2

The notice, which was entered into the record as an exhibit on March 5, 2002, states in relevant part: “Before you file an asylum application (Form I-589) the law (section 208(d)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act) requires that you be advised specifically about the consequences of knowingly filing a frivolous application for asylum in the United States. If you knowingly file a frivolous application for asylum, YOU WILL BE BARRED FOREVER from receiving any benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act. A frivolous application for asylum is one which contains statements or responses to questions that are deliberately fabricated. Not being granted asylum does not mean that your application is frivolous.”

3

The requirement that the respondent be afforded a sufficient opportunity to explain is not to be applied in a mechanical fashion. There may be situations in which the deliberate fabrication of a material aspect of the asylum claim is so clear on the record that a formal request for an explanation would be a needless exercise. See, e.g., Barreto-Claro v. Att’y Gen., supra (finding that the respondent’s admissions that he stated falsely on his first asylum application that he had never before applied for refugee or asylum status and that he gave a fraudulent account of how he came to the United States established that he deliberately fabricated facts that were materially relevant to the question whether he had been firmly resettled in another country prior to arrival in the United States).

4

The respondent’s concession that his first statement included erroneous information is not enough in and of itself to indicate that he knowingly filed an application containing a deliberate fabrication of a material element of his claim. He contends that he was unaware of the incorrect information included in that application and unaware that his wife’s forced abortion or their fines for illegally adopting a child could be relevant to a claim for asylum. As we are limited to reviewing the Immigration Judge’s findings for clear error and do not engage in factual determinations, our focus on appeal is limited to whether the evidence supports a finding in regard to the factors in the amended asylum application identified by the Immigration Judge as deliberately fabricated or implausible material elements of the claim.

5

When an applicant for asylum claims ineffective assistance of counsel as an exception to the 1-year deadline for filing an asylum application, for example, he must file an affidavit describing the agreement entered into with counsel, inform counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned of the allegations being leveled and provide an opportunity to respond, and indicate whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal obligations. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5)(iii) (2006); see also Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (setting forth the same requirements for motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel).

IN RE: RICARDO SMALLHORNE MURRAY A.K.A RICARDO MURRAY
File: AXX XX9 518 - Houston
April 23, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The last order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on October 31, 2006. The respondent’s current motion, initially filed on February 2, 2007, is untimely and will be denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent argues that his former counsel, Richard Prinz, provided ineffective assistance of counsel in proceedings before the Immigration Judge, and that Ajay Choudhary, his subsequent counsel, provided ineffective assistance of counsel by refusing to pursue ineffective assistance charges against Mr. Prinz, and by instead pursuing a sua sponte reopening before the Immigration Judge. The respondent asserts that he has notified both attorneys of his actions and that he has filed a complaint against both attorneys with the Texas Bar Association.
 
According to the record, Mr. Prinz was the respondent’s attorney of record from January 31, 2001, until Mr. Choudhary’s firm filed a superceding notice of representation (EOIR-28) in June 2006, Mr. Prinz represented the respondent before the Immigration Judge, who rendered his decision on February 15, 2001, denying the motion for a sua sponte reopening before the Immigration Court. Although the respondent blames Mr. Choudhary for failure to pursue the matter, he has not offered a persuasive explanation to excuse the fact that he waited approximately 6 years to complain about Mr. Prinz’s representation. Equitable tolling of a regulatory deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf. Rashidi v. American President Lines, 96 F.3d 124, 127-28 (5th Cir. 1996). The respondent has presented no persuasive reason to toll the motions deadline for years. The motion to reopen, as it pertains to Mr. Prinz’s representation, is therefore denied.
 
As regards the accusations against Mr. Choudhary, the motion is also untimely. There is no indication that Mr. Choudhary’s representation was of such a nature as to offend the respondent’s right to due process. Even were we to accept the pending motion as timely, it would be denied, as the respondent failed to show prejudice resulting from claimed ineffective assistance of either counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62; (BIA 2003), Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 884 (5th Cir. 2004).
 
Because the motion is untimely, we could only reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). We take this action only in “exceptional situations.” Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373 (A.G. 2002); Wang v. Ashcroft, 260 F.3d 448, 453 n.4 (5th Cir. 2001). We decline to take such action here. The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kathy Giraitis
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Haiti, appeals the Immigration Judge’s January 19, 2007 decision finding him removable and denying his application for cancellation of removal for certain lawful permanent residents under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)has filed a motion for summary affirmance. We will dismiss the appeal.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Under this standard, the Board may not reverse an Immigration Judge’s factfinding unless we determine that the Immigration Judge committed clear error. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002) (stating that the Board must defer to the factual determinations of an Immigration Judge in the absence of clear error). In this case, we find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s factual findings. In addition, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s negative equities, including his criminal history, his lack of rehabilitation, and his misrepresentations made under oath to the Immigration Judge about his criminal history, compared to the police records, outweigh his family ties and other positive equities. See I.J. at 11-17; Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998); Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581 (BIA 1978). On appeal, the respondent indicates that the Immigration Judge gave insufficient weight to his positive equities and evidence of his rehabilitation. We disagree. The Immigration Judge considered these factors, but concluded that the respondent’s criminal activities indicated a lack of rehabilitation and outweighed his positive equities. The Immigration Judge also stated that the respondent’s misrepresentations to the court are a reason for discretionary denial of his application for cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge’s conclusions were reasonable and we find no reason to overturn them.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he was not properly represented by counsel and that there was a lack of due process. Specifically, he claims that the Immigration Judge did not allow two of his witnesses, one of his sister’s and one of his cousins, to testify at his hearing. To the extent that the respondent has attempted to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we find that he has failed to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 With regard to the claim of lack of due process, we note that there were numerous hearings and extensive testimony (see page transcript of the various hearings). The Immigration Judge allowed testimony from the respondent’s father’s cousin, whom the respondent referred to as his “uncle.” A review of the transcripts of the hearings does not indicate that the respondent’s sister or cousin were ever presented as witnesses. At the hearing on September 8, 2006, the respondent brought four friends, but not his sister, who apparently was sick (Tr. at 15-18). The Immigration Judge allowed these people into the courtroom and had each one identify themselves (Tr. at 16-18). However, the respondent never indicated that he wanted these people to testify on his behalf. In the course of that hearing, it was determined that the respondent had several criminal convictions (Tr. at 19-20, 27-32). The Immigration Judge found it necessary to continue the hearing in order for the parties to obtain all the criminal records. No testimony was elicited from any of the respondent’s friends. Further, we note that at the final merits hearing, the Immigration Judge specifically asked the respondent’s attorney if there were any other witnesses (Tr. at 83). Apparently, there were none as the respondent’s attorney made no request to call any additional witnesses to testify. Contrary to the respondent’s allegations, we find that the record of proceedings fails to show that the Immigration Judge refused to allow any of the respondent’s witnesses to testify. Accordingly, there is no evidence of a lack of due process.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

File: A71 788 812 - Los Angeles
April 6, 2007
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Seth L. Reszko, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On November 30, 2000, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying a motion to reopen. The respondent, who is from India, filed a motion to reopen with the Board on July 20, 2005. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board normally must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Therefore, to the extent that the respondent seeks reopening to apply for adjustment of status, based on “an approved I-140 petition,” the motion is untimely, and is denied.
 
The respondent argues that he is eligible to apply for suspension of deportation under the settlement agreement found at Barahona-Gomez v. Ashcroft, 243 F.Supp. 2d 1029 (N.D. Cal. 2002). That lawsuit challenged actions which prohibited Immigration Judges and the Board from granting suspension of deportation during the period between February 13 and April 1, 1997. On April 1, 1997, section 309(c)(5) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 took effect, and made individuals ineligible for suspension of deportation if they had not been continuously physically present in the United States for a period of seven years at the time that they were served with an Order to Show Cause.
 
Yet a motion to reopen seeking benefits under the Barahona-Gomez settlement agreement had to be filed during a “motion to reopen period” which ended on March 20, 2005. See Barahona-Gomez v. Ashcroft, supra, at 1036; 68 Fed. Reg. 13727-02 (Mar. 20, 2003); 69 Fed. Reg. 63178-01 (Oct. 29, 2004). The respondent claims that he “did not receive notice from the Executive Office for Immigration Review that he was an eligible class member”, and that the period for filing the motion should therefore be tolled (Respondent’s Mot., at pp. 6-7). In fact, notice of the settlement agreement was provided to individuals in the Federal Register (“[t]his notice is published because while the Executive Office for Immigration Review has the names and addresses of class members and counsels of record for the class member aliens, all parties recognize that some class members have failed to inform EOIR of address changes and the notice is necessary to inform those persons”). See 68 Fed. Reg. 13727-02 (Mar. 20, 2003).
 
*2 In any event, we will not reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), as the respondent does not fall within the purview of the Barahona-Gomez settlement agreement.
 
The respondent asserts that he is an “eligible class member” under Part II (A) of the settlement agreement. See Barahona-Gomez v. Ashcroft, supra, at 1031-32. This subsection of the settlement agreement defines as class members
individuals for whom the Immigration Judge either reserved a decision, or scheduled a merits hearing on a suspension application under Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) § 244 (as such section existed in 1996, before amendment by IIRIRA), between February 13, 1997 and April 1, 1997, and the hearing was continued until after April 1, 1997…
 
In this case, the Immigration Judge did not reserve a decision, or continue her decision until after April 1, 1997. Neither was the respondent denied suspension of deportation between October 1, 1996, and March 31, 1997, based on section 309(c)(5) of IIRIRA. See Barahona-Gomez v. Ashcroft, supra, at 1031-32. Rather, on March 19, 1997, the Immigration Judge issued a final decision in which the respondent was granted voluntary departure. The respondent thereafter filed a motion to reopen, which the Immigration Judge denied on May 18, 1998. The Immigration Judge explained in that order that at the March 19, 1997, deportation hearing, the respondent waived the right to apply for suspension of deportation. The Immigration Judge further denied the motion to reopen, which claimed that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel, as untimely and as failing to comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In our November 30, 2000, decision, we agreed with the Immigration Judge that the motion to reopen had been untimely filed, and the respondent failed to show ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
In the respondent’s case, therefore, a decision on his suspension application was not continued, or withheld until after April 1, 1997. Neither was he denied suspension of deportation between October 1, 1996, and March 31, 1997, based on section 309(c)(5) of IIRIRA. The respondent therefore does not fit under the Barahona-Gomez settlement agreement. See Barahona-Gomez v. Ashcroft, supra, at 1031-32. The respondent argues that an Immigration Judge “could have issued a decision denying or granting him suspension of deportation between February 13, 1997 and April 1, 1997, but for Mr. Narang’s prior attorney advising him to withdraw his application based upon the directive that Immigration Judges were required to deny suspension applications under section 309(c)(5) of IIRIRA” (Respondent’s Mot., at p. 9). Yet the fact remains that the Immigration Judge in this case did not deny or withhold suspension of deportation between the pertinent dates, based on section 309(c)(5) of IIRIRA. The respondent’s speculation about what might have occurred, had his attorney not withdrawn the suspension application, does not place him within the Barahona-Gomez settlement agreement. The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on September 9, 1998, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 6, 1997. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and, as a consequence, ineligible to apply for a waiver under the former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). On November 29, 2006, the respondent moved to reopen proceedings, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. He alleges that prior counsel failed to timely file his petition for review of our 1998 decision, and later, after the respondent had been removed, illegally re-entered, and was subject to reinstatement of his removal order, failed to advise him of his eligibility for reopening pursuant to Matter of Soriano, 21 I&N Dec. 516 (A.G. 1997). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argues that the respondent is not eligible for reopening either under Matter of Soriano, supra, or the applicable regulations, and also because the respondent has been previously deported. The respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
The respondent became a legal permanent resident in 1990. On April 22, 1996, the respondent pleaded guilty to the crime of delivery of methamphetamine, and was later sentenced to 24 months in prison. On May 24, 1996, the respondent was placed in deportation proceedings. On November 6, 1997, the Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to deportation from the United States under section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, and ineligible due to his status as an aggravated felon for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Act. On September 9, 1998, the Board affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge. The respondent hired an attorney to petition for review of that decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The attorney filed the petition for review on November 23, 1998, and the Ninth Circuit dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction on December 17, 1998, because it was untimely. The respondent was deported to Mexico.
 
On December 20, 2000, the respondent was found in the United States. The respondent was notified of the government’s intent to reinstate the prior deportation order pursuant to section 241(a)(5) of the Act, and on January 16, 2001, the respondent was removed pursuant to the reinstated deportation order.
 
*2 On May 16, 2006, the respondent was charged and indicted in the Eastern District of Washington under section 276(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b) (presence in the United States without permission after removal). On November 29, 2006, the respondent moved to reopen deportation proceedings. He contends that when his deportation order was reinstated in 2001, he was eligible to file a special motion to reopen pursuant to Matter of Soriano, supra, and was not informed by his attorney or by the then-Immigration and Naturalization Service that he could reopen on that basis. He also contends that his case should now be reopened pursuant to the federal regulations relating to special motions to reopen for 212(c) relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44 (special motion to seek section 212(c) relief or aliens who pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to certain crimes before April 1, 1997).
 
We will address the respondent’s claims in order. First, because he conceded he was subject to deportation based on the aggravated felony charge after the enactment of Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (Tr. at 19, November 5, 1997), he was not eligible to pursue a motion to reopen under the allowance provided in Matter of Soriano, supra. Furthermore, under section 241(a)(5) of the Act, the respondent, who reentered the United States illegally after being deported or removed in 1998, was not eligible for and could not have applied for any relief under the Act at the time his removal order was reinstated.
 
Second, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel relating to acts or omissions of prior counsel in 1998 and 2001 are without merit. The respondent failed to demonstrate even minimal adherence to the requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Azanor v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 1013, 1023 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding an ineffective assistance of counsel claim inadequate where the alien failed to comply with the threshold procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, and the facts underlying his claim were not plain on the face of the record). The respondent failed to show that he was prejudiced to such an extent that his prior counsel’s performance “may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
Finally, the respondent is ineligible for a grant of a special 212(c) motion under the applicable regulations. The regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(h) provides that a special 212(c) motion must be filed on or before April 26, 2005. Here, the respondent’s motion was not filed until November 29, 2006. The regulatory limitation on motions provided in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) is not at issue in this case. Compare Lin v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2007). In addition, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(k)(2) prohibits the filing of a special 212(c) motion by an alien who has been issued a final order of deportation or removal, who then illegally returns to the United States. Accordingly, the following order will be entered:

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Victor D. Nieblas Pradis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dona J.F. Justus,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. This matter was last before us on March 25, 2004, when we adopted and affirmed the Immigration Judge’s February 13, 2003, decision in which he denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not pertinent here), a motion to reopen in any matter previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision, or by September 30, 1996, whichever is later. In the instant matter, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before June 23, 2004. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until December 22, 2006. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time. The respondent argues, however, that equitable tolling should be applied to the filing deadline because of the ineffective assistance of her previous counsel. Specifically, she claims that although she inquired several times about the status of her appeal before the Board, her counsel did not inform her of the Board’s March 25, 2004, decision until some time in March 2006. As a result, she contends, she missed filing deadlines of the Court of Appeals and this Board, and was denied adjustment of status because of the outstanding 1988 in absentia deportation order issued against her. She has reasserted her argument that she did not appear at her 1988 deportation hearing because she did not receive notice of it. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief in opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
To prevail on a due process claim based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien must satisfy the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The alien must show that “the representation afforded [him or her] was so deficient as to impinge upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing.” See Paul v. INS, 521 F.2d 194, 198 (5th Cir. 1975). To prevail on a due process claim, the alien must establish that substantial prejudice resulted from the due process violation. See Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir. 2004); Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001); Ogbemudia v. INS, 988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir. 1993). Further, we have held that the mere failure to file an appeal does not necessarily amount to substantial prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (failing to timely file an appeal is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel without showing that alien would likely have prevailed on appeal).
 
*2 Here, the respondent supported her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with an affidavit to the State Bar of California in which she sets out the basis for her complaint against her former attorney; an untranslated document entitled “Contrato;” a November 9, 2006, letter to her former counsel informing her of the complaint being filed against her; and a copy of a notice from the State Bar of California showing that it had received the respondent’s complaint against her former counsel. The respondent’s submissions fall short of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, which requires the alien to lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between her and her former counsel, and to provide a copy of the attorney/client agreement. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g) (requiring certified English translation of documents).
 
Even if we found the respondent satisfied the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, she has not provided any previously unavailable evidence establishing prima facie proof that if this matter were reopened, she would prevail on her argument that she failed to appear at her 1988 deportation hearing because she did not receive notice. Reopening is therefore not warranted. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). For that reason, the respondent has also failed to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from her previous counsel’s actions and her due process claim fails. See Zavala v. Ashcroft, supra; Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, supra; Ogbemudia v. INS, supra.
 
Further, we do not find that equitable tolling should be applied here because the respondent failed to exercise due diligence. See Rashidi v. American President Lines, 96 F.3d 124, 127-28 (5th Cir. 1996) (requiring due diligence to toll the statute of limitations period). Our records show that the respondent filed an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision with this Board on March 6, 2003. In her affidavit supporting her complaint to the State Bar of California, the respondent reveals that she first contacted her attorney’s office in May 2004, more than a year after the appeal was filed, to get a status report. According to her affidavit, although she had not spoken personally to her previous counsel, she then waited another 10 months to make her second inquiry, which was some time in March 2005. According to her affidavit, she was again unable to talk to her previous counsel. Nonetheless, the respondent waited yet another 12 months to make her third and final inquiry in March 2006. After finally speaking with her counsel, the respondent did not file the instant motion until almost 7 months later. Given the stakes here, the facts as presented by the respondent lead us to the conclusion that she failed to exercise due diligence.
 
*3 Finally, the respondent requests that we take this case sua sponte. “As a general rule, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002); Matter of J-J-,21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The respondent has not persuaded us that this matter falls into the category of matters wherein we should invoke our authority to reopen sua sponte. Accordingly, the motion is denied as untimely.

File: AXX-XX6-139 - Harlingen

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Victor D. Nieblas Pradis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dona J.F. Justus,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. This matter was last before us on March 25, 2004, when we adopted and affirmed the Immigration Judge’s February 13, 2003, decision in which he denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not pertinent here), a motion to reopen in any matter previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision, or by September 30, 1996, whichever is later. In the instant matter, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before June 23, 2004. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until December 22, 2006. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time. The respondent argues, however, that equitable tolling should be applied to the filing deadline because of the ineffective assistance of her previous counsel. Specifically, she claims that although she inquired several times about the status of her appeal before the Board, her counsel did not inform her of the Board’s March 25, 2004, decision until some time in March 2006. As a result, she contends, she missed filing deadlines of the Court of Appeals and this Board, and was denied adjustment of status because of the outstanding 1988 in absentia deportation order issued against her. She has reasserted her argument that she did not appear at her 1988 deportation hearing because she did not receive notice of it. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief in opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
To prevail on a due process claim based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien must satisfy the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The alien must show that “the representation afforded ¿him or herº was so deficient as to impinge upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing.” See Paul v. INS, 521 F.2d 194, 198 (5th Cir. 1975). To prevail on a due process claim, the alien must establish that substantial prejudice resulted from the due process violation. See Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir. 2004); Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001); Ogbemudia v. INS, 988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir. 1993). Further, we have held that the mere failure to file an appeal does not necessarily amount to substantial prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (failing to timely file an appeal is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel without showing that alien would likely have prevailed on appeal).
 
*2 Here, the respondent supported her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with an affidavit to the State Bar of California in which she sets out the basis for her complaint against her former attorney; an untranslated document entitled “Contrato;” a November 9, 2006, letter to her former counsel informing her of the complaint being filed against her; and a copy of a notice from the State Bar of California showing that it had received the respondent’s complaint against her former counsel. The respondent’s submissions fall short of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, which requires the alien to lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between her and her former counsel, and to provide a copy of the attorney/client agreement. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g) (requiring certified English translation of documents).
 
Even if we found the respondent satisfied the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, she has not provided any previously unavailable evidence establishing prima facie proof that if this matter were reopened, she would prevail on her argument that she failed to appear at her 1988 deportation hearing because she did not receive notice. Reopening is therefore not warranted. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). For that reason, the respondent has also failed to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from her previous counsel’s actions and her due process claim fails. See Zavala v. Ashcroft, supra; Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, supra; Ogbemudia v. INS, supra.
 
Further, we do not find that equitable tolling should be applied here because the respondent failed to exercise due diligence. See Rashidi v. American President Lines, 96 F.3d 124, 127-28 (5th Cir. 1996) (requiring due diligence to toll the statute of limitations period). Our records show that the respondent filed an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision with this Board on March 6, 2003. In her affidavit supporting her complaint to the State Bar of California, the respondent reveals that she first contacted her attorney’s office in May 2004, more than a year after the appeal was filed, to get a status report. According to her affidavit, although she had not spoken personally to her previous counsel, she then waited another 10 months to make her second inquiry, which was some time in March 2005. According to her affidavit, she was again unable to talk to her previous counsel. Nonetheless, the respondent waited yet another 12 months to make her third and final inquiry in March 2006. After finally speaking with her counsel, the respondent did not file the instant motion until almost 7 months later. Given the stakes here, the facts as presented by the respondent lead us to the conclusion that she failed to exercise due diligence.
 
*3 Finally, the respondent requests that we take this case sua sponte. “As a general rule, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002); Matter of J-J-,21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The respondent has not persuaded us that this matter falls into the category of matters wherein we should invoke our authority to reopen sua sponte. Accordingly, the motion is denied as untimely.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: MARIA SABAS GOMEZ-NAVA
File: A72 309 675 - Los Angeles
March 19, 2007
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Elsa I. Martinez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James M. Left
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on August 17, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s November 30, 2004, decision denying the respondent’s second motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered deported in absentia on June 27, 1997.1 The respondent filed a petition for review of our decision with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On September 19, 2006, the Ninth Circuit granted an unopposed motion to remand and returned the record to the Board for further proceedings. The unopposed motion sought a remand because the Board had not sufficiently articulated its reasons for dismissing the appeal. The Board’s August 17, 2005, decision will be vacated and the respondent’s appeal reinstated. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent raises a variety of issues, each of which will be addressed in turn. In its appellate brief, the DHS states that the respondent’s Notice of Appeal was not timely filed. It contends that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal as a result of the untimely filing.
 
We first address the issue of jurisdiction. The record reflects that although the Immigration Judge rendered his decision on November 30, 2004, the decision was not mailed to the parties until December 7, 2004. The respondent’s appeal was received at the Board on January 6, 2005. Thus, the respondent’s motion was filed within 30 days of the mailing of the decision and is therefore timely.
 
We next examine the merits of the respondent’s appeal. The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that her motion was numerically barred when there are no time and number restrictions on motions to reopen in which an alien claims to have lacked notice of a scheduled hearing and was ordered deported in absentia. We agree. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(2). However, the respondent raises in her second motion essentially the same argument that she raised in her first motion - namely that the notice was not properly addressed.2 Moreover, she was aware of the fact that she had been ordered deported in absentia at the time that she filed her first motion to reopen yet waited over 7 years to file a second motion to reopen in which she again alleged a lack of notice. An alien cannot file what is essentially the same motion to reopen over and over. Thus, this issue has been fully litigated.
 
The respondent further contends on appeal that her lack of notice constitutes an exceptional circumstance which serves to equitably toll the numerical restrictions on motions to reopen. She states that she provided her correct address to the then Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officer and that due to an INS clerical error, her apartment number was omitted from her address which resulted in her not receiving notice of her scheduled hearing. We disagree. As a motion to reopen premised upon a claim of exceptional circumstances, the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely because it was not filed within 180 days of the respondent’s in absentia order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(B)(4)(ii). We also do not find that this untimeliness is subject to equitable tolling. Although the respondent contends that her former attorney did not advise her of the Immigration Judge’s denial of her first motion to reopen, she had not established that she exercised due diligence in this case. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion on September 18, 1997, yet the respondent did not file a second motion to reopen until October 29, 2004, over 7 years later. The respondent does not state when, or how often, she contacted her former attorney or describe the efforts that she undertook to remain apprised of the status of the motion to reopen that her former attorney had filed on her behalf. We find that these facts do not support a finding that the respondent exercised due diligence in this case. As she has not demonstrated the requisite due diligence, the untimeliness of her exceptional circumstances claim is not subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling.
 
*2 She also asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in stating that he could not construe the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) lack of response to her motion as agreement to reopen since the regulation provides that a motion is deemed unopposed unless a timely response is made. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(iv). The lack of a response from the non-moving party does not mean that a party’s motion to reopen must be granted regardless of its content or merits. In all cases, a party moving to reopen proceedings has the burden of demonstrating that proceedings should be reopened. The respondent in this case failed to meet that burden for the reasons set forth in this decision. Therefore, if the Immigration Judge erred on this point, such error is harmless.
 
The respondent additionally claims that her former attorney, Donald K. Smith, Esquire, did not inform her of the contents of the affidavit that she signed in her first motion to reopen, included in the motion incorrect facts regarding whether she ever lived on the Valley View Street, and failed to inform her of the Immigration Judge’s denial of her first motion to reopen. From these arguments, the respondent appears to be claiming that she received ineffective assistance of counsel from Mr. Smith. She has not, however, complied with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and re-affirmed in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). See also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that motions to reopen alleging ineffective assistance can be denied by the Board where the alien does not meet the Lozada requirements as such rules are reasonable in ordinary circumstances). The respondent does not explain her failure to comply with the Lozada requirements. As a result of such failure, Mr. Smith is deprived of an opportunity to respond to these allegations and the Board is deprived of Mr. Smith’s responses.
 
Lastly, the respondent states that she is adjustment of status eligible because she has an approved visa petition (Form I-130) which was filed by her lawful permanent resident husband. She advises that her husband is in the process of applying for naturalization. However, the respondent has provided no evidence showing that she is married, her husband is a lawful permanent resident, her husband filed a visa petition on her behalf, or that a visa petition for her has been approved. Statements of counsel are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Thus, the respondent has not established that she is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The Board’s August 17, 2005, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is reinstated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Following the issuance of the in absentia order, the respondent filed with the Immigration Judge, on August 18, 1997, a motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on September 18, 1997. The respondent filed a second motion to reopen with the Immigration Court on October 29, 2004. It is the denial of this second motion which the respondent appealed to the Board and which was the subject of our August 17, 2005, decision.

We note that the respondent stated in her first motion that she did not live at the address provided on the hearing notice whereas she said in her second motion that she did live at that address but that such address omitted her apartment number. We consider these arguments, when viewed in the context of the entire record, as a minor difference of degree since the thrust of her arguments is that the “7777 Valley View Street” address was incorrect since it was incomplete.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: EMMETT GRENALD
File: A36 489 029 - Newark
March 19, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 27, 2006, at which time the Board denied the respondent’s appeal. On December 13, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,”) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent argues that he is a United States citizen based on the United States citizenship of his father. We observe that the respondent’s motion to reopen is timely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). A motion to reopen will not be granted where the evidence supporting the motion was previously available and could have been presented at the previous hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). In the instant case, the respondent presents an affidavit from his father and a copy of this man’s birth certificate. See Motion to Reopen. First, this evidence is not new or previously unavailable evidence. See Tr. at 52 (discussing the respondent’s father). This evidence could have been previously presented to the Immigration Judge and this Board. To the extent that the respondent is arguing that he has an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his prior attorney for failing to submit this evidence, we observe that the respondent has not complied with any of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Furthermore, as discussed below, the evidence submitted does not establish his eligibility for relief, so the respondent has not shown the required prejudice. See Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98, 107 (3rd Cir. 2005).
 
The respondent’s argument that he is entitled to United States citizenship based on his United States citizen father is incorrect. The burden of proof in establishing alienage in removal proceedings is on the DHS. United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U.S. 149 (1923); United States v. Neelly, 207 F.2d 281 (7th Cir. 1953). However, one born abroad is prima facie an alien. Matter of A-M-, 7 I&N Dec. 332 (BIA 1956). Furthermore, where it is undisputed that an alien sought to be deported was born in a foreign country and came to the United States from that country, the burden of proof to establish United States citizenship is upon the alien. United States v. Neelly, supra. Such an alien is required to affirmatively establish his citizenship claim. Matter of A-M-, supra.
 
*2 In the instant case, it is uncontested that the respondent was born in Panama and was born out of wedlock. See Exh. 1; Motion to Reopen. A child born out of wedlock to a United States citizen father, bears the additional burden of establishing a relationship to the father which is legally recognized under our immigration law. Specifically, the respondent must satisfy the requirements outlined in current section 309(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1409.
 
We observe that the respondent was born on December 23, 1971 (Exh. 2). Children born after November 14, 1971, must comply with the requirements of the current version of section 309 of the Act. See Pub. L. 100-525, § 23(e)(3), 102 Stat. 2619. Current section 309 of the amended Act provides, in pertinent part:
(a) The provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (g) of section 301, and of paragraph (2) of section 308 shall apply as of the date of birth to a person born out of wedlock if -
(1) a blood relationship between the person and the father is established by clear and convincing evidence.
 
(2) the father had the nationality of the United States at the time of the person’s birth.
 
(3) the father (unless deceased) has agreed in writing to provide financial support for the person until the person reaches the age of 18 years and
 
(4) while the person is under the age of 18 years -
(A) the person is legitimated under the law of the person’s residence or domicile.
 
(B) the father acknowledges paternity of the person in writing under oath, or
 
(C) the paternity of the person is established by adjudication of a competent court.
 
 
 
 
We observe that the evidence submitted by the respondent, who is now 35 years-old, does not establish that the respondent meets the requirements under current section 309(a)(4) of the Act. Specifically, the affidavit submitted does not suggest that the respondent’s father had legitimated the respondent, acknowledged his paternity under oath or had his paternity established in court prior to the respondent’s eighteenth birthday. See Motion to Reopen, affidavit of Emmet Ryan King, (noting that he is not listed on the respondent’s birth certificate).
 
In setting forth the effective date of the ““new”” section 309(a), the Immigration Technical Corrections Act of 1988 (
Pub. L. 100-525, 102 Stat 2609
(Oct. 24, 1988), amended the INA to provide that “except as provided in paragraph (2)03)
 
the new section 309(a)
 
shall apply to persons who have not attained 18 years of age as of the date of the enactment of this Act” (i.e., by November 14, 1986). That paragraph provides that “(2) [t]he old section 309(a) shall apply (A) to any individual who has attained 18 years of age as of the date of enactment of this Act, and (B) any individual with respect to whom paternity was established by legitimation before such date.” See section 23(e)(1) of the Immigration Technical Corrections Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-525, 102 Stat 2609 (Oct. 24, 1988).
 
*3 We next turn to the question of whether the respondent has shown that he was legitimated before November 14, 1986 (the INAA effective date) for purposes of “old” section 309(a) of the Act. Under the Act, legitimation can take place either under the laws of the respondent’s place of birth or under the laws of the state of the respondent’s father’s domicile. See section 101(b)(1) of the Act. In addition to the terms of the “(2)(B)” exception requiring legitimation to take place by November 14, 1986, legitimation must take place prior to the child reaching the age of 21. See former section 309(a) of the Act. In this case, the affidavit from the respondent’s father indicates that he was not included on the respondent’s birth certificate and left Panama shortly after the respondent’s birth. See Motion to Reopen, affidavit of Emmet Ryan King. There is no evidence to suggest that the respondent’s father acknowledged his paternity in Panama before November 14, 1986. See Matter of Sinclair, 13 I&N Dec. 613 (BIA 1970)(finding the a declaration of paternity in Panama before the Mayor of Colon sufficient to legitimate an out-of-wedlock child). The record indicates the respondent’s father’s resided in New Jersey from 1971-1985. The record is unclear as to which state he resided in from 1985 until November 14, 1986. However, there is no evidence establishing that the respondent’s father legitimated him under the laws of any state during this time period. We note that the burden is on the respondent, who was born in Panama, to establish his citizenship. For reasons discussed above, we find that the respondent has not met his burden. We therefore decline to reopen these proceedings. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: EMMETT GRENALD
File: AXX XX9 029 - Newark

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 27, 2006, at which time the Board denied the respondent’s appeal. On December 13, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,”) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent argues that he is a United States citizen based on the United States citizenship of his father. We observe that the respondent’s motion to reopen is timely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). A motion to reopen will not be granted where the evidence supporting the motion was previously available and could have been presented at the previous hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). In the instant case, the respondent presents an affidavit from his father and a copy of this man’s birth certificate. See Motion to Reopen. First, this evidence is not new or previously unavailable evidence. See Tr. at 52 (discussing the respondent’s father). This evidence could have been previously presented to the Immigration Judge and this Board. To the extent that the respondent is arguing that he has an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his prior attorney for failing to submit this evidence, we observe that the respondent has not complied with any of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Furthermore, as discussed below, the evidence submitted does not establish his eligibility for relief, so the respondent has not shown the required prejudice. See Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98, 107 (3rd Cir. 2005).
 
The respondent’s argument that he is entitled to United States citizenship based on his United States citizen father is incorrect. The burden of proof in establishing alienage in removal proceedings is on the DHS. United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U.S. 149 (1923); United States v. Neelly, 207 F.2d 281 (7th Cir. 1953). However, one born abroad is prima facie an alien. Matter of A-M-, 7 I&N Dec. 332 (BIA 1956). Furthermore, where it is undisputed that an alien sought to be deported was born in a foreign country and came to the United States from that country, the burden of proof to establish United States citizenship is upon the alien. United States v. Neelly, supra. Such an alien is required to affirmatively establish his citizenship claim. Matter of A-M-, supra.
 
*2 In the instant case, it is uncontested that the respondent was born in Panama and was born out of wedlock. See Exh. 1; Motion to Reopen. A child born out of wedlock to a United States citizen father, bears the additional burden of establishing a relationship to the father which is legally recognized under our immigration law. Specifically, the respondent must satisfy the requirements outlined in current section 309(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1409.
 
We observe that the respondent was born on December 23, 1971 (Exh. 2). Children born after November 14, 1971, must comply with the requirements of the current version of section 309 of the Act. See Pub. L. 100-525, § 23(e)(3), 102 Stat. 2619. Current section 309 of the amended Act provides, in pertinent part:
(a) The provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (g) of section 301, and of paragraph (2) of section 308 shall apply as of the date of birth to a person born out of wedlock if -
(1) a blood relationship between the person and the father is established by clear and convincing evidence.
 
(2) the father had the nationality of the United States at the time of the person’s birth.
 
(3) the father (unless deceased) has agreed in writing to provide financial support for the person until the person reaches the age of 18 years and
 
(4) while the person is under the age of 18 years -
(A) the person is legitimated under the law of the person’s residence or domicile.
 
(B) the father acknowledges paternity of the person in writing under oath, or
 
(C) the paternity of the person is established by adjudication of a competent court.
 
 
 
 
We observe that the evidence submitted by the respondent, who is now 35 years-old, does not establish that the respondent meets the requirements under current section 309(a)(4) of the Act. Specifically, the affidavit submitted does not suggest that the respondent’s father had legitimated the respondent, acknowledged his paternity under oath or had his paternity established in court prior to the respondent’s eighteenth birthday. See Motion to Reopen, affidavit of Emmet Ryan King, (noting that he is not listed on the respondent’s birth certificate).
 
In setting forth the effective date of the ““new”” section 309(a), the Immigration Technical Corrections Act of 1988 (
Pub. L. 100-525, 102 Stat 2609
(Oct. 24, 1988), amended the INA to provide that “except as provided in paragraph (2)03)
 
the new section 309(a)
 
shall apply to persons who have not attained 18 years of age as of the date of the enactment of this Act” (i.e., by November 14, 1986). That paragraph provides that “(2) ¿tºhe old section 309(a) shall apply (A) to any individual who has attained 18 years of age as of the date of enactment of this Act, and (B) any individual with respect to whom paternity was established by legitimation before such date.” See section 23(e)(1) of the Immigration Technical Corrections Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-525, 102 Stat 2609 (Oct. 24, 1988).
 
*3 We next turn to the question of whether the respondent has shown that he was legitimated before November 14, 1986 (the INAA effective date) for purposes of “old” section 309(a) of the Act. Under the Act, legitimation can take place either under the laws of the respondent’s place of birth or under the laws of the state of the respondent’s father’s domicile. See section 101(b)(1) of the Act. In addition to the terms of the “(2)(B)” exception requiring legitimation to take place by November 14, 1986, legitimation must take place prior to the child reaching the age of 21. See former section 309(a) of the Act. In this case, the affidavit from the respondent’s father indicates that he was not included on the respondent’s birth certificate and left Panama shortly after the respondent’s birth. See Motion to Reopen, affidavit of Emmet Ryan King. There is no evidence to suggest that the respondent’s father acknowledged his paternity in Panama before November 14, 1986. See Matter of Sinclair, 13 I&N Dec. 613 (BIA 1970)(finding the a declaration of paternity in Panama before the Mayor of Colon sufficient to legitimate an out-of-wedlock child). The record indicates the respondent’s father’s resided in New Jersey from 1971-1985. The record is unclear as to which state he resided in from 1985 until November 14, 1986. However, there is no evidence establishing that the respondent’s father legitimated him under the laws of any state during this time period. We note that the burden is on the respondent, who was born in Panama, to establish his citizenship. For reasons discussed above, we find that the respondent has not met his burden. We therefore decline to reopen these proceedings. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: AHMAD HAMZE REDA
File: AXX XX7 299 - Detroit
March 15, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tamara French, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on August 24, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s December 15, 2004, decision denying his motion to reopen. Previously on July 20, 2004, the Immigration Judge considered the respondent’s sole application for relief in the form of voluntary departure and granted such relief pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), but required that the respondent depart by November 17, 2004. On November 28, 2006, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen in order to apply for adjustment of status based on an approved I-130 immigrant petition filed by his United States citizen wife. The motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, given that we previously dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s December 15, 2004, decsion1 due to the respondent’s failure to present a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, our August 24, 2005, decision remains the final administrative order. See Matter of L-V-K-, 22 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1999) (stating that an administrative decision becomes final when the Board reaches a decision on appeal); see also Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Further, as the respondent failed to file his current motion within 90 days of our prior decision, his motion is untimely. Also, as the respondent previously filed a motion to reopen in these proceedings, he is barred by the numerical limitations for a motion to reopen. See sections 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7) (stating that a party may file only one motion to reopen, and that such a motion must be filed within 90 days following the date of the final administrative decision); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
Even considering the respondent’s current motion, which is primarily based upon suffering ineffective assistance by his former attorney, Mr. Terence Hoerman, we do not find that the respondent complied with the procedural requirements for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel.2 The respondent alleges, inter alia, that his previous counsel provided ineffective assistance given that the prior motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge “lack¿edº substance, fail¿edº to comply with all ¿theº requirements of Matter of Lozada, and lack¿edº his application for relief” (Respondent’s Motion at 5-9). The respondent also alleges that he was prejudiced by his former attorney’s actions given that Mr. Hoerman “failed to file a timely motion” to the Immigration Court and provided him with inaccurate advice (Respondent’s Motion at 8). We note, however, that while the respondent submitted a complaint to the Michigan Attorney Grievance Commission (MAGC) regarding Mr. Hoerman’s alleged misconduct (Respondent’s Motion at Tab H) — which was ultimately dismissed, as discussed below — there is no evidence that the respondent conveyed such information to Mr. Hoerman himself. Rather, while the respondent states that he “mailed his complaint to the ¿MAGCº who in turn mailed it to Mr. Hoerman” (Respondent’s Motion at 8), he has failed to provide any case law or other legal authority stating that a State Bar’s correspondence to the impugned attorney is a sufficient substitute for directly informing the attorney of the alleged misconduct. See Matter of Assaad, supra, at 556 (“the alien must inform counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance and give him or her the opportunity to respond”); see also Scorteanu v. INS, 339 F.3d 407, 414 (6th Cir. 2003) (“Scorteanu needed only to notify former attorney Muresan of the charge of ineffective assistance of counsel.”). Thus, as the respondent has not explained why he chose to rely on the MAGC to inform Mr. Hoerman of the complaint, rather than contacting Mr. Hoerman directly, he has not met the criteria of demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Notwithstanding the respondent’s failure to satisfy the aforementioned procedural requirements, we find that he has not demonstrated prejudice by his former counsel’s representation. See Allabani v. Gonzales, 402 F.3d 668, 677-78 (6th Cir. 2005). The record shows that the MAGC — after investigating the respondent’s charges against Mr. Hoerman — issued a decision on August 24, 2006, concluding that Mr. Hoerman’s actions, as alleged by the respondent, did not constitute professional misconduct (Respondent’s Motion at Tab J). Moreover, the respondent fails to show any error in the MAGC’s decision, nor does he reconcile its conclusion with his continued allegations of ineffective assistance regarding Mr. Hoerman’s representation (Respondent’s Motion at 5). See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638; see also Denko v. INS, supra, at 723-24 (“A party must prove prejudice by alleging facts that permit the court to infer that competent counsel would have acted otherwise.”) (quoting Taniguchi v. Schultz, 303 F.3d 950, 958 (9th Cir. 2002)).3 Further, the fact that the respondent is now dissatisfied with Mr. Hoerman’s strategy in pursuing relief suggests that he is disappointed in his tactical decisions rather than the substance of his representation. As we have previously held, complaints based on specific techniques in pursuing relief are not grounds for reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998). Thus, based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion does not clearly demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s representation.
 
In addition, we are unpersuaded by the respondent’s argument that he merits equitable tolling of the time and number limitations for his current motion to reopen (Respondent’s Motion at 9-11). Specifically, given that the respondent has not presented a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as discussed above, any argument requesting that the time or numeric limitations for reopening be equitably tolled is unavailing. See generally Harchenko v. INS, 379 F.3d 405, 409-10 (6th Cir. 2004). The respondent also alleges that he was prevented from filing the instant motion until an error committed by the Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS, formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) — in processing the respondent’s wife’s I-130 petition — was corrected, thereby resulting in his failure to meet the time limitation for filing a motion to reopen (Respondent’s Motion at 9-11; Tab D). However, we need not address the significance of the DHS’s error as allegedly causing a delay in the respondent’s filing of the current motion given that he does not meaningfully address his violation of the numerical limitations described above, or demonstrate that reopening would be warranted except for the DHS’s processing error (Respondent’s Br. at 9-11). See Scorteanu v. INS, supra, at 413 (“this court need not decide” whether equitable tolling should apply given the petitioner’s failure “to prove entitlement to equitable relief”). To the extent that the respondent argues that he was denied due process as a result of the aforementioned errors by the DHS and his former attorneys (Respondent’ s Motion at 11-12), we first note that the Board has no jurisdiction over the applications and matters considered by the DHS. Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated how he was denied fundamental fairness in these removal proceedings. See id. (“The alien must prove that ineffective assistance of counsel resulted in prejudice or denial of fundamental fairness in order to prove a denial of due process.”): Rather, the record shows that he had ample opportunities to demonstrate ineffective assistance regarding his previous attorneys, but that all such complaints were found to be meritless. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640 (“The respondent received a full and fair hearing at which he was given every opportunity to present his case.”).
 
*3 To the extent that the respondent seeks a stay of removal (Respondent’s Motion at 10), we note that he has not shown why the execution of his removal order should be stayed and accordingly deny his motion in this regard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(f). Finally, we find that the circumstances presented in the respondent’s motion are not “exceptional” as to justify a sua sponte reopening of the matter. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
Roger A. Pauley
FOR THE BOARD
Footnotes

1

The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, which was filed on November 12, 2004, on three grounds based on the respondent’s (1) untimely filing of the motion, (2) failure to comply with the motion to reopen requirements, including his failure to provide any application for relief or supporting evidence, (3) failure to comply with the procedural requirements for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel. See I.J.’s December 15, 2004, decision.

2

We have held that a motion to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639-40. In addition to complying with the procedural requirements, a respondent must also show that “he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance.” See id. at 638; Denko v. INS, 351 F.3d 717 (6th Cir. 2003).

3

Additionally, we note that the MAGC twice dismissed the respondent’s complaints regarding the alleged ineffective assistance of a prior attorney, Mr. James Hoare (Respondent’s Motion at Tabs L, M), whose supposed misconduct, the respondent now argues, was not adequately presented by Mr. Hoerman. Specifically, in a decision dated September 29, 2004, the MAGC found the respondent’s allegations against Mr. Hoare to be insufficient to warrant further proceedings — a conclusion that was reaffirmed in its May 24, 2006, decision—while stating that a “failure to achieve a ¿successfulº result” is not “by itself, evidence of misconduct” (Respondent’s Motion at Tabs L, M).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Laura L. Lichter, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent has filed a motion seeking to have the Board reopen his proceedings sua sponte. The motion, not opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), will be granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
These proceedings were last before us on July 14, 2005, at which time we denied the respondent’s timely motion to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.1 While we found, therein, that the respondent had met the procedural requirements pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we ultimately found that we had no jurisdiction to allow the respondent to seek recourse before the DHS for any alleged ineffective assistance he provided in seeking the respondent’s visa petition. Prior to this July 14, 2005, decision, we also found, on January 26, 2005, that the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s July 25, 2003, decision was without merit; specifically, we found that the respondent’s request for a continuance to adjudicate his third visa petition was without good cause due to the fact that the evidence indicated that the underlying marriage was not bona fide.
 
As the respondent explains in his current motion, the basis of his prior ineffective assistance of counsel motion, the basis of the Immigration Judge’s 2003 denial of his adjustment claim and our dismissal of his appeal therefrom, and the ongoing denial of his continuance requests, all involve a finding that the respondent’s first visa petition involved fraud (Tr. at 18-19). As the respondent explained at his 2003 hearing, and in numerous subsequent briefs, a fraudulent birth certificate was filed with this petition without his knowledge. Subsequently, the respondent explained that his prior counsel failed to address this fraud in his request to approve a second petition.2 Notwithstanding his inability to properly explain the circumstances surrounding this first fraudulent visa petition, the adjudication of his adjustment of status application was continually pretermitted due to the correct assumption that he would be barred from an approved visa petition due to section 204(c) of the Act.
 
In his current motion, the respondent has submitted evidence that his third visa petition has been approved, notwithstanding the bar set forth at section 204(c) of the Act. While no evidence exists in the record save the respondent’s approval notice, and we are aware that the respondent still must demonstrate eligibility for relief as a matter of discretion, the respondent has now demonstrated prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. We previously found that the respondent had met the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, and his claim therein involved the events surrounding his first visa petition, we believe it appropriate to provide the respondent the opportunity to present his case before the Immigration Judge.
 
*2 Accordingly, we will reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). On remand to the Immigration Judge the respondent will have an opportunity to present his application for adjustment of status, including his worthiness for such relief as a matter of discretion. The DHS shall have the opportunity to examine and verify the validity of the respondent’s submissions and present evidence.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN RE: GUILLERMO LENIN GARCIA MONTENEGRO
File: A97 955 387 - Miami
March 12, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rick Hujber, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on October 12, 2006, because he failed to appear for his hearing. He requested reopening with an Immigration Judge on November 2, 2006, but the Immigration Judge denied the motion on November 6, 2006. On December 6, 2006, the respondent requested reconsideration with the Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on December 7, 2006. On December 12, 2006, the respondent requested that the Immigration Judge reopen these proceedings sua sponte. Therein, the respondent argued that his former counsel did not inform him of the October 12, 2006, hearing date. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on December 14, 2006, and this appeal followed. The record will be remanded.
 
The respondent argues on appeal and in his remand request that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. In addition, we note that the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals requires substantial if not exact compliance with the procedural requirements set forth above. See Dakane v.

In addition, the record contains a statement from the respondent’s former counsel, Jorge Rivera, that was provided on appeal. Therein, Mr. Rivera admits that his former employee, Joseph Lackey, Esquire, was handling the respondent’s case, and did not notify the respondent of the hearing scheduled for October 12, 2006. Based on this information, we find that the respondent’s failure to appear for his hearing was caused by ineffective representation of counsel. We further note that the respondent is married to a United States citizen, she has filed a visa petition on his behalf, and the respondent has diligently sought reopening of these proceedings. Based on these factors, we find that an exceptional situation exists herein to warrant sua sponte reopening of proceedings in the exercise of discretion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rick Hujber, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on October 12, 2006, because he failed to appear for his hearing. He requested reopening with an Immigration Judge on November 2, 2006, but the Immigration Judge denied the motion on November 6, 2006. On December 6, 2006, the respondent requested reconsideration with the Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on December 7, 2006. On December 12, 2006, the respondent requested that the Immigration Judge reopen these proceedings sua sponte. Therein, the respondent argued that his former counsel did not inform him of the October 12, 2006, hearing date. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on December 14, 2006, and this appeal followed. The record will be remanded.
 
The respondent argues on appeal and in his remand request that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. In addition, we note that the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals requires substantial if not exact compliance with the procedural requirements set forth above. See Dakane v. U.S. Atty.Gen., 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005); Gbaya v. U.S. Atty.Gen., 342 F.3d 1219 (11th Cir. 2003).
 
It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: JOSE GUADALUPE SOSA-RODRIGUEZ
File: AXX XX1 398 - San Diego
March 6, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Catalina Leff, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal is untimely. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 Calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was rendered orally on January 5, 2007. The appeal was accordingly due on or before February 5, 2007. The record reflects, however, that the Notice of Appeal was mailed after the due date and filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on February 12, 2007.
 
The respondent urges the Board to accept the appeal out of time. The respondent, through current counsel, states that he was under the impression that his former attorney would file his appeal before the due date. However, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). As for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, Matter of Lozada, supra, requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002). No evidence has been submitted in support of the motion submitted on the respondent’s behalf by current counsel.
 
We find that the appeal is untimely. The Immigration Judge’s decision is accordingly now final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15 (1999).
 
We note that because we have dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J- J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: MAHMOOD SHAFIEE
File: AXX XX7 368 - Phoenix
March 2, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert B. Jobe, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sandra B. Miles
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude (withdrawn)
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before the Board on July 20, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion to remand. On October 18, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion will be granted.
 
As an initial matter, we disagree with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) that the respondent’s motion is untimely and number-barred, as his previous motion was deemed to be a motion to remand filed during the pendency of his second appeal, and the final administrative order was issued on July 20, 2006. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4).
 
Moreover, the respondent reasserts the claim that he is not removable as charged, and he now asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his former attorney for conceding removability. The respondent avers that “to the best of my knowledge I never discussed with ¿former counselº the issue of my removability and how they should plead to the charges” (Motion, attachment A). The attorney, in his response, does remember discussing this strategy with the respondent, and states that the respondent “had no interest in contesting the charges and wanted a final merit hearing to request relief as soon as possible” (Motion, attachment V). However, a client’s insistence on expediting a case is no excuse for failing to research and advise a client that there is no sound basis for the charges. A concession of removability under these circumstances cannot be considered a reasonable tactical decision. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (holding that absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made before, during, or even after a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity binds his client as a judicial admission; and that there is a strong presumption that such a decision is a reasonable tactical decision).
 
The respondent has satisfied the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Furthermore, he has submitted sufficient evidence that he was prejudiced by his counsel’s actions, as it appears that his 1985 conviction under California Penal Code § 273a(a) for child endangerment does not constitute a crime involving moral turpitude. See People v. Sanders, 10 Cal. App. 4th 1268, 1274 (5th Dist. 1992); see also Carty v. Ashcroft, 395 F.3d 1081, 1084 (9th Cir. 2005) (holding that when a statute is divisible into several crimes, some of which may involve moral turpitude and some not, it is appropriate to examine the “record of conviction” to determine which part applies to the defendant). Accordingly, the motion will be granted, proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
