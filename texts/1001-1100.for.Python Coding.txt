IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL/MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Olga Nazimova, Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
J. Grant
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on November 2, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s April 5, 2005, decision to denying his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order entered in his case on April 1, 2003, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and lack of notice, for lack of jurisdiction.1 See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent petitioned for review of our decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises. Pursuant to that court’s order dated August 10, 2006, remanding the case to the Board, we will vacate our decision dated November 2, 2005, rescind the Immigration Judge’s April 1, 2003, in absentia order in this matter, and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
 
Upon further review, we find that pursuant to the decisional authority of the Ninth Circuit, the Immigration Judge was not “without jurisdiction” to consider the respondent’s motion under the particular circumstances presented in this case, despite the language in the regulations2 seeming to preclude consideration of a motion filed by an alien after his deportation from the United States. See Lin v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 979, 981-982 (9th Cir. 2007) (where the court recently held that the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), prohibiting an alien who departs the U.S. from filing a motion to reopen deportation proceedings only applies to a person who departs the U.S. while he or she is the subject of pending deportation proceedings and does not apply in a case where the proceedings have been completed.); see also Cardoso-Tlaseca v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir 2006) (reaffirming the court’s holding in Wiedersperg v. INS, 896 F.2d 1179 (9th Cir. 1990) (court found that the regulatory bar to consideration by the Board of a deportation order after the alien departed the United States applied only if the departure was legally executed)); Thorsteinsson v. INS, 724 F.2d 1365, 1367 (9th Cir. 1983) (referring to its decision in Mendez v. INS, 563 F.2d 956, 958 (9th Cir. 1977), wherein it recognized that a departure in contravention of due process” was not a “legally executed departure,” precluding further review.).
 
Furthermore, we find the record strongly suggests a case of ineffective assistance by the respondent’s former counsel. See Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 587 (9th Cir. 2006) (recognizing that “¿bºecause due process requires more than the formal availability of counsel,” the court “held that an alien is denied due process when his attorney provides ineffective assistance.”). Therefore, despite the respondent’s failure to meet the formal requirements set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), we find that on the face of the record before us, there has been substantial compliance with the rule, and the respondent has presented a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See also Lara-Torres v. Ashcrofi, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
*2 Therefore, in accordance with the decisional authority of the Ninth Circuit set forth above, as the record supports the respondent’s contention that he was denied due process and a fair hearing due to the ineffective assistance of his former counsel and lack of notice3 of the scheduled hearing, a departure in execution of an order of deportation entered pursuant to those proceedings, was a “departure in contravention of due process” and not a “legally executed departure,” and does not preclude our favorable consideration of the respondent’s request to reopen the proceedings. See Mendez v. INS, supra at 958; see also Cardoso-Tlaseca v. Gonzales, supra; Wiedersperg v. INS, supra. Furthermore, as the respondent was no longer the subject of pending deportation proceedings at the time he filed his motion with the Immigration Judge, he was not precluded under the regulations from having the motion considered solely because it had been filed after his deportation from the United States. See Lin v. Gonzales, supra at 981-982 (the regulatory bar to consideration by the Board of a deportation order after the alien departed the United States does not apply in a case where the proceedings have been completed).
 
Accordingly, pursuant to the Ninth Circuit’s August 10, 2006, remand order, and upon further consideration of the issues presented therein, the following orders will be entered:
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated November 2, 2005, is vacated, and the Immigration Judge’s April 1, 2003, in absentia order of deportation in this matter, is rescinded.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

The record reflects the Board in a decision dated February 5, 2003, had remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), as well as for consideration of new evidence presented in support of his claim of United States citizenship. However, on remand, in a decision dated April 1, 2003, the Immigration Judge entered an in absentia order of deportation due to the respondent’s failure to appear for his scheduled hearing. The record reveals the respondent was deported from the United States on October 16, 2003, pursuant to that order.

The regulations provide, in relevant part, that “¿aº motion to reopen or to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal proceedings, deportation, or exclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).

IN RE: YOUNG HAE CHUNG
File: AXX XX8 147 - Los Angeles
March 1, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sunmin Lee, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals the decision of an Immigration Judge entered on November 16, 2005, decision. The appeal, to which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded, will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a citizen of the South Korea, was charged with being present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. At a November 16, 2005, hearing, counsel indicated that the respondent desired adjustment of status based on her marriage to a United States citizen. The respondent’s motion for administrative closure was denied. At the November 16, 2005, hearing, current counsel sought only voluntary departure under 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a) (Tr. at 10). After consultation with the respondent, off the record, counsel confirmed that pre-conclusion voluntary departure was being sought and waived appeal (Tr. at 11-14). See Matter of Ocampo, 22 I&N Dec. 1301 (BIA 2000)(grant of voluntary departure prior to completion of removal proceeding, under Section 240B(a) of the Act, requires an express waiver of the right to appeal); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i).
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(G) (summary dismissal of appeal appropriate where appeal is barred based on waiver of right to appeal).
 
The respondent suggests that her waiver was invalid. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001) (a party wishing to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or an appeal directly with the Board). She argues that she received ineffective assistance from her former counsel, that she was told to just say “yes” to everything, and that she did not know that she was waiving the right to appeal or agreeing to depart voluntarily. However, in this case, we note that the respondent was not forced to seek pre-hearing voluntary departure, which requires an appeal waiver. Rather, counsel sought such relief on her behalf, and waived the right to appeal (Tr. at 11-14). The respondent fails to show that she was coerced into accepting pre-hearing voluntary departure or was inhibited from seeking any viable form of relief from removal. She has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Matter of Lozada, supra, requires that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he or she was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002). The respondent has provided no affidavit setting forth the agreement with her former counsel, has not shown that her former attorney has been given the opportunity to respond to the allegations, and has not filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority.
 
*2 We therefore lack jurisdiction over this case. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.52, 1240.53, and 1241.31 (1999).

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eleanor J. Tschugunov, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Victoria A. Christian
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N ACt ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; voluntary departure; remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. At her hearing before the Immigration Judge on March 16, 2001, the respondent waived her right to appeal and accepted a period of pre-conclusionary voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a) (Tr. at 12-13). We find that the Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(2)(G). However, even assuming arguendo that we have jurisdiction in this case, the respondent is ineligible for relief from removal because she remained in the United States beyond the date authorized for voluntary departure after receiving oral and written warnings of the consequences of her failure to depart from both the Immigration Judge and this Board (I.J. at 10). See section 240B(d)(1)(B) of the Act. Contrary to the respondent’s arguments on appeal, the Board lacks authority to apply an “exceptional circumstances” or other general equitable exception to the penalty provisions for her failure to depart within the time period afforded for voluntary departure. See Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87 (BIA 2007). Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand the record for further proceedings based upon her claim that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the respondent’s motion does not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Among other things, Matter of Lozada requires that an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel file a complaint against the allegedly-ineffective attorney or provide an adequate explanation for failing to file such a complaint. In her motion, the respondent notes that she has not filed a bar complaint against her former attorney because “this case does not involve failure on the part of the prior counsel with respect to ethical or legal responsibilities; rather the complaint goes to prior counsel’s failure to timely notify the ¿Boardº of an additional basis for relief” (Motion to Remand at 3). For the reasons stated in Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996), we find the respondent’s explanation for her failure to file a bar complaint against her former counsel to be inadequate. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Munawar H. Sandhu, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On January 20, 2006, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent pre-conclusion voluntary departure, noting that the respondent had waived the right to appeal. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). The respondent filed Form EOIR-26 on February 14, 2006, asserting that his former attorney did not properly guide him and asked him to accept voluntary departure despite his marriage to a United States citizen.
 
The record reveals that the respondent initially made some equivocal comments when he was questioned about the withdrawal of the application for adjustment of status (Tr. at 53) and that the Immigration Judge allowed the respondent to consult off the record with his attorney, stating that the respondent’s withdrawal of the application and acceptance of voluntary departure had to be knowing and voluntary (Tr. at 53-54). Thereafter, the respondent personally responded to questioning stating that he was making the decision to withdraw the application for adjustment of status of his own free will after consultation with his attorney and that he had also made the decision to accept a final order of voluntary departure after consultation with his attorney and that no one had forced him to make that decision (Tr. at 55).
 
The respondent now essentially claims that former counsel pressured him into withdrawing his application for adjustment of status and waiving his right to appeal. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001) (a party wishing to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or an appeal directly with the Board). However, despite making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988)), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making such a claim. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Hamid v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 465, 469 (6th Cir. 2003). These cases require that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, an alien must show that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. In this case, the respondent has submitted no affidavit and the statements in the Form EOIR-26 do not show that the attorney has been allowed to respond. There is also no allegation or showing that a bar complaint has been filed. Consequently, we conclude that he has not shown that the waiver of the appeal was due to ineffective assistance of his former counsel.
 
*2 After review of the transcript, we find that the respondent made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal. Thus, the Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Shih, supra. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

IN RE BOZENA ZMIJEWSKA, RESPONDENT
FILE A70 576 279 - NEW YORK
Decided February 21, 2007
**1 *87 (1) The Board of Immigration Appeals lacks authority to apply an “exceptional circumstances” or other general equitable exception to the penalty provisions for failure to depart within the time period afforded for voluntary departure under section 240B(d)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.A. § 1229c(d)(1) (West Supp. 2006).
 
(2) An alien has not voluntarily failed to depart the United States under section 240B(d)(1) of the Act when the alien, through no fault of his or her own, was unaware of the voluntary departure order or was physically unable to depart within the time granted.
 
FOR RESPONDENT:
Ruchi Thaker, Esquire
New York, New York
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY:
Michael Horowitz,
Assistant Chief Counsel
BEFORE: Board Panel: HURWITZ, Acting Vice Chairman; HOLMES and GRANT, Board Members.
GRANT, Board Member:
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has remanded this case with a request that we clarify whether, under section 240B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c (2000), “Congress intended to permit courts, in the exercise of their equitable discretion, to grant exceptions to the 10-year ineligibility period imposed as a penalty for failure to comply with voluntary departure orders.” Zmijewska v. Gonzales, 426 F.3d 99, 101 (2d Cir. 2005).
 
The court further requested that we reconsider the respondent’s claims “in light of the Government’s revelation at oral argument that [her] voluntary departure deadline was in fact November 8, 2002, rather than November 9, 2002, and therefore that [her] Board-accredited representative had not informed her of the existence of the BIA’s voluntary departure order by the time her departure deadline passed.” Id. at 100-01.
 
As discussed below, Congress has provided certain exceptions to the penalties for overstaying a period of voluntary departure. The statute now limits application of the penalty provisions to situations in which a respondent *88 “voluntarily fails to depart the United States within the time period specified.” Section 240B(d)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.A. § 1229c(d)(1) (West Supp. 2006) (emphasis added). Thus, assuming the truth of the respondent’s allegations regarding her accredited representative’s delay in informing her of our voluntary departure order, we find that the respondent did not voluntarily fail to depart within the period for voluntary departure. We will therefore vacate our prior decision denying the respondent’s motions to reopen and reconsider, grant her motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status, and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
  
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
**2 The respondent entered the United States in July 1988 and remained beyond the 6 months authorized by her visitor’s visa. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”), now the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), initiated removal proceedings in September 1999.
 
Assisted by an accredited representative, the respondent conceded in Immigration Court that she was subject to removal for staying beyond the period authorized by her nonimmigrant visa. In a decision dated June 13, 2000, the Immigration Judge pretermitted her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1) (2000), for lack of a qualifying relative. In addition, because the respondent’s pending request for a labor certification had not yet been approved, the Immigration Judge found her ineligible for adjustment of status and any other relief from removal other than voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge issued an order granting the respondent 60 days for voluntary departure from the United States, with an alternate order of removal to Poland. The Immigration Judge also instructed the respondent that if she failed to depart within the time afforded, she would be barred from relief from removal “unless there were exceptional circumstances beyond [her] control as to why [she] didn’t comply with that order of voluntary departure such as being very sick or someone dying in [her] family or some other type of exceptional circumstance.”
 
The respondent timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s pretermission of her request for cancellation of removal. On October 9, 2002, we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal and granted her 30 days for voluntary departure.
 
On January 7, 2003, after learning that her appeal had been dismissed and obtaining new counsel, the respondent filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance by her former representative for failing to seek a remand for adjustment of status while her appeal was pending with the Board and for failing to notify her of the Board’s decision until after the period we granted her for voluntary departure had passed. The respondent attached to her motion to reopen an approved labor certification and an approved employment *89 visa petition. The relevant Visa Bulletins indicate that visas with the respondent’s priority date were available for the respondent’s employment category in March 2002.
 
On April 29, 2003, we denied the motion to reopen. We found that the motion was untimely and, alternatively, that the respondent, as a consequence of overstaying our grant of voluntary departure, was ineligible for adjustment of status under the 10-year bar in section 240B of the Act. We also rejected the respondent’s claim that “exceptional circumstances” excused her from the 10-year bar, finding that although such an exception was included in former section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b (1994), a respondent in removal proceedings instituted on or after April 1, 1997, is subject to the terms of section 240B which, unlike former section 242B, does not contain an “exceptional circumstances” exception for failing to comply with a voluntary departure order.
 
**3 The respondent then filed a timely motion for reconsideration, pointing out that we had erred in finding that the motion to reopen was untimely and requesting that we recognize an exception to the voluntary departure penalty when failure to depart within the time provided is the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. On September 26, 2003, we issued a decision acknowledging that the motion to reopen had been timely filed but denying reconsideration on the basis that “[t]he prior decision found that under section 240B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c, the respondent had not shown ‘exceptional circumstances’ for her failure to comply with the voluntary departure order.”
 
The respondent appealed both the denial of the motion to reopen and the denial of the motion to reconsider to the Second Circuit. In its remand to the Board, the court framed the issue as follows:
The question presented is whether, in light of 8 U.S.C. § 1229c, [the respondent’s] failure to comply with a voluntary departure order renders her statutorily ineligible to receive an adjustment of status arising out of an employment offer, see 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), or whether [she] may instead seek equitable relief from the provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d) in the extraordinary circumstances presented here-namely, where: (1) [she] relied on erroneous representations of an immigration agent advising her not to seek adjustment of status after receiving a labor certification but prior to the BIA’s order of voluntary departure; (2) [her] Board-accredited representative failed to notify her of the existence of the BIA’s voluntary removal order until the day after she was required to depart the United States; and (3) an Immigration Judge (“IJ”) informed (or misinformed) [the respondent] on the record that even if she failed to depart voluntarily in accordance with a BIA order, she still could avoid becoming statutorily ineligible for further relief by demonstrating that “there were exceptional circumstances beyond [her] control.”

*90 II. ANALYSIS
  
A. Statutory Language
 
We begin with the statutory language of the penalty provisions for failing to depart within the time afforded for voluntary departure. Penalties for failing to depart pursuant to a grant of voluntary departure were first imposed in 1990 with the enactment of section 545(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978, 5061, 5064 (effective Nov. 29, 1990). The statute, which was codified at former section 242B(e)(2)(A) of the Act, provided, in relevant part:
**4 [A]ny alien … who remains in the United States after the scheduled date of departure, other than because of exceptional circumstances, shall not be eligible for relief described in paragraph (5) [including adjustment of status] for a period of 5 years after the scheduled date of departure or the date of unlawful reentry, respectively.
 
(Emphasis added.) The initial penalty provision thus contained an “exceptional circumstances” exception for failing to depart within the allotted time. The term “exceptional circumstances” was defined to include “exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” Former section 242B(f)(2)of the Act. The statute also required written notice in English and Spanish and oral notice in a language the alien understands of the consequences of failing to depart within the time afforded, other than because of exceptional circumstances. Former section 242B(e)(2)(B) of the Act.
 
In 1996, Congress amended the penalty provision for failure to depart pursuant to a grant of voluntary departure in a number of ways. See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Div. C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, § 304(a)(3), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-587, 3009-596, (“IIRIRA”). Most significantly, the IIRIRA eliminated the “exceptional circumstances” exception. It also added a new clause specifying that the penalties apply to an alien who “fails voluntarily to depart.”1 Id. § 304(a)(3), 110 Stat. at 3009-597. The newly enacted section of the statute regarding penalties for failure to depart provided as follows:
If an alien is permitted to depart voluntarily under this section and fails voluntarily to depart the United States within the time period specified, the alien shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under this section and sections 240A,  *91 245, 248, and 249. The order permitting the alien to depart voluntarily shall inform the alien of the penalties under this subsection.
 
Section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d) (2000) (emphasis added). We have never directly addressed in a precedent decision the meaning of the phrase “fails voluntarily to depart the United States” contained in section 240B(d).
 
In January 2006, after the Second Circuit remanded this case, Congress amended section 240B(d) of the Act to make two changes relevant to the voluntary departure penalty provision. See Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-162, § 812, 119 Stat. 2960, 3057 (enacted Jan. 5, 2006) (“VAWA”). Section 240B(d) of the Act now provides as follows:
  
Civil Penalty for Failure to Depart
  
(1) In General
 
**5 Subject to paragraph (2), if an alien is permitted to depart voluntarily under this section and voluntarily fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, the alien —
(A) shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000; and
 
(B) shall be ineligible, for a period of 10 years, to receive any further relief under this section and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249.
 
 
  
(2) Application of VAWA Protections
 
The restrictions on relief under paragraph (1) shall not apply to relief under section 240A or 245 on the basis of a petition filed by a VAWA self-petitioner, or a petition filed under section 240A(b)(2), or under section 244(a)(3) (as in effect prior to March 31, 1977), if the extreme cruelty or battery was at least one central reason for the alien’s overstaying the grant of voluntary departure.
 
  
(3) Notice of Penalties
 
The order permitting an alien to depart voluntarily shall inform the alien of the penalties under this subsection.
 
 
In enacting the 2006 amendments, Congress recognized that some VAWA applicants may have overstayed a period of voluntary departure for reasons that justify an exception to the penalty provisions. Notably, the VAWA exception is limited to applicants who demonstrate that extreme cruelty or battery was a central reason for overstaying the grant of voluntary departure. Congress also changed the wording of the introductory clause of section 240B(d) from “fails voluntarily to depart” to “voluntarily fails to depart.” This change in wording clarifies that the phrase was not intended to apply to every alien who failed to depart within the voluntary departure period but was meant to limit the penalties to only those aliens whose failure to depart was voluntary.
  
*92 B. Equitable Exceptions to the Voluntary Departure Penalty Provisions
 
Before reaching the question whether the respondent in this case “voluntarily” failed to depart, we must first address the issue presented on remand, i.e., whether courts may exercise equitable discretion to grant exceptions to the penalty provisions of section 240B(d). We understand that the court’s request requires us to consider whether the statute may be interpreted to afford agency and court authority to recognize equitable exceptions, in addition to the exceptions spelled out in the statute. For the reasons specified below, we find that Congress has not given the Board or the courts authority to recognize equitable exceptions to the section 240B(d) bar beyond those specifically provided in the voluntary departure provisions.
 
The question of equitable exceptions to the voluntary departure penalties involves considerations somewhat different from those relevant to the question of equitable exceptions to statutes of limitations. See Iavorski v. U.S. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 129 (2d Cir. 2000). Unlike a statute of limitations, the voluntary departure grant involves a quid pro quo arrangement between an alien and the Government of the United States. Banda-Ortiz v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 387, 389 (5th Cir. 2006) (“Voluntary departure is the result of an agreed-upon exchange of benefits between an alien and the Government.”)In return for departing within the time afforded for voluntary departure, an alien avoids certain adverse consequences of a removal order. See, e.g., section 212(a)(9)(A)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(A)(ii) (2000)(rendering inadmissible for 10 years an alien who has been ordered removed from the United States.) The voluntary departure agreement comes with warnings of the consequences of failing to depart within the time granted.2 Therefore, exceptions to the penalty provisions, unlike exceptions to a statute of limitation, are included in the statutory framework setting forth the terms of the agreement.
 
**6 In the original version of the statute, Congress afforded a rather broad and open-ended equitable exception to the penalty provisions for aliens who could demonstrate “exceptional circumstances,” which was defined to include “serious illness” and other “compelling circumstances.” See, e.g., Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996) (finding that ineffective assistance of counsel may amount to “exceptional circumstances” in the context of a motion to reopen an in absentia removal order).
 
*93 The congressional repeal of the “exceptional circumstances” exception to the voluntary departure penalty soon after our decision in Matter of Grijalva, supra, and its replacement with a “voluntariness” test strongly suggest that Congress did not intend to allow the Board and the courts to create and apply a set of equitable exceptions that would amount to a substitute version of the repealed “exceptional circumstances” exception. Notably, at the same time that Congress repealed the “exceptional circumstances” exception for voluntary departure penalties, it left intact the same exception for rescission of in absentia orders of removal for failure to appear. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C) (2000). Additionally, the wording of the recently enacted VAWA exception, which requires extreme cruelty or battery to be “a central reason” for a VAWA applicant’s failure to depart, indicates that Congress intended to limit the exceptions to the penalties for failure to depart to those situations specifically described in the statute, i.e., the “voluntariness” provision and the VAWA exception.
 
Given the contractual nature of the voluntary departure agreement, the specificity of the exceptions to the penalty provision now provided by Congress, and the amendments to the statute, most particularly the repeal of the more general “exceptional circumstances” exception, we find that Congress intended to foreclose the Board and the courts from applying an open-ended equitable exception to the penalties for failing to depart within the time for voluntary departure.3
  
C. Application of the “Voluntariness” Exception
 
We now turn to the question whether the respondent “voluntarily” failed to depart within the period afforded for voluntary departure. The term “voluntarily” ordinarily refers to conduct that is “brought about of one’s own accord or by free choice.” The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1600 (unabridged ed. 1973). Congress has used the phrase “voluntarily fails” in a number of provisions. See, e.g., 10 U.S.C.A. § 2192a(e) (West Supp. 2006) (a participant who “voluntarily fails” to complete a Department of Defense education program shall provide a refund to the United States in an appropriate amount); 20 U.S.C.A. § 1927(a)(3)(West 2005) (an individual who “voluntarily fails” to complete a term of service with the Capitol police must repay recruitment and relocation bonus *94 on a pro rata basis); 22 U.S.C. § 3657(c)(2) (2000) (an employee who “voluntarily fails” to complete the required period of employment must repay recruitment and retention bonuses). In each instance, the phrase “voluntarily fails” refers to a failure to complete an act or requirement within the actor’s control. See Favreau v. United States, 317 F.3d 1346 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (approving recoupment of enlistment bonuses when service members were unable to meet obesity and physical fitness requirements by examining the voluntariness of the underlying conduct of the employee, rather than the voluntariness of termination). Under the terms of section 240B(d) of the Act, a respondent who, through no fault of her own, remains unaware of the grant of voluntary departure until after the period for voluntary departure has expired cannot be said to have “voluntarily” failed to depart within the period of voluntary departure.
 
**7 We emphasize that the “voluntariness” exception is not a substitute for the repealed “exceptional circumstances” exception. It is a much narrower exception limited to situations in which an alien, through no fault of his or her own, is unaware of the voluntary departure order or is physically unable to depart. It would not include situations in which departure within the period granted would involve exceptional hardships to the alien or close family members. Nor would lack of funds for departure be considered an involuntary failure to depart.
 
The respondent claims that she did not depart the United States within the 30-day period for voluntary departure because her accredited representative failed to inform her of our October 9, 2002, order until after the expiration of her voluntary departure period. When she learned of the order on day 31, she also learned that she had become eligible for adjustment of status during the course of her appeal and could have sought a remand for adjustment of status several months before we issued our decision dismissing her appeal and granting voluntary departure.
 
Ordinarily, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be supported by (1) an affidavit setting out the agreement entered into with counsel, (2) proof that notice of the allegations and an opportunity to respond has been provided to counsel whose representation was allegedly ineffective, and (3) the filing of a complaint with appropriate disciplinary authorities or an explanation for the failure to file a complaint. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In this case, the respondent was represented by an accredited representative, not an attorney. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1292.1(a)(4), 1292.2(d) (2006). During the course of her appeal, the respondent submitted a copy of a formal complaint provided to her accredited representative and apparently offered him an opportunity to respond. Although we have not yet decided the question whether the Lozada requirements should be strictly applied to an accredited representative, we find *95 that the steps taken by the respondent in this case satisfy the concerns underlying the Lozada requirements.4
 
Assuming the truth of the respondent’s allegations regarding her accredited representative’s conduct, we find that she has shown that she did not “voluntarily” fail to depart within the period of voluntary departure granted by the Board.5 In addition, the respondent in this case was erroneously instructed by the Immigration Judge that the penalty provisions would not apply in the event that she could demonstrate exceptional circumstances for having failed to depart within the time afforded.6 At the time the respondent learned that she had overstayed the 30-day period of voluntary departure granted by the Board, she could reasonably have believed that the ineffective assistance of her accredited representative, and her apparent eligibility for adjustment of status during the course of the appeal, could satisfy an exceptional circumstances exception. See, e.g., Matter of Grijalva, supra (holding that ineffective assistance of counsel that causes an alien to fail to appear for a hearing may amount to “exceptional circumstances” within the meaning of former section 242B(f)(2) of the Act).
 
**8 Finally, we find that the respondent acted with due diligence in locating new counsel and filing a timely motion to reopen proceedings within 2 months of learning of our order dismissing her appeal and of her eligibility for adjustment of status in removal proceedings. We will therefore vacate our prior decisions denying the respondent’s motion to reopen and motion to reconsider, grant the motion to reopen, and remand the proceedings to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The October 9, 2002, and April 29, 2003, decisions of the Board are vacated.
 
*96 FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

The IIRIRA also increased the period of ineligibility for the specified forms of relief from removal from 5 years to 10 years, added a bond requirement, and eliminated the requirement of oral notice of the consequences of failing to depart within the period for voluntary departure.

2

The statute provides that the order permitting an alien to depart voluntarily “shall inform the alien of the penalties under this subsection.” Section 240B(d)(3) of the Act. There is no dispute in this case that the order of voluntary departure provided notice of the consequences of failing to voluntarily depart. Nor is there any question in this case concerning the posting of a voluntary departure bond. See Matter of Diaz-Ruacho, 24 I&N Dec. 47 (BIA 2006) (holding that an alien who fails to post the voluntary departure bond is not subject to penalties for failure to depart within the time specified for voluntary departure).

3

Some courts have ruled that a timely motion to reopen filed before the expiration of a period of voluntary departure tolls the running of the voluntary departure period until the agency rules on the motion. See, e.g., Azarte v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1278 (9th Cir. 2005) (reaching this result after considering the motion to reopen provisions of section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7) (2000), in conjunction with the voluntary departure provisions of section 240B(d)); cf. Dekoladenu v. Gonzales, 459 F.3d 500 (4th Cir. 2006) (finding that the plain language of section 240B(d) precludes tolling of the voluntary departure period upon the filing of a motion to reopen).

4

Had the respondent been represented by an attorney, we would have expected compliance with the third prong of Matter of Lozada, supra, i.e., the filing of a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities or an explanation why such a complaint was not filed.

5

Ultimately, we leave the issue of the truth of the respondent’s allegations regarding her accredited representative’s conduct to the Immigration Judge on remand.

6

At the hearing, the Immigration Judge provided the respondent with the following explanation of her right to appeal to the Board and the consequences of failing to comply with the voluntary departure order:
If an individual has a period of voluntary departure and does not leave by that date or the date given by the Appeals Board, then an alternate order of removal, in this case to Poland would go into effect. If you didn’t leave under those circumstances, then you would be barred from reopening your case for 10 years to apply for any form of relief and if you are ultimately removed or deported from the United States, you’d also be barred for 10 years without obtaining a special waiver. All of that would happen unless there were exceptional circumstances beyond your control as to why you didn’t comply with that order of voluntary departure such as being very sick or someone dying in your family or some other type of exceptional circumstance.

APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on July 18, 2006, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent has now filed a motion to reconsider. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
In his motion, the respondent has primarily reiterated the arguments that were made in his last motion. We considered these arguments before rendering our previous decision in this case and we decline to revisit them. A motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration, be supported by pertinent case precedent and be predicated on a legal or factual defect in the most recent decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991).
 
In the motion, the respondent maintains that his motion to reopen was filed with the Harlingen Immigration Court on September 7, 2005, (not as the Board referenced on March 16, 2006) but it was rescinded by the Immigration Court. While that may be true, it does not explain why the respondent waited until then to allege ineffective assistance of former counsel, when he knew of the in absentia order as early as 1998, at which time he filed a previous motion to reopen through new counsel. Consequently, we find no error in our prior decision denying the motion to reopen. See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000)(the decision to reopen proceedings is a discretionary decision, and this court applies a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard when reviewing the BIA’s denial of a motion to reopen).
 
The respondent also now alleges that his two previous attorneys who filed motions to reopen should have addressed the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel by the respondent’s first counsel, Lionel Perez. Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider, page3. To the extent the respondent now alleges ineffective assistance by the two previous attorneys, we note that the respondent has failed to even minimally fulfill any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

February 20, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mann, George P.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated August 28, 2006. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. The final order on the merits in these proceedings was entered by the Board on August 28, 2006. In that decision, we considered the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to grant him a continuance to obtain additional evidence which included statements from family members, but found that neither the respondent nor his counsel specifically requested a continuance and that the respondent was aware of the need to produce corroborating evidence. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must generally be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before November 27, 2606. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until December 14, 2006. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time.
 
The evidence submitted in support of reopening includes articles concerning country conditions in Lebanon and evidence from the respondent and his family. The respondent has not contended that the nature of any persecution he reportedly fears has changed in character, but only that it has varied in scope and degree. The evidence submitted does not establish that the respondent is entitled to an exception to the filing requirements for reopening based on an asylum claim arising from materially changed circumstances in Lebanon.
 
The respondent, who was represented throughout the appellate process and during the issuance of multiple decisions by this Board by an attorney, now attempts to raise for the first time a claim of ineffective assistance by an accredited representative at his hearing before the Immigration Judge. There is no allegation or showing that the respondent has given the accredited representative notice of this claim or otherwise complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Moreover, as the respondent has not shown due diligence in pursuing this claim of ineffective assistance, we cannot conclude that there is a basis for equitable tolling of the filing date for the motion to reopen. See also Scorteanu v. INS, 339 F.3d 407, 413 (6th Cir.2003) (An individual seeking to rely upon “equitable tolling” of a filing deadline must show that he has acted with due diligence; prejudice must be shown on ineffective assistance of counsel claim). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 6, 2006. The record reflects that the respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear, which set forth the consequences for a failure to appear. On August 19, 2004, the respondent requested a new hearing date because he was unable to get into the court building to attend his hearing. The Immigration Judge granted his request. The respondent failed to appear for his next hearing on September 17, 2004. He was ordered to be removed in proceedings conducted in absentia. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge granted reopening. However, the respondent failed to appear for his removal hearing on February 8, 2006. He was again ordered to be removed in proceedings conducted in absentia.
 
On July 13, 2006, the respondent filed another motion to reopen. He claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion was not supported by an affidavit from the respondent, or any evidence. The Immigration Judge found that statements of counsel are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980). She further found that there was no indication that the respondent had been represented by the person he claimed had ineffectively assisted him, and the motion was not supported by an application for the relief sought upon reopening. The Immigration Judge denied reopening.
 
The respondent submitted another motion to reopen on August 3, 2006. He offered evidence that a complaint had been filed against the person who claimed to be an attorney and the notary who assisted him. He also offered an affidavit, an application for cancellation of removal, and evidence to support that application. The respondent claimed that he had appeared for a hearing on August 18, 2004. He stated that he failed to appear for the hearing on February 8, 2006, because the person who claimed to be an attorney said that his case would be transferred and that he did not need to appear. He said that the current whereabouts of that person are unknown so he can not contact him, but that he has otherwise complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had been given notice of the hearing date and previously warned of the consequences for a failure to appear. She found that the respondent’s decision to ignore that warning and follow the advice of the person who assisted him did not amount to exceptional circumstances. The Immigration Judge appropriately denied the respondent’s motion. Moreover, the respondent’s motion to reopen is number barred. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). We note that the respondent’s proceedings were previously reopened to give him additional opportunities to appear, and we find no merit to his claim that he was denied due process. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven A. Mundie, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge dated November 30, 2006, in which he denied the respondent’s motion to reopen in absentia. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 723 (BIA 1999). The term “exceptional circumstances” is defined by the Act as “exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
A review of the record reflects that the Immigration Judge’s order of removal was entered in absentia on September 15, 1999. The respondent failed to file his motion to reopen within 180 days after issuance of the order of removal, as is required under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. Therefore, the motion was correctly found untimely. In his motion, the respondent stated that he failed to appear because he was fearful of being removed. We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s fear of being removed does not constitute “exceptional circumstances.”
 
In his motion before the Immigration Judge, the respondent intimates that his wife’s former counsel failed to file a timely motion to reopen. To the extent this argument is based on ineffective assistance of counsel, it is not supported as required under Matter of Lozada, 19 I& N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F. 2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Thus, the respondent’s argument fails.
 
The respondent also sought to reopen proceedings to apply for adjustment of status. An alien is not required to rescind his or her deportation order under section 242B of the Act if he or she is pursuing an application for new relief, and provided there is no evidence that the respondent received the required warnings under section 242B(e) of the Act. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998).1 Rather, the motion to reopen is only subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3). Under these standards, the respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s decision, and after September 30, 1996. He is accordingly precluded from having his motion considered under the general time limitations for a motion to reopen.
 
*2 Nor do we find any error in the Immigration Judge’s refusal to reopen sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (The Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). Becoming eligible for legal status in this country or relief from deportation after a final administrative order has been entered is common and does not, in itself, constitute an exceptional circumstance warranting consideration of an untimely motion. To hold otherwise would vitiate the statutory and regulatory deadlines, which are designed to bring finality to immigration proceedings. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992) (motions to reopen are especially disfavored in immigration proceedings because every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien). As a general rule, sua sponte authority is used sparingly and it is not used as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002). Although the respondent maintains that his lawful permanent resident wife would suffer hardship if he is removed, we do not find that the respondent has established that an exceptional circumstance exists to justify reopening these proceedings sua sponte. For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven A. Mundie, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge dated November 30, 2006, in which he denied the respondent’s motion to reopen in absentia. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 723 (BIA 1999). The term “exceptional circumstances” is defined by the Act as “exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
A review of the record reflects that the Immigration Judge’s order of removal was entered in absentia on September 15, 1999.

IN RE: EMETERIA J. RAMIREZ-MEDRANO
File: AXX XX3 537 - Imperial
February 6, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James T. Stroud, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Section 212(d)(11) waiver
 
This matter was first before the Board on March 1, 2005, following the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying her application for cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). At that time, the Board remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s eligibility for a waiver under section 212(d)(11) of the Act. See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(11) (providing for discretionary waiver of inadmissibility, based upon alien smuggling of family member, for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest). On September 14, 2005, after holding additional hearings, the Immigration Judge denied the waiver, and on October 25, 2006, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision.1 The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings alleging ineffective assistance of counsel at her hearing on her application for the section 212(d)(11) waiver. The respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen must, among other things, state the new facts to be considered at the reopened hearing and be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary materials demonstrating prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). An alien who seeks to remand or to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a heavy burden of proving that if proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. See Matter of Coelho, supra.
 
At the outset, we find that the respondent has complied with the technical requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent has also presented evidence that her former counsel, Juan Molina, failed to call available witnesses who were willing to testify about the respondent’s good moral character; attempts to further her education; church work; volunteer work; devotion to friends, family, and the community; and to the hardship her deportation would cause to her family. The respondent has submitted evidence that Attorney Molina has been disciplined and suspended by the State Bar of California on several occasions. We further observe that Attorney Molina was suspended from practice before this Board from April 11, 2006, until August 1, 2006.
 
*2 The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the circuit in which this case originates, has stated that an inquiry into whether counsel provided ineffective assistance must begin with determining whether competent counsel would have acted otherwise before examining whether an alien was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective actions of counsel. See Maravilla-Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004). In addition, “substantial prejudice” must be shown; such prejudice means that the alleged ineffectiveness affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
Based upon the record before us, we must conclude that competent counsel would have called available witnesses to testify on behalf of the respondent given that the issue presented to the Immigration Judge was whether the respondent should be granted the relief she sought as a matter of discretion. Notwithstanding this fact, however, we find that the respondent has not established substantial prejudice resulting from the failure to call the witnesses in this case. This is because we find that the outcome of the case would not have been different had the witnesses been called and had they provided the testimony described in their affidavits.
 
The respondent was seeking a section 212(d)(11) waiver of inadmissibility after it was determined she was subject to removal for assisting her adult son to enter the United States illegally. The record establishes that the person the respondent attempted to smuggle into the United States was someone the respondent knew was a convicted criminal who had been deported on multiple occasions and who had been involved in the sale of illegal drugs (Tr. #1 at 66-68, 143-44, 158-60; Tr. #2 at 8, 12). In her original proceedings before the Immigration Judge, the respondent denied any involvement in or even knowledge of the smuggling (Tr. # 1 at 131-33, 140-41). However, after the Board’s remand for consideration of her eligibility for a waiver, she finally changed her story and admitted to knowing about the smuggling of her son (Tr. #2 at 3-7). This son had been living in the house that the respondent owned in Mexico, had been renting out a portion of the house, and had various family members living in the houses around him (Tr. #1 at 59, 65, 68-69, 127, 212).
 
At the time of her hearings, the respondent still owned her house in Mexico (Tr. #1 at 127, 212; Tr. #2 at 4, 20-21). She stated that she had two children, four siblings, and her parents living in Mexico (Tr. #1 at 223; Tr. #2 at 8). Prior to being placed in proceedings, the respondent traveled monthly and sometimes more often to Mexico to visit family (Tr. #1 at 21, 62; Tr. #2 at 24). She testified that she could relocate to Mexico with little difficulty (Tr. #2 at 24-25). The respondent admitted at both of her hearings that she had failed to pay income tax in the United States (Tr. #1 at 193-96, 214; Tr. #2 at 25). She testified that she worked for pay by watching after children and dogs and by cleaning houses, and that she managed an apartment complex, for which she received housing (Tr. #1 at 195-96, 212-14).
 
*3 Even assuming the respondent had presented witnesses at her second hearing who would have testified about her good works, devotion to friends, family, and the community, attempts to educate herself, and to the hardship her deportation would cause to her family, we conclude that the outcome of this case would not have been different. In part, this is because the record already contains letters from friends and clients of the respondent stating that she and her husband are hardworking, that she provides good child care, and that she is very nice and honest (Tr. #1 at 195-97; Exh. 5). The record also contains a letter from the respondent’s church about her volunteer work (Tr. #1 at 198; Exh. 6). Thus, the evidence the respondent seeks to have considered appears to be cumulative.
 
Furthermore, the Immigration Judge exhibited specific awareness of the respondent’s equities in his decision of August 29, 2003 (addressing the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal) (I.J. #1 at 13-16). In that decision, the Immigration Judge extensively discussed various positive and negative factors in the case, including the respondent’s family ties in the United States and Mexico; the respondent’s long residence in the United States; the respondent’s numerous visits to Mexico to see family; the emotional and financial hardship her removal would cause to her husband and other family and to herself; the lost opportunities the respondent would experience; the respondent’s prospects for finding employment in Mexico based upon her experience and skills; the respondent’s lack of a criminal record; the respondent’s volunteer work with her church; the respondent’s ability to speak English; the respondent’s sense of duty to the son she smuggled and the special relationship found to exist between parents and children; the respondent’s refusal at the border to provide a sworn statement; and the fact that the respondent and her son duped the respondent’s husband into participating in the smuggling.
 
Of additional importance to our decision today are the particular circumstances surrounding the respondent’s smuggling of her son. The individual smuggled was a man whom the respondent knew had been involved in illegal drag activity and had been deported from the United States multiple times. Thus, the act of smuggling was directly contrary to the specific efforts of the United States to keep this particular individual out of the country. Moreover, there was no testimony that the smuggling was done out of any extraordinary need. The son was an adult with a place to live in Mexico and with other family members living nearby. We note that the waiver for which the respondent applied is granted for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest. It is clearly not in the public interest to grant the waiver to one who intentionally smuggles in someone known to be involved in illegal drugs and who was previously deported numerous times for that involvement.
 
*4 Also significant is the respondent’s failure to tell the truth about the smuggling until after she had been in proceedings for a number of years. Additionally, as the Immigration Judge found, the respondent’s failure to pay income tax, particularly in light of her family’s use of public services is significant. She testified that she came to the United states to find a better way of life for herself and her three children and she acknowledged that she remained here illegally and enrolled all of her children (also here illegally) in public schools, and then she further acknowledged that she had failed to pay income tax, even after being granted lawful permanent resident status through an amnesty program (Tr. #1 at 193-94, 211-14, 228; Tr. #2 at 16-20). When asked on July 20, 2005, about her taxes for the prior two years, she indicated that she did not want to pay her taxes until her “situation” was in order (Tr. #2 at 25).
 
Given the particular circumstances of the smuggling in this case; the respondent’s failure over an extended period of time to admit her actions; the respondent’s use of public services for her family but failure to pay her share of income tax, even after having been in proceedings for several years; the fact that the record already contains evidence of the positive factors in this case; and the Immigration Judge’s awareness of the respondent’s equities, we cannot conclude that the additional evidence the respondent seeks to be considered would have made a difference in the outcome of this case. The negative factors in this case greatly outweigh the respondent’s equities. Because the respondent has not presented new evidence with her motion that would likely change the result in the case, her motion to reopen will be denied. See Matter of Coelho, supra.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marsha Williams Mignott, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Morris I. Onyewuchi,
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent appeals an Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia deportation order that was entered on April 24, 1991, under former section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)) (applies when service, or attempted service, of the notice of hearing, is made prior to June 13, 1992). See Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). Although the motion was filed fifteen years after the entry of the in absentia order, there is no time limit to file a motion for purposes of rescinding an in absentia order under former section 242(b) of the Act. Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155 (BIA 1999); Matter of Mancera, 22 I&N Dec. 79 (BIA 1998). Therefore, the respondent’s equitable tolling argument based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not necessary to our consideration of the motion to rescind the in absentia order.1
 
Ineffective assistance can constitute “reasonable cause” where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), has been satisfied. See Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997). In this case, the record shows that the counsel she has accused, Mr. Suhr, did not represent her until 2001, long after the in absentia order was entered. Her failure to appear at her hearing is therefore unrelated to Mr. Suhr’s representation, and we need not further address her ineffective assistance claim.
 
The reason claimed by the respondent for her failure to appear is that she did not receive the hearing notice. She describes her personal circumstances, which led her to reside with her sister and change her address several times. Contrary to the Immigration Judge’s finding, the respondent did submit an affidavit with the motion (Exh. 12). The affidavit does not specify when she relocated with her sister from the Field Crest Drive address to the address on Gordon Way. However, we point out that, while the front side of the Order to Show Cause states the Field Crest Drive address for the respondent, the certified mail return receipt shows that it was actually addressed and mailed by certified mail to “2920 Apt F Gordon Way” in Fayetteville, where it was successfully delivered on November 28, 1990, as evidenced by her sister’s signature. This discrepancy between the address on the face of the Order to Show Cause and the address on the return receipt was apparently missed by the respondent, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Immigration Judge. Since the Gordon Way address had been successfully used in November 1990 to serve the Order to Show Cause, it is unclear why the old Field Crest Drive address, that was apparently taken from an asylum application that was filed back in 1987, was subsequently used to mail the hearing notice on February 8, 1991. We therefore do not find on this record that the respondent was provided a reasonable opportunity to appear at her April 24, 1991, hearing.
 
*2 Accordingly, we will sustain the appeal, rescind the April 24, 1991, in absentia order, reopen the proceedings, and remand the record to the Immigration Judge.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained and the April 24, 1991, in absentia order is rescinded.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

We note that even if a statutory deadline applied to motion seeking to reopen an in absentia order that was entered under former section 242(b), the Eleventh Circuit does not recognize equitable tolling of statutory deadlines. See Ali Abdi v. U.S. Attorney General, 430 F.3d 1148, 50 (11th Cir. 2005) (time periods in statute for motions to reopen immigration proceedings are jurisdictional and mandatory); Anin v.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Usman B. Ahmad, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This record was last before us on June 9, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the December 2, 2004, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status. We also noted that, although the respondent indicated that he was a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he had not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent appealed our decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On March 3, 2006, the Department of Justice made an unopposed motion to remand for reconsideration of the decision in light of evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel that was not previously considered.1 In a decision issued on April 25, 2006, the court remanded the record to the Board for consideration of this evidence and for the issuance of a new decision. Accordingly, pursuant to the court’s instructions, we hereby vacate our June 9, 2005, decision and reconsider the respondent’s appeal and motion.
 
The procedural history of this case is as follows. The Notice to Appear was filed with the Immigration Court in Newark on March 12, 2003. Numerous continuances were granted to the respondent, apparently to give him the opportunity to pursue his application for a labor certification. On July 1, 2004, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States, after the respondent failed to appear for the scheduled hearing. However, on August 12, 2004, the Immigration Judge reopened proceedings, over the objection of the Department of Homeland Security, because he was satisfied that the respondent established an “exceptional circumstance” for his failure to appear.
 
On September 23, 2004, the respondent appeared with former counsel, Tomas Espinosa, and applied only for the relief of post-conclusion voluntary departure in accordance with section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). In response to this request, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure for 60 days, with an alternate order of removal to Pakistan. The respondent did not appeal. On October 25, 2004, the respondent, through former counsel, filed a motion to reopen the proceedings, which the Immigration Judge denied in a decision dated December 2, 2004. In that decision, the Immigration Judge emphasized that the respondent “did not offer any proof to the court that he possesses an approved labor certification or an approved visa petition.” The respondent then appealed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen to the Board on January 3, 2005.
 
*2 The respondent subsequently retained new counsel, and made a motion to reopen on March 18, 2005, based on a claim ineffective assistance of counsel against his former attorney, Mr. Espinosa. As explained in his brief on appeal, dated April 29, 2005, the respondent asserted that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when Mr. Espinosa applied for voluntary departure on his behalf in September 2004. According to the respondent’s affidavit, dated April 29, 2005, Mr. Espinosa “never explained to me the consequences of requesting a voluntary departure compared to ¿theº immigration court issuing an order of deportation.” The respondent later made a motion to reopen, dated May 2, 2005, with which he included documentary evidence in support of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Upon consideration of the respondent’s submissions, we find that he has complied with Matter of Lozada, supra. However, the respondent has not demonstrated that the tactical decision made by former counsel to request voluntary departure caused him actual prejudice, for he has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for any form of relief from removal to warrant reopening of the proceedings. See Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98, 107 (3d Cir. 2005). Indeed, after the Third Circuit remanded this case to the Board, the parties were given an opportunity to file with the Board any further submissions by October 6, 2006. The respondent still has not demonstrated that he has an approved labor certification or approved visa petition; his current situation is no different from what it was when the Immigration Judge denied his motion to reopen more than 2 years ago. He cannot demonstrate eligibility for adjustment of status in accordance with section 245(a)(2) of the Act. See 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a)(2).
 
It is well-settled that motions to reopen are disfavored, and that a respondent who seeks to have the proceedings reopened must make a prima facie showing of eligibility for relief from removal. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992). See also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 107 (1988)( “There is a strong public interest in bringing litigation to a close as promptly as is consistent with the interest in giving the adversaries a fair opportunity to develop and present their respective cases”). As the respondent is already subject to an administratively final order of removal, he cannot have the proceedings reopened for an indefinite adjournment until some form of relief from removal becomes available to him. See Khan v. Atty. Gen. of U.S., 448 F.3d 226, 234-35 (3d Cir. 2006).
 
Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 2, 2004, is dismissed. The motion to reopen is denied.

At the time of the respondent’s initial motion to reopen, dated March 18, 2005, he asserted ineffective assistance of counsel, but failed to attach any evidence. On May 2, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to remand, with attached evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel. Although this evidence was submitted prior to the Board’s decision, it was not yet in the record at the time the Board issued the decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Charles C. Nett, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Scott D. Gordon
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION:
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated June 6, 2006. In our order, we adopted and affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge dated April 7, 2005, in which the Immigration Judge found that the respondent waived her right to apply for relief from removal by her failure to timely file her application for relief and supporting documentation. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the respondent’s motion. The respondent’s motion, which is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, will be denied.
 
The motion to reopen is untimely because it was originally filed on September 6, 20061 more than 90 days after our final order dated June 6, 2006. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, we decline to address the issue of equitable tolling in the respondent’s case because, even if the deadline was equitably tolled, she failed to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the respondent did not file a bar complaint against her former counsel whom she asserts provided ineffective assistance, and her explanation as to why she did not file a complaint against her former counsel is inadequate. The respondent’s motion asserts numerous, significant legal errors by her former counsel, yet she states that she did not file a complaint against her former counsel because, in part, he forgave the balance on her account, represented her pro bono for 3 years, and did not “cover up his actions.” We empathize with the respondent’s situation, but the guidelines that we set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, were designed to protect the integrity of the legal system. In that regard, the requirement that disciplinary authorities be notified of breaches of professional conduct highlights the standards which should be expected of attorneys who represent persons in immigration proceedings, the outcome of which may, and often does, have enormous significance for the person. Id. at 639-40. A respondent cannot disregard the Lozada, supra, requirements simply because she does not want to file a bar complaint against her former counsel. To allow for such an exception would render moot the requirements that we have set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 605 (BIA 1996) (describing the reasoning behind the Lozada requirement for the filing of a bar complaint); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556-60 (BIA 2003) (noting the continued viability of the Lozada requirements). Based on the foregoing, we will deny the respondent’s motion to reopen because she did not comply with the requirements that we have set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey A. Kriezelman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Thomas O’Malley
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGES:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(A), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(A)º - Excludable at entry under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) º - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of material fact
  
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated September 1, 2005, which denied the respondent’s request for waivers pursuant to section 241(a)(1)(H) and 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court.
 
In his motion, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not revisiting his deportability pursuant to section 241(a)(1)(A), and also erred in denying his requests for relief. We find a remand proper so that the respondent may be afforded the opportunity to present evidence regarding his deportability. In so finding, we will outline the procedural history of the respondent’s case to clarify the necessity of revisiting the respondent’s deportability.
 
The respondent was served an Order to Show Cause in July of 1994, and charged with section 241(a)(1)(A) of the Act, with underlying allegations that he was excludable at the time of his entry because, while he received a visa as the unmarried son of a lawful permanent resident, the DHS alleged that he was, in fact, married at the time (Exh. 1). The respondent received a merits hearing in 1995, represented by Elliot DuBois, and in a decision dated December 20, 1995, the Immigration Judge found the respondent deportable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. The respondent appealed this decision, and also filed a motion to remand based on allegedly unavailable evidence regarding his marital status, and alleged that his inability to file proper evidence regarding his marital status at the hearing was a result of ineffective assistance of counsel. This Board dismissed his appeal on April 25, 2001, although we granted the respondent’s request for voluntary departure.1 In so finding, we also addressed the respondent’s motion to remand and found that he had failed to comply with the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Thereafter, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen, on June 26, 2001, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, and submitted evidence that Mr. DuBois had been disbarred from practicing law during the period of time he represented the respondent. The DHS filed a nonopposition to this motion, indicating its belief that the respondent had attempted, in good faith, to comply with Matter of Lozada, supra. On October 31, 2001, this Board granted the respondent’s motion based on its non-opposition by the DHS, and remanded the record to the Immigration Court.
 
*2 Most recently, the Immigration Judge conducted a hearing on the respondent’s requests for relief from deportation, but did not revisit the respondent’s deportability, in part, because our April 21, 2001, decision agreed with the Immigration Judge’s findings regarding the respondent’s fraudulent misrepresentations regarding his marital status (Tr. at 38). The Immigration Judge also noted that the Board’s October 31, 2001, remand order gave no directive regarding the issues to be addressed upon remand, and because the respondent’s June 26, 2001, motion referred only to the respondent’s requests for relief, the Immigration Judge chose to tailor the hearing to address only the respondent’s waiver requests (Tr. at 37-39).
 
While we understand the Immigration Judge’s confusion regarding the issues to be addressed upon remand, we note that the basis of the respondent’s Lozada motion, granted by this Board on October 31, 2001, indicates that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel during his initial deportation hearing in 1995. Mr. DuBois represented the respondent during his initial deportation hearing and throughout his appellate process. Inasmuch as the respondent did not receive effective counsel during his 1995 deportation hearing, it is incumbent upon the Immigration Judge to provide the respondent a full and fair hearing upon remand so that he may be afforded the proper due process. See Matter of Lozada supra. Thus, on remand, the Immigration Judge should conduct a full hearing regarding the respondent’s deportability, and if found deportable, any relief therefrom.2 As such, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

On appeal and with his 1996 motion, the respondent was again represented by Elliot DuBois.

We note that, in his most recent appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in giving “diminished weight” to any equities subsequent to 1995 (2005 I.J. Dec. at 8). We agree, and recognize that the respondent’s ongoing proceedings are not frivolous.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Henry Zhang, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 19, 2005. The respondent failed to appear for her hearing on May 11, 2004. She was ordered to be removed in proceedings conducted in absentia. On May 18, 2004, a motion to reopen was filed based on a claim of no notice. The Immigration Judge denied the motion. More than a year later, on August 25, 2005, the respondent filed another motion to reopen. She claimed that her former attorney did not inform her of the hearing date, that he filed the prior motion without her consent, and that he made false statements in the motion and forged her signature on the false affidavit attached to the motion. She claims ineffective assistance of counsel. She states that she has complied with the requirements for such a claim set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
We find no merit in the respondent’s assertion in her 2005 motion that, due to a language barrier, she did not know the contents of the prior false motion until now. In her affidavit dated July 19, 2005, the respondent states that she was informed in June 2004 about the in absentia order and the prior motion filed by her former attorney, and that she was angry and took the papers to a few other lawyers who explained to her the false statements made by her former attorney in the motion and in the false affidavit. However, she waited until July 27, 2005, to file a complaint against her former attorney. The respondent has not demonstrated that she informed her former attorney of the allegations leveled against him or gave him an opportunity to respond. Although she filed a complaint with the ExeCutive Office of Imrnigration Review, she has not shown that she has filed a complaint against her former attorney with appropriate disciplinary authorities, such as the attorney’s state bar, with respect to any violation of his ethical or legal responsibilities. The respondent has not complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. She has not demonstrated that reopening is warranted. Her motion was appropriately denied. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on August 25, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 22, 2006. In that decision the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable pursuant to sections 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), (B)(i) and (A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), (B)(i) and (A)(iii), as having been convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude; for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation; and as having been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B), based on the respondent’s admissions (Tr. at 18-19) and record of convictions (Group Exh.2). Having found the respondent convicted of an aggravated felony under the Act, the Immigration Judge pretermitted his request for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8U.S.C. § 1229b(a), and ordered his removal to Mexico (I.J. at 3-4). See Ali v. Ashcroft, 395 F. 3d 722 (7th Cir. 2005). Furthermore, the Board denied a motion to remand filed by the respondent during the pendency of the appeal, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel by his former counsel, for failure to meet the requirements to establish such a claim as set out by the Board in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498 (7 th Cir. 2001) (upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada). The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen seeking to terminate his proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent requests reopening on the grounds that the convictions which form the essential basis for the grounds of removal have now been vacated.
 
*2 The respondent has offered certified copies of 5 separate orders from the Circuit Court of the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit, Kane County, Illinois, dated October 2, 2006; October 4, 2006; October 18, 2006; and November 3, 2006, granting the respondent’s motion to vacate his pleas of guilty as to his January 27, 2006, conviction in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, for the offense of Possession of Cannabis in violation of section 550/4(a) of chapter 720 of the ILCS; his November 10, 2005, conviction in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, for the offense of Possession of Cannabis in violation of section 550/4(a) of chapter 720 of the ILCS; his October 13, 2005, conviction in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, for the offense of Possession of Cannabis in violation of section 550/4(a) of chapter 720 of the ILCS; his November 14, 2003, conviction in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, for the offense of Possession of Cannabis in violation of section 550/4(a) of chapter 720 of the ILCS; and his August 5, 2005, conviction in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, for the offense of theft, in violation of section 5/16-1(a)(1) of chapter 720 of the ILCS, respectively, and vacating the respondent’s judgements of conviction entered in those cases. The record reflects that the basis for the granting of the respondent’s motions was “the failure to properly admonish the defendant” in violation of 725 ILCS 5/113-8. The only remaining conviction is a March 24, 2006, conviction in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, for the offense of Aggravated Battery/Public Place in violation of section 12-4(b)(8) of chapter 720 of the ILCS, which although a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude, was committed more than 5 years after the respondent’s admission for lawful permanent residence in the United States. Moreover, no term of imprisonment was imposed, and as such, the respondent argues that conviction will not support the grounds of removal. We observe the respondent’s motion was properly served on the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service), and the DHS has filed no opposition or other response to this motion, and the motion is deemed unopposed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3).
 
The question here is whether there still exists a conviction rendering the respondent removable from the United States, as charged; and if so, whether he can now establish his eligibility for relief from removal, or whether the proceedings should be terminated. Consequently, the motion will be granted and the record will be remanded to enable the Immigration Judge to consider the new evidence offered by the respondent relating to his removability pursuant to sections 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), (B)(i) and (A)(iii) of the Act, and to determine whether there presently remain any grounds for removal and whether he can now establish his eligibility for relief from removal, or whether the proceedings should be terminated. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen is granted. Furthermore, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and the entry of a new decision.
 
*3 FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Theodore N. Cox, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lauren T. Farber
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) º - Controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; waiver of inadmissibility; remand
  
ORDER:
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, has timely filed an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s May 31,2005, decision. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s 2001 conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance (crack cocaine and marijuana) constituted a removable offense under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), ordered him removed from the United States, and found that no relief from removal was available, albeit none was requested. On appeal and in a motion to reopen, through counsel, the respondent asserts that based on his previous counsel’s ineffective assistance he wrongfully conceded to the charge of removability and failed to apply for any applications for relief. The respondent seeks a remand to the Immigration Judge in order to apply for such relief. The respondent’s request for oral argument before this Board is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7) (2006). The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion will be denied.
 
As for counsel’s decision not to file any requests for relief and conceding the charge of removability on the respondent’s behalf, we would observe that absent a showing of egregious circumstances rising to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel, decisions of counsel are binding on the respondent. Cf. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986).1 To the extent that the respondent argues that prior counsel’s representation was constitutionally ineffective, we find that he has substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); however, he has not provided persuasive evidence of prejudice arising from counsel’s allegedly deficient performance, i.e., evidence reflecting a reasonable possibility that the outcome of his removal hearing would have been different had counsel not declined to apply for relief on his behalf or conceded the charge of removability. See, e.g., Waldron v. INS, 17 F.3d 511 (2d Cir. 1993). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is removable as charged based on his 2001 conviction under N.Y. Penal Law § 220.03 for criminal possession of a controlled substance (crack cocaine and marijuana) in the 7th degree (Exh. 2, Tab 3), as this crime is a violation “relating to” a controlled substance under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). In his brief on appeal, the respondent erroneously refers to his 2001 conviction as one for “marijuana possession” only—however, the record of conviction reflects that he was in possession of both marijuana and crack cocaine (see Exh. 2, Tab 3).
 
*2 Respondent contends that he should have been eligible for a number of waivers of inadmissibility for his various convictions in the past, including former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (repealed 1996), sections 212(h) and (i) of the Act, as well as cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). We find his arguments to be unpersuasive.
 
Relief under former section 212(c) of the Act is not available with respect to convictions arising on or after April 1, 1997. 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(h)(3). The respondent’s 2001 conviction occurred after the delimiting date of eligibility for 212(c) relief. Furthermore, relief under the provisions of section 212(h) of the Act is unavailable because that provision only applies “insofar as it relates to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana.…” Section 212(h) of the Act. The waiver can only be applied to one conviction and the respondent has more than one conviction for marijuana possession (Exhs. 2 and 3). Regarding relief under section 212(i), we find no applicability of this section to any of the respondent’s convictions.
 
Lastly, cancellation of removal is not available in this case for two reasons. First, the respondent does not meet the continuous residence requirements under section 240A(a) of the Act. In order for a lawful permanent resident alien to be eligible for cancellation of removal, he or she must have resided continuously in the United States for a period of 7 years after having been admitted in any status. Section 240A(a)(2) of the Act. The respondent first entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident in December 1974 (Exh. 2, Tab 1). His physical presence ended on July 18, 1979, the date of commission of the first qualifying offense. See section 240A(d)(1) of the Act; Matter of Perez, 22 I&N Dec. 689, 692-93 (BIA 1999) (indicating that continuous residence or physical presence for cancellation of removal purposes is deemed to end on the date that a qualifying offense has been committed). As this offense was committed less than 5 years after his December 1974 admission, the respondent is ineligible for cancellation of removal.
 
The respondent is also ineligible for cancellation of removal on the basis of his conviction for an aggravated felony. See section 240A(a)(3) of the Act. In addition to the July 1979 and November 2001 controlled substance convictions, the respondent was also convicted in August 1990 under N.Y. Penal Law § 220.03 for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the 7th degree (Exh. 3, Tab 3). Both the 1990 and 2001 convictions constitute a drug-trafficking aggravated felony under sections 101(a)(43)(B) and 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(B) and 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The term aggravated felony is defined by section 101 (a)(43)(B) of the Act to include “illicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18; United States Code).” The respondent’s offenses, which involved possession of controlled substances, do not constitute “illicit trafficking” offenses. See Matter of Davis, 20 I&N Dec. 536 (BIA 1992), modified, Matter of Yanez, 23 I&N Dec. 390 (BIA 2002). Accordingly, those offenses can qualify as aggravated felonies only under the “drug trafficking crime” clause of section 101 (a)(43)(B). In removal proceedings, the status of an offense as a drug trafficking crime is determined by reference to the decisional law of the controlling circuit court of appeals, and not by reference to any independent standard articulated by this Board. Matter of Yanez, supra.
 
*3 The Supreme Court recently, in Lopez v. Gonzales, ____ U.S. ____ (No. 05-547, decided December 5, 2006), noted that “recidivist possession” of drag offenses constitute “drug trafficking crimes” because they are punishable as felonies under the Controlled Substances Act. See Id. at footnote 6. In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this proceeding arises, has held that a state conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance qualifies as a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and, by extension, an aggravated felony, if the offense in question was committed after a prior controlled substance conviction became final. United States v. Simpson, 319 F.3d 81 (2d Cir. 2002) (citing 21 U.S.C. § 844(a)). Both of the respondent’s August 1990 and November 2001 convictions for seventh-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance occurred after the respondent’s 1979 conviction for a similar offense became final. Therefore, Second Circuit law dictates that his 1990 and 2001 convictions were for a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and an aggravated felony under section 101 (a)(43)(B). Because either of the respondent’s 1990 or 2001 offenses qualifies as an aggravated felony under Second Circuit law, the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act and statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

We note that the respondent alleges that a hearing disability, which appears to have arisen towards the end of the proceedings, contributed to his denial of due process. Even if true, we find that the respondent was not prejudiced in any way by his alleged hearing disability because the documentary evidence supports the Immigration Judge’s findings.

IN RE: VICENTE HERNANDEZ
FILE: AXX XX5 198 - SALT LAKE CITY
January 17, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
J. Christopher Keen, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Matthew R. Hall,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on September 28, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen in absentia proceedings. On October 30, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen1 alleging ineffective assistance by former counsel. The motion is denied.
 
In his affidavit submitted with the motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, the respondent averred that he was aware of the hearing date but did not appear because “I thought that the Master Hearing was going to be continued” and “I am not sure if there was a miscommunication between me and the Law Firm or if I just misunderstood what I had been told by my lawyer or by his staff-persons.” In the motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, former counsel, Mr. Lofgren, stated that although his firm had failed to remind the respondent the night before the hearing, his co-counsel “was fully under the impression that the Respondent was going to appear.” Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, page 2. Former counsel also maintained in the motion that he believed there was “some sort of miscommunication or misunderstanding between this Firm and the Respondent” that caused the respondent to believe that the hearing would be continued. Id.
 
In the current motion before the Board, the respondent now swears in the attached affidavit that former counsel told the respondent that he did not have to attend his hearing on December 20, 2005, because it would be continued. Former counsel’s statement, submitted with the current motion, indicates that his office normally calls clients to remind them of hearings, but in this case they failed to do so. In addition, former counsel states that the respondent did not appear for his hearing because counsel’s office told the respondent that his appeal of the CIS denial of his adjustment application would stop the instant removal proceedings.
 
We agree with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that the current affidavits are not consistent with what the respondent averred in the motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge. While the previous motion papers indicate possible confusion and misunderstanding, the respondent now contends that former counsel explicitly told him he did not have to attend his hearing. Moreover, we agree with DHS counsel that pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), the respondent was required to attest in detail to the agreement with former counsel as to what actions the counsel would be making on the respondent’s behalf at the hearing below. Despite the Board previously noting in our September 28, 2006, decision that the respondent had failed to fulfill this requirement, no such attestation has yet been proffered. See Tang v. Ashcroft, 354 F.3d 1192, 1196 (10th Cir. 2003)(in order to assert an ineffective assistance claim in support of a motion to reopen, alien must comply with the Board’s Lozada requirements).
 
*2 The procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, are essentially a “screening device” which the Board considers before considering the merits of ineffective assistance claims. Infanzon v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 1359, 1362 (10th Cir.2004). Here, the record does not reveal a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel. Instead, the respondent has not alleged, let alone established, that former counsel ever agreed to remind the respondent of his hearing.2 The respondent concedes, and the record reflects, that he received notice of the hearing (Exh. 2). In addition, we note that the record does not contain a Form EOIR-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance before Immigration Court, from Mr. Lofgren. Given the inconsistent accounts and lack of any details regarding the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken during proceedings below, we cannot find that the respondent failed to appear due to ineffective assistance by former counsel.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the motion is denied.

The respondent entitled the motion “Respondent’s Brief on Appeal of Denial of Motion to Reopen,” but because the respondent has already had one appeal of the IJ decision, which appeal we dismissed, this latest filing is more appropriately a motion to reopen our previous decision and will be treated as such.

2

At most, former counsel indicates that normally his office calls clients to remind them of hearings. No evidence has been proffered that indicates there was any such agreement or understanding that the respondent would be reminded of the hearing. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Exh. 5, Affidavit of Brian. K. Lofgren.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This matter was last before us on September 12, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision ordering him removed to his native Cape Verde as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. In our decision, we observed that the respondent had conceded his removability through counsel, and held that this concession qualified as a binding judicial admission. The respondent has now filed a motion, styled as a “motion to reconsider,” in which he claims that his prior attorney’s concession of removability constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
By statute and regulation, a motion to reconsider must state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in a prior Board decision, and it must be supported by pertinent authority. Section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C) (West 2005); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1) (2006). Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 56-57 (BIA 2006). The respondent’s motion does not specify any legal or factual error in our prior decision upholding the Immigration Judge’s order of removal,1 but instead challenges the validity (or the wisdom) of the concession of removability upon which that order was based. As such, the motion is in the nature of a request for reopening on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
To support a request for reopening on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien in removal proceedings must (1) provide an affidavit attesting the relevant facts, including a statement of the terms of the attorney-client agreement; (2) inform counsel of the allegations and allow counsel an opportunity to respond; (3) file or explain why a grievance has not been filed against the offending attorney. Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 2006 WL 3616557, *2 (5th Cir., December 13, 2006) (citing Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 639 (BIA 1988)). Although we are mindful of the respondent’s pro se status, his motion must be denied because it does not satisfy any of these threshold requirements. As we observed in our prior decision, moreover, there are many valid reasons why counsel may concede a charge of removability, and therefore absent compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, we are unwilling to conclude that such a concession constitutes ineffective assistance on its face.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

Although the motion reiterates the respondent’s prior appellate arguments regarding the validity of the charge of removability, the respondent does not deny that his counsel conceded removability on his behalf or that such a concession generally qualifies as a binding judicial admission.

IN RE: MARIA CEBALLOS DE ZAVALA
FILE: AXX XX6 893 - IMPERIAL
January 11, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kimberly S. Greer, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on May 5, 2005, when we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s December 10, 2003, decision ordering the respondent removed to Mexico. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen which will be denied.
 
The respondent alleges that reopening is warranted, despite the untimeliness of her motion, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (2006), because she was subject to ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal and that this, in turn, affected her ability to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See, e.g., Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003) (discussing equitable tolling for untimely motions to reopen where an alien received ineffective assistance of counsel). The respondent asserts that she has complied with the procedural requirements for asserting such a claim pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) and Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999) (stating that in order to prevail on a motion to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must establish and include the following: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not). However, the respondent also argues that strict compliance with Matter of Lozada is not required inasmuch as her former attorney’s ineffective assistance of counsel is plain on its face. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
We find that the respondent has established a claim for equitable tolling, but nevertheless decline to reopen. While the majority of the cases cited by the respondent in her brief (Respondent’s Br. at 8-9) pertain to situations where counsel has deceived an alien or committed fraud,1 which is not the claim here, the Ninth Circuit has held that equitable tolling may apply whenever a party is unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of a claim. Socop-Gonzales v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). “¿Tºhe party invoking tolling need only show that his or her ignorance of the limitations period was caused by circumstances beyond the party’s control.” Id (citations omitted). Here, the respondent alleges that she was not aware that her previous counsel failed to raise certain issues on appeal — believing they had been preserved — until the Ninth Circuit dismissed her appeal for failing to exhaust administrative remedies available to her. Assuming this failure prejudiced her, the respondent’s former counsel’s conduct could qualify as ineffective assistance of counsel. We find that it did not and decline to reopen or remand.
 
*2 First, the respondent did not comply, substantially or wholly, with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada. Although the respondent has provided a declaration about her agreement with her former counsel, both her letter to counsel informing him of the nature of her allegations of misconduct, and her complaint to the state bar, allege misconduct based on counsel’s failure to file a timely appeal. However, as the respondent’s former counsel explains in his response, we never found the appeal untimely. In other words, the respondent does not inform her previous counsel or the state authorities about the true nature of her allegations of misconduct — that former counsel failed adequately to appeal the issue of whether evidence should have been suppressed below and whether the respondent was removable as charged.
 
The respondent is correct that the Ninth Circuit does not always require strict compliance with the procedural requirements we have set forth in Lozada (Respondent’s Br. at 5). See Rodriguez-Lariz, supra; Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). However, the fact that the respondent has failed to meet the Lozada requirements precludes any presumption that the respondent was provided with ineffective assistance of counsel. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra at 526 (stating that the Lozada factors are intended to ensure that an adequate factual record exists for an ineffective assistance of counsel complaint and that the complaint is legitimate). Therefore, she has failed to meet the threshold requirements for reopening based on such a claim.
 
Furthermore, we disagree that the alleged misconduct is evident on the face of the record, as alleged by the respondent, such that compliance with the procedural requirements are not necessary (Respondent’s Br. at 5). Unlike other cases where the Ninth Circuit has found obvious cases of ineffective assistance of counsel and, therefore, no need to comply with Lozada, the respondent has failed to establish that her previous attorney’s decision about what issues to raise on appeal and how to articulate them were anything but strategy or, at the most, inadvertence. There certainly is no indication that the respondent’s former counsel lied to the respondent, engaged in fraud, filed the wrong type of petition, or failed to appear. See Rodriguez-Lariz, supra, at 1224-25. Ineffective assistance of counsel in a deportation hearing results in a denial of due process under the Fifth Amendment only when the proceeding is so fundamentally unfair that the alien is prevented from reasonably presenting her case. Id. at 1226. The respondent’s former counsel raised the issue of suppression of evidence on appeal — which relates to whether the DHS established the respondent’s removability. It is true that the respondent’s former counsel only raised one of the Immigration Judge’s reasons for finding that the evidence should not be suppressed and that, consequently, the Ninth Circuit held that the respondent failed to exhaust her administrative remedies because the alternative finding was not appealed. However, strategies which are unwise in hindsight do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rodriguez-Gonzalez v. INS, 640 F.2d 1139, 1142 (9th Cir. 1981). Furthermore, to establish prejudice, “¿tºhe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 694 (1984). As on appeal, the respondent has failed to persuade us that there was error in the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the evidence was not tainted and that it established that the respondent was removable for having smuggled in an alien.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ruchi Thaker, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated May 24, 2005. The respondents have raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and maintain that they have sufficiently complied with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). It appears, however, that in an effort to comply with Lozada’s requirement that current counsel alert prior counsel to the charges against him and allow him the opportunity to respond, counsel simply sent prior counsel a copy of the motion on the same day that the motion was filed. It would be better practice for counsel to do former counsel and the Board the courtesy of providing former counsel an opportunity to respond to the charges prior to filing a Lozada motion. Counsel should endeavor to ascertain the merits of a respondent’s claims before filing in order to avoid potentially besmirching prior counsel’s reputation wrongly and occupying the Board’s time with a frivolous motion.
 
Because prior counsel has vigorously denied the accusations leveled against him in the respondents’ motion, we find it appropriate to reopen and remand the record to the Immigration Court for the sole initial purpose of allowing the Immigration Judge and the parties to address in the first instance the question as to whether prior counsel did, in fact, provide ineffective assistance to the respondents at certain critical points in their proceedings, as claimed. If, after resolving the necessary factual and legal arguments, the Immigration Judge determines that the respondents’ claims as to ineffective assistance are without merit, the Immigration Judge should once again enter orders of removal based upon the respondents’ failure to appear for their May 13, 2004, hearing. If, however, the Immigration Judge determines that the respondents’ claims as to ineffective assistance have merit, the Immigration Judge should then entertain any applications for relief from removal. Accordingly, the motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael P. DiRaimondo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James D. Paoli
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on April 5, 2002, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision, which had denied his suspension of deportation application and granted him voluntary departure. The respondent, through new counsel, now has filed a motion to reopen, which will be denied.
 
On April 5, 2002, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision which had denied his suspension application. We agreed with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent had not established that his deportation to Poland would cause extreme hardship to himself or his United States citizen son, and we noted that the respondent’s counsel had not filed a brief as indicated. We granted the respondent 30 days in which to voluntarily depart the United States. The respondent has never departed the United States as instructed, and he remains in the United States illegally.
 
As a preliminary matter, we observe that the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. Our prior order in these proceedings was entered on April 5, 2002. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (2006), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed not later than 90 days after the date of that decision, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before July 7, 2002. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until more than 4 years later, on October 24, 2006. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argues in its response that the motion should be denied solely on this basis.
 
Although the respondent’s motion is based in part on the alleged ineffective assistance of his former counsel, who has faced state bar disciplinary action for wholly unrelated conduct, the respondent does not allege sufficient facts that would compel us to apply the principle of “equitable tolling” to the motion filing deadline. Specifically, he has alleged no misconduct on the part of former counsel that prevented him from filing his motion in a timely manner, or at least somewhat sooner than it has been filed.1
 
Therefore he has failed to exercise due diligence in his case to obtain equitable tolling under applicable Second Circuit law.2 Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000)(alien who waited 2 1/2 years to file motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel did not establish due diligence to merit equitable tolling). Moreover, we note that the respondent’s counsel has attached copies of two previous unpublished Board orders in which he filed motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of previous counsel on behalf of other aliens, and he alleges that the Board is “obligated to follow its prior decisions.” In this regard, we point out that unpublished Board orders do not represent binding precedent in the respondent’s case. Matter of Medrano, 20 I&N Dec. 216 (BIA 1990); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(g).
 
*2 We observe that previous counsel’s failure to file a brief was not the only reason we cited in our prior order as the sole basis for dismissing the appeal, as incorrectly alleged by present counsel in his motion. Our order dismissing the respondent’s appeal indicated that we had reviewed the Immigration Judge’s decision, and agreed with the Immigration Judge that the respondent had failed to establish extreme hardship to either himself or his United States citizen son to qualify for suspension. Under these circumstances, as the respondent has not established prejudice, he has not met the standards for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The respondent also has alleged that his motion deserves to be granted in the exercise of discretion because of new facts, including the maturing and educational advancement of his now 13-year-old son, and the respondent’s own marriage to a lawful permanent resident. We decline to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen the respondent’s case on this basis. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

For purposes of completeness, we note that the respondent does not allege that his previous attorney committed any fraud in his representation.

Although counsel includes an unexplained citation to Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108 (2d Cir. 1993) in a supplemental letter, we observe that the alien’s counsel in Esposito v. INS, supra, failed to file an appeal with the Board. Therefore, the issue of an attorney’s failure to file a brief on appeal was not addressed, and that case may be distinguished on the facts from the instant case.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: CORINA VITERUO-ACUNA
FILE: AXX XX4 142 - NEWARK
January 5, 2007
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Yvette W. Lewis-Williams, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent is a citizen of Peru. On July 20, 1994, she appeared before an Immigration Judge, and agreed to voluntarily depart the United States by October 24, 1994. That decision was not appealed to the Board. On May 3, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. with the Immigration Judge. Therein, the respondent requested reopening to seek adjustment of status as a victim of abuse by her United States citizen spouse.1 The Immigration Judge denied the motion as untimely on June 12, 2006, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be sustained.
 
Section 1003.23(b)(4) of 8 Code of Federal Regulations provides that “except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings (whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge) and that motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later.”
 
The record reflects that the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed with the Immigration Judge on May 3, 2006. Because the respondent’s motion was filed after September 30, 1996, it is untimely and was properly denied by the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4); Da Cruz v. INS, 4 F.3d 721 (9th Cir. 1993). We have also determined that the exceptions to these filing requirements set forth in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) are inapplicable.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that she did not understand the nature and consequences of her deportation hearing, and therefore that decision is not final. However, the period for appealing, reopening, and reconsidering the Immigration Judge’s decision has elapsed. The decision of the Immigration Judge rendered on July 20, 1994, is final. This aspect of the appeal is dismissed.
 
The respondent further argues on appeal that she is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the respondent has not satisfied the procedural requirements for presenting such a claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98 (3rd Cir. 2005). We therefore cannot reopen these proceedings on account of this reason.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that her motion should have been deemed a joint motion to reopen. She argues that the motion was unopposed because the DHS adjudication officer recommended that she seek reopening before the Immigration Judge, and never attempted to execute the deportation order. The respondent further notes that the DHS may have filed its opposition to her request for reopening untimely. Notwithstanding her contentions, we cannot find that any recommendation that the respondent may have received constitutes a non-opposition to her motion provided to the Immigration Court. In addition, even if the DHS filed an untimely opposition to her motion to reopen, we cannot find that such constitutes a joint request for reopening. We therefore affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely filed.
 
*2 The Board’s discretion to reopen sua sponte is limited to cases where exceptional situations are demonstrated. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We note that the respondent is apparently the victim of domestic abuse, as she is the beneficiary of an approved Form I-360. Moreover, the respondent married prior to the commencement of proceedings, and has been in this country for approximately 16 years. She is also the parent of a 7-year-old United States citizen child, and has been under an order of supervision with the DHS since March 2006. Having considered the totality of the circumstances, we find that an exceptional situation exists to reopen these proceedings sua sponte.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Juan J. Mendoza, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Gerrie Zhang
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)º - Convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Waiver of inadmissibility; remand
 
The respondent has appealed the November 1, 2005, and December 12, 2005,1 decisions of an Immigration Judge which found him removable, pretermitted his application for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), and ordered him removed to Mexico. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The DHS opposes the appeal and the motion. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
In a Notice to Appear dated November 4, 2004, it was alleged that: the respondent’s status was adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident on April 3, 1991, and that he was convicted in Texas on February 7, 1992, for burglary of a building with intent to commit theft, and on April 29, 1996, for tampering with a government record. The respondent was charged with removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), as an alien convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct. The respondent indicated that he wanted to pursue a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(c) of the Act.
 
At a hearing on November 1, 2005, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) asserted that the respondent was not eligible for a 212(c) waiver under section 440(d) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) due his removability for two crimes involving moral turpitude, one of which involved a plea made after the enactment of AEDPA. The Immigration Judge then entered a summary order finding the respondent removable as charged based on his concessions, and gave the DHS until December 1, 2005, to file a motion to pretermit. The respondent was given until December 8, 2005, to reply.
 
On November 2, 2005, the DHS filed a motion to pretermit based on the argument it presented at the hearing. It also submitted a Form I-261 which lodged an additional charge of removability under section 237(a)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, for a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT) committed within 5 years of entry for which a sentence of 1 year or longer may be imposed. The DHS also made the following substitute allegations of fact: that the respondent was admitted as a conditional resident on December 15, 1988, and that he was convicted of burglary on February 2, 1992, for a crime committed on January 12, 1992. The DHS added the following allegations of fact: that the conditional nature of the respondent’s status was removed on April 3, 1991, and that a year or longer could have been imposed for his burglary conviction. On December 5, 2005, the respondent filed additional documents to support his 212(c) application, but he did not respond to the motion to pretermit.
 
*2 On December 12, 2005, the Immigration Judge issued an order granting the motion to pretermit, and ordering the respondent removed to Mexico. Her reasoning was that the respondent failed to respond to the DHS’ motion, and therefore it was deemed unopposed.
 
The respondent subsequently filed this appeal. He asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in granting the DHS’ motion to pretermit solely on the lack of any response, and that she should have given him an opportunity to respond to the allegations and charge in the Form I-261. He also argues that the DHS failed to meet its burden of showing that his conviction for tampering with a government record was a CIMT. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel. He argues that his counsel at the hearing erred in failing to respond to the DHS’ motion to pretermit, and in not advising him to apply for cancellation of removal for permanent residents. He has filed supporting documents to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The DHS opposes the appeal and the motion.
 
We are remanding the record for the following reasons. The Immigration Judge’s summary finding of removability made on November 1, 2005, refers to a concession of removability. However, there is no concession of removability in the record, and no explanation as to why both of the respondent’s crimes were deemed to be CIMTs (see Tr. at 7-8; 12-13). This alone is a basis for a remand. Further, the Immigration Judge should not have entered her final order without addressing the lodged allegations and charge filed by the DHS. Further, the respondent should have been given the opportunity to respond to the allegations and additional charge. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.30, 1240.10(e).
 
Finally, we question the Immigration Judge’s decision to grant the motion to pretermit without providing any reasoning except that it was unopposed. The underlying issue involved a legal determination which should have been specifically addressed. Nonetheless, the DHS appears correct because in the case of a guilty plea made between April 24, 1996, and April 1, 1997, an application for a 212(c) waiver is subject to the limitations of AEDPA § 440(d). See 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(h)(2). Section 440(d) of AEDPA changed the last sentence of section 212(c) of the Act to provide that:
This subsection shall not apply to an alien who is deportable by reason of having committed any criminal offense covered in section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B),(C), or (D), or any offense covered by section 241(a)(2)(A)(ii) ¿two CIMTsº for which both predicate offenses are, without regard to the date of their commission, otherwise covered by section 241(a)(2)(A)(i).
 
*3 See also Matter of Fuentes-Campos, 21 I&N Dec. 905, 906 (BIA 1997). The issue is therefore whether the respondent’s individual convictions for a CIMT fall under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act (formerly section 241(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act).2 The CIMT charges therefore need to be premised on a conviction for which a sentence of 1 year or longer may be imposed. In this regard, the lodged allegations of fact become important, and the underlying statutes and conviction records must be examined to determine the nature of the respondent’s convictions. It appears that both convictions were for felonies (see Exh. 2, attachments), but this is a matter which is more appropriately resolved on remand.3 See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (precluding the Board from engaging in fact finding on appeal). Insofar as the respondent contends in his motion that he is eligible for cancellation of removal, his 1992 crime cuts off the necessary period of continuous physical presence if calculated from his entry as a conditional permanent resident in 1988. See sections 240A(a)(2) and 240(d)(1)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(2) and (d)(1)(B); Matter of Jurado, 23 I&N Dec. 29, 32 (BIA 2006). Because the record is being remanded for a new hearing, we need not address the respondent’s allegations that he had ineffective assistance of counsel at the earlier proceedings. An appropriate order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

The Immigration Judge dated the latter decision August 12, 2005. The transmittal letter attached to the decision, and other documents in the record, indicate this is the wrong date.

Section 241 of the Act applied to deportation proceedings, and was the precursor to section 237 of the Act. The regulations state that § 440(d) applies to aliens in removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(h)(2). We note that prior to the enactment of AEDPA, the single CIMT ground required that an alien be sentenced to confinement for 1 year or longer for his or her crime. This version of the ground only applies to aliens whose proceedings were initiated prior to AEDPA’s enactment date of April 24, 1996. See Matter of Fortiz, 21 I&N Dec. 1199, 1202-03 (BIA 1998).

On appeal, the respondent asserts that he is not subject to § 440(d) limitations because his second crime was committed more than five years after his admission. However, the language of § 440(d) provides that the evaluation of the two CIMTs shall be made “regardless of the date of their commission.”

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thaker, Ruchi, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated March 10, 2004. At that time, we denied the respondent’s appeal as untimely filed. More than 2 years later, on November 6, 2006, the respondent submitted a motion to accept his appeal by certification due to the ineffective assistance of his former counsel, Joseph C. Sekula. He claimed that he consulted with various lawyers over the last 2 years about what, if anything, could be done on his case. He stated that he retained a lawyer who obtained his immigration record on August 29, 2006, he then retained a different lawyer after he was detained on August 30, 2006, and finally he retained another lawyer after that. He offers a copy of a letter addressed to the Office of Attorney Ethics, dated November 3, 2006, regarding Mr. Sekula. It includes a notation that a copy will be sent to Mr. Sekula. However, there is no evidence that the complaint was filed, and no evidence that Mr. Sekula was actually informed of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond. We find that the respondent has not presented a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that is compliant with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Moreover, there is no evidence that the respondent took any action regarding the alleged ineffective assistance of Mr. Sekula until late in 2006. His lack of diligence indicates that reopening is not warranted as a matter of discretion. We find no basis to consider the respondent’s appeal on certification pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (c). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Martin Zaehringer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kathryn E. Stuever
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Remand
 
By an order dated August 23, 2006, an Immigration Judge found the respondent to have abandoned any and all claims for removal relief, and ordered her removal from the United States. The respondent filed a timely appeal of that decision, as well as a motion to remand. The respondent’s request for a waiver of the filing fee associated with the filing of an appeal is granted. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a)(1) and 1003.8(c). The motion will be granted and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that her immigration proceedings should be reopened due to the ineffective assistance of her prior attorney, Mr. Harpreet S. Brar. More specifically, the respondent avers that but for the actions of Mr. Brar, she would not only have contested her single charge of removability, but she would also have submitted an alternative motion to withdraw her application for admission within the time limit set by the Immigration Judge. The respondent further argues that Mr. Brat failed to inform her of the Immigration Court’s decision, which hampered her ability to file the instant appeal.
 
Before making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the alien must ordinarily comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). Those requirements include: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved alien setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with her former counsel, (2) that the representative whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the respondent’s motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. See id.; see also Siong v. INS, 376 F.3d 1030, 1036-37 (9th Cir. 2004). Moreover, the alien must also show prejudice from counsel’s alleged deficient performance. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793 (9th Cir. 2005); Munoz v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950, 955 (9th Cir.2003). Prejudice results when “the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Munoz v. Ashcroft, supra.
 
*2 Based upon the record before us, we find that the respondent has substantially complied with the Lozada requirements. See Respondent’s Brief, sub-exhs. 1-3. We further find that the record supports the respondent’s contention that she was prejudiced by the actions of her former counsel. For instance, Mr. Brar failed to meet any of the filing requirements set by the Immigration Judge, despite his written acknowledgment of those deadlines. See Exh. 5 (evidencing counsel’s awareness that he was to submit both the respondent’s motion to terminate proceedings and her withdrawal application for admission by July 20, 2006); see also Tr. at 10-17. See generally Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 588 n.5 (9th Cir. 2006); Lin v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir. 2004); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding ineffective assistance where counsel failed to file an application for relief for which the alien was prima facie eligible). The respondent’s prior attorney also failed to keep his client informed as to the status of her case. See generally Ray v. Gonzales, supra. Given the fact that she has been detained throughout these proceedings, we find that it was particularly incumbent upon Mr. Brar to keep in contact with the respondent. See generally Siong v. INS, supra. Thus, inasmuch as it appears that Mr. Brar’s failure to act denied the respondent an opportunity to establish her eligibility for any form of removal relief, we find that the respondent has suffered actual prejudice. Accordingly, we shall grant the respondent’s motion to reopen, and remand the record to the Immigration Court for additional proceedings.
 
In view of the foregoing, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David E. Piver, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated May 5, 2006. In our prior decision, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status. The respondent now argues that the motion should have been granted due to the ineffectiveness of his former counsel and that the record should be remanded to permit him to apply for adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) does not oppose the motion, which will be denied.
 
We note that the respondent alleges that his appeal was untimely due to ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he argues that his prior counsel failed to timely file a motion to reopen the Immigration Judge’s decision or to notify the respondent that he had failed to do so. As a result, the respondent’s voluntary departure period was not tolled and the respondent failed to leave at the end of that period, thereby rendering him ineligible for certain forms of relief for 10 years.
 
Even if we were to find that the respondent has met the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel in this case, see Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62 (BIA 2003), the respondent has not met the requirements for a motion to reopen for consideration of his adjustment of status application. In his motion, the respondent alleges that the visa petition filed on his behalf by his lawful permanent resident spouse is pending for adjudication with the DHS but has not yet been approved. Further, although the respondent’s spouse has applied for her United States citizenship, she is not yet a United States citizen and the respondent’s priority date is not yet current. Therefore, even upon approval of the respondent’s petition, there is not a visa immediately available to him. Accordingly, he is not prima facie eligible for adjustment of status. See, e.g., INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992) (an alien must make a prima facie showing both statutory eligibility for the relief sought and that relief is warranted in the exercise of discretion); Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 419 (BIA 1996) (an applicant demonstrates prima facie eligibility for relief where the evidence reveals a reasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied).
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas A. Grannan, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of an aggravated felony
Sec. 241(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of a controlled substance violation
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This matter has a long history before this Board, beginning with the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 2, 1998, decision in which he found the respondent, who on May 30, 1996, had been convicted of two counts of distribution of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (repealed 1997); and ordered the respondent deported from the United States. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal from that decision by order dated December 6, 1999.
 
On September 11, 2006, when this matter was last before us, we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our April 10, 2006, decision. In the April 10, 2006, decision, we denied his motion to reopen as time and number barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). In the instant motion, styled “Lozada Motion to Reopen,” the respondent argues that the proceedings should be reopened pursuant to INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001) to permit him to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c).1 The respondent contends that he would have earlier applied for a waiver of inadmissibility under the St. Cyr decision had it not been for the ineffective assistance of his previous counsel. In support of his motion, the respondent provided a copy of the formal complaint that he has filed with the appropriate disciplinary authority against his former counsel, a copy of a letter notifying his former counsel of the complaint and giving him the opportunity to respond to the charges, and affidavits setting out the basis of his claim against his former counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Even if the respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, he does not benefit from the St. Cyr. decision and cannot therefore demonstrate prejudice. See Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98 (3rd Cir. 2005); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra. We find that the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails and the motion will be denied on that basis.
 
*2 In INS v. St. Cyr, supra, the Supreme Court held that discretionary relief under former § 212(c) “remains available for aliens … whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who … would have been eligible for § 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.” See INS v. St. Cyr, supra, at 326. Here, the deportation proceedings were initiated against the respondent on March 27, 1997, with the filing of the Order to Show Cause (Form I-221) with the Immigration Court. The law in effect at the time of the respondent’s May 30, 1996, conviction was the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214), which was enacted on April 24, 1996. Thus, the respondent, who subsequent to April 24, 1996 was convicted of an aggravated felony, was not eligible for section 212(c) relief when his guilty plea was entered on May 30, 1996. See INS v. St. Cyr, supra; DiPeppe v. Quarantillo, 337 F.3d 326 (3rd Cir. 2003); Perez v. Elwood, 294 F.3d 552 (3d Cir. 2002); DeSousa v. Reno, 190 F.3d 175 (3d Cir. 1999). See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44 (section 212(c) available where proceedings initiated before April 24, 1996).
 
In addition, the record shows that in late July 2001 or early August 2001, the respondent was deported from the United States. See Respondent’s Affidavit in support of the instant motion. He may not reopen the original immigration proceedings to apply for a waiver of deportation because he left the United States after those proceedings were initiated. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(k)(2) (specifically providing that special motions to reopen are unavailable to aliens “issued a final order of deportation … who then illegally returned to the United States”). We note that the respondent did not state in his affidavit whether he has returned to the United States and if so, under what circumstances. In any event, the respondent’s departure deprived this Board of jurisdiction to reopen the proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

Our records show that although the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to the respondent’s motion to reconsider, the instant brief was fast filed herein as “Respondent’s Response to Government’s Opposition” on September 11, 2006, the same date that our previous decision was issued. Given the respondent’s expression of dissatisfaction with his former counsel’s performance in his brief and supporting affidavit, we noted the respondent’s failing to satisfy the procedural requirements of and demonstrate prejudice as required by Matter of Lozada.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marshal E. Hyman, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on January 28, 2005, when we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of a motion to reopen an in absentia order of removal. On July 24, 2006, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen. The respondent contends that the time limitation on a motion to reopen, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), should be tolled and that her proceeding should be reopened due to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Hamid v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 465, 469 (6th Cir. 2003). Further, the respondent has shown ineffective assistance by her former counsel. See Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). The respondent avers that her former counsel specifically directed that she not appear at her initial master calendar hearing because he was seeking consolidation of her proceeding with that of her parents. The record contains a statement from the Department of Homeland Security anticipating that the respondent’s proceeding would be heard with her family (Exh. 3). However, the respondent’s former counsel never filed a motion to consolidate, and the record does not contain any other document indicating that a request to consolidate and/or transfer venue was filed or presented. In a motion to reopen/rescind filed with the Immigration Court, the respondent’s former counsel alleged that government counsel indicated that she would route the case so that it would be consolidated, but government counsel denied that she was the trial attorney at the respondent’s family’s master calendar hearings.
 
Given these facts and circumstances, we find that the actions and advice of the respondent’s former counsel constituted ineffective assistance and that the respondent has demonstrated due diligence in presenting her claim in this regard. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is granted. Further, our decision, as well as the Immigration Judge’s decisions, are vacated, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Omar Cura, Jr., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anibal D. Martinez
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
  
APPLICATION: Section 212(c) waiver
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s July 22, 2005, order finding him removable, deeming his application for relief to be abandoned, and ordering him removed to Pakistan. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
At proceedings held on June 14, 2005, the respondent conceded removability as charged (Tr. at 15-16), and was directed by the Immigration Judge to file his application for relief in compliance with local procedures, noting that the court required strict adherence to those procedures. The Immigration Judge asked if there were any questions. Neither the respondent nor his counsel raised any questions concerning the court’s filing requirements. Nevertheless, the respondent’s application was not timely filed, and the Immigration Judge cancelled the merits hearing and entered an order of removal.
 
The respondent’s notice of appeal and brief list several explanations for the failure to timely file the application. One explanation was that there was bad advice from the clerk’s office as to when the application could be filed. This explanation was proffered in the form of a statement by counsel. Statements or assertions by counsel are not evidence. Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980). Nothing else has been submitted to support the respondent’s claim in this regard.
 
Counsel for the respondent further claims that the filing was too complex to be successfully accomplished in a timely fashion. The record does not support this claim. The transcript of record makes it clear that the Immigration Judge provided an opportunity for questions about filing and no objection was made to the scheduling of the merits hearing (Tr. at 17-18). It is clear from the record that the respondent did not object to the filing deadline.
 
The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge caused the filing to be late by arbitrarily rejecting the filed application for minor technical reasons, such as counsel’s failure to mark the box indicating he was not subject to disciplinary procedures. The assertion that any action of the Immigration Judge caused the application to be late is not supported by the record. The respondent also argues that he should not suffer from his counsel’s mistakes. However, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim has not been made. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (setting forth the procedure for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
*2 In sum, we find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the application was abandoned. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (providing that an Immigration Judge may set reasonable time limits for the filing of applications and the failure to file within the time set means the opportunity to file is deemed waived); Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549-50 (BIA 1992); Matter of Jean, 17 I&N Dec. 100, 102 (BIA 1979).

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Neil F. Lewis, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude

APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; remand
 
The respondent has appealed from an Immigration Judge decision denying her request for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). She has also requested that we remand the record due to ineffective assistance of her previous counsel, for the presentation of new and material evidence, and based on her argument that the Notice to Appear was improper. The appeal will be sustained in part and the record remanded for further proceedings.
 
The respondent has for the most part compiled with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved applicant setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the applicant in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id at 640. While it is not entirely clear from the record whether the respondent’s previous attorney acted ineffectively to such an extent as to prejudice the respondent, the respondent has now presented significant additional evidence, some of which could have been produced at the previous hearing, perhaps indicating ineffective assistance, and some of which was unavailable, requiring that the record be remanded for consideration of the new evidence. In particular, we note the possible lapse of judgement on the part of previous counsel in not calling the respondent’s United States citizen husband to testify on the respondent’s behalf although he was present at the time. It appears he will suffer meaningful hardship were the respondent to be removed from the United States, a factor only briefly considered by the Immigration Judge in his decision. We also note that although the respondent, through previous counsel, admitted to the allegations against her, the charging document does, in fact, indicate an incorrect statute under which she was convicted.
 
*2 Given the problems outlined above, we find we should remand the record for further consideration of the respondent’s removability and her application for cancellation of removal.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE O-S-G-, RESPONDENT
Decided December 6, 2006
**1 *56 A motion to reconsider a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals must include the following: (1) an allegation of material factual or legal errors in the prior decision that is supported by pertinent authority; (2) in the case of an affirmance without opinion (“AWO”), a showing that the alleged errors and legal arguments were previously raised on appeal and a statement explaining how the Board erred in affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision under the AWO regulations; and (3) if there has been a change in law, a reference to the relevant statute, regulation, or precedent and an explanation of how the outcome of the Board’s decision is materially affected by the change.
 
FOR RESPONDENT:
Brad Alexander, Esquire,
Miami, Florida
BEFORE: Board Panel: OSUNA, Acting Chairman; HOLMES and FILPPU, Board Members.
OSUNA, Acting Chairman:
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b) (2006), the respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider our decision dated June 13, 2006, in which a Board Member summarily affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge. In his motion to reconsider, the respondent restates in general terms his prior arguments and asserts for the first time that he will be persecuted on account of his membership in a particular social group. This latter claim was not raised in his Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal (Form I-589), at the hearing before the Immigration Judge, or in his brief on appeal. The respondent does not allege any factual or legal error in our prior order under the summary affirmance regulations. Nor does he refer to new legal authority that materially affects his case. The motion to reconsider will therefore be denied.
  
I. MOTIONS TO RECONSIDER
 
By statute and regulation, a motion to reconsider must state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in a prior Board decision, and it must be supported by pertinent authority. Section 240(c)(6)(C) of the *57 Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.A. § 1229a(c)(6)(C) (West 2005);1 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1).2 Only one motion to reconsider any given decision may be submitted, and it must be filed within 30 days after the mailing of the Board’s decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). In removal proceedings an alien may file only one motion to reconsider a decision that the alien is removable from the United States, and the motion must be filed within 30 days of the entry of a final administrative order of removal. Sections 240(c)(6)(A), (B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2).3 A party may not file a motion to reconsider a previously denied motion to reconsider. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). A motion to reconsider is also barred if it is filed solely to challenge a decision to affirm without opinion by a single Board Member, or to adjudicate the case without a panel of three Board Members. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(3). However, we still retain authority at any time to reconsider on our own motion any case in which we have rendered a decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). In addition, we have authority to deny a motion to reconsider as a matter of discretion. Id.
 
**2 A motion to reconsider is a “‘request that the Board reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked.”’ Matter of Ramos, 23 I&N Dec. 336, 338 (BIA 2002) (quoting Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 n.2 (BIA 1991)). A motion to reconsider challenges the Board’s original decision and alleges that it is defective in some regard. Matter of Cerna, supra, at 402. A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based on the previous factual record, as opposed to a motion *58 to reopen, which seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. Id. at 403; see also section 240(c)(7)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
A motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied. Matter of Medrano, 20 I&N Dec. 216, 219 (BIA 1990, 1991) (“Arguments for consideration on appeal should all be submitted at one time, rather than in piecemeal fashion.”) A motion to reconsider is not a mechanism by which a party may file a new brief before the Board raising additional legal arguments that are unrelated to those issues raised before the Immigration Judge and on appeal. Rather, the “additional legal arguments” that may be raised in a motion to reconsider should flow from new law or a de novo legal determination reached by the Board in its decision that may not have been addressed by the parties. Similarly, a motion to reconsider is not a process by which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief presented on appeal and seek reconsideration by generally alleging error in the prior Board decision. The moving party must specify the factual and legal issues raised on appeal that were decided in error or overlooked in our initial decision or must show how a change in law materially affects our prior decision. For example, reconsideration may be granted if a movant informs us that a particular aspect of the case, already raised or addressed during the hearing, was not considered in adjudicating the appeal, see, e.g., Matter of Ramos, supra, or if an argument raised in the brief was overlooked at the time we entered our decision, see, e.g., Matter of Robles, 24 I&N Dec. 22 (BIA 2006).
  
II. STANDARDS FOR A MOTION TO RECONSIDER A DECISION TO AFFIRM WITHOUT OPINION
 
In 2002 the Attorney General enacted regulations to streamline case management at the Board. See Board of Immigration Appeals: Procedural Reforms To Improve Case Management, 67 Fed. Reg. 54,878 (Aug. 26, 2002); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (2006). These reform regulations included the expanded use of decisions by a single Board Member. The regulations permit a single Board Member to decide a case by use of a summary affirmance order, otherwise known as an affirmance without opinion or “AWO.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4). By regulation, an AWO must state the following: “The Board affirms, without opinion, the result of the decision below. The decision below is, therefore, the final agency determination. See 8 CFR 3.1(e)(4).” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)(ii).4
 
**3 *59 The regulations regarding the use of an AWO state that a Board Member shall affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge without opinion if three conditions are met. First, the Board Member must determine that the result reached in the decision under review was correct. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4)(i). Second, the Board Member must conclude that any errors in the decision under review were harmless or nonmaterial. Id. Third, the Board Member must find that
(A) The issues on appeal are squarely controlled by existing Board or federal court precedent and do not involve the application of precedent to a novel factual situation; or
 
(B) The factual and legal issues raised on appeal are not so substantial that the case warrants the issuance of a written opinion in the case.
 
Id. (emphasis added). While the regulations bar a motion to reconsider solely on the management decision to issue an AWO by a single Board Member, a party may still move to reconsider the underlying reasons for the affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision, if appropriate. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(3).
 
In order to properly seek reconsideration of a summary affirmance order, the moving party should set forth the reasons the Board erred in concluding that the Immigration Judge’s decision was correct. The motion should identify the material errors in the underlying Immigration Judge’s decision, if any, that were overlooked by the Board and that ultimately affected the disposition of the appeal. In the event there is a change in law, the movant should identify the precedent, statute, or regulation at issue and show how the change materially affects the outcome of the case. Similarly, if the Board overlooked controlling precedent, the motion should state succinctly which issues that were raised on appeal involved such precedent, and how the case law changes the outcome of the case. In addition, the movant must show that the factual or legal issues that were raised on appeal were substantial and should have been considered, and the movant must explain how the issues, if addressed, would have changed the disposition of the appeal. A motion to reconsider an AWO that fails to address these factors, as applicable, will be denied for failure to sufficiently articulate the reasons for reconsideration.
  
III. APPLICATION
 
In the instant case the respondent is seeking reconsideration of our summary affirmance order. The motion to reconsider essentially sets forth two bases for reconsideration. First, the motion reiterates the argument first raised on appeal that the respondent has a well-founded fear of persecution *60 based on political opinion. It does so, however, in very general terms, essentially by setting forth legal propositions without a detailed discussion of how those propositions apply to the respondent. Second, the respondent requests that we reconsider the summary affirmance in light of a completely new legal claim-that he was persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his alleged membership in a particular social group. He contends that this “additional legal argument” may properly be presented in a motion to reconsider. We disagree.
 
**4 The respondent failed to assert his claim regarding membership in a particular social group in either his Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal or during the hearing before the Immigration Judge. Likewise, he did not raise this issue on appeal. Thus, the motion to reconsider fails to identify a material issue that was overlooked by the Board in affirming the decision of the Immigration Judge. Indeed, the motion to reconsider does not point to any material error in the decision of the Immigration Judge.
 
Furthermore, the motion to reconsider does not allege that the issues, as raised on appeal, involved the application of precedent to a novel situation, or that there is new precedent or a change in law that affects our prior decision. The respondent has also not asserted any new facts or provided new evidence for our consideration that would convert his motion to reconsider into a motion to reopen. Instead, the respondent generally reiterates prior arguments and raises completely new legal arguments, which were not previously raised either before the Immigration Judge or on appeal, and which are based on the same factual record. See Matter of Medrano, supra. As noted above, a motion to reconsider must include specific allegations as to how the Board erred as a matter of fact or law in its AWO decision, and it must be supported by pertinent legal authority. Because the respondent has failed to raise such allegations of error in his motion to reconsider, we will deny the motion.
  
IV. CONCLUSION
 
In conclusion, we find that a motion to reconsider should, consistent with the statute and regulations set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b), include the following: (1) an allegation of material factual or legal errors in the Board’s decision that is supported by pertinent authority; (2) if the Board summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision, a showing that the alleged errors and legal arguments were previously raised on appeal and a statement explaining how the Board erred in affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision under the AWO regulations; and (3) if there has been a change in law, a reference to the relevant statute, regulation, or precedent and an explanation of how the outcome of the Board’s decision is materially affected by the change. We find that the respondent’s motion fails to assert any factual or *61 legal errors in our prior decision under the AWO regulations. Accordingly, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

The statutory provisions regarding motions to reopen and reconsider were previously found at sections 240(c)(5) and (6) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(5) and (6) (2000). However, those sections were recently redesignated as sections 240(c)(6) and (7) of the Act by section 101(d)(1) of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Division B of Pub. L. No. 109-13, 110 Stat. 302, 304.

Although the Attorney General’s authority to entertain motions in removal proceedings is now authorized by statute, prior to 1996 the authority to consider motions derived solely by regulation. See sections 240(c)(6) and (7) of the Act; INS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450 U.S. 139, 140-41 (1981). In addition to the provisions of the statute and the regulations, a number of precedent decisions provide guidance on the filing of substantive motions. See, e.g., Matter of C-C-, 23 I&N Dec. 899 (BIA 2006) (reopening for asylum based on a change in circumstances and country conditions); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002) (reopening for adjustment of status based on a marriage entered into after the commencement of removal proceedings); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).

We observe that the statute and the regulations regarding motions to reconsider before the Board and the Immigration Judges contain slightly different language, which does not affect the disposition of this motion. Compare sections 240(c)(6)(A), (B) of the Act with 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (2006).

Although the regulations relating to the Board’s adjudication of immigration matters have been transferred from 8 C.F.R. part 3 to part 1003, the citation to 8 C.F.R. § 3.1(e)(4) in the AWO regulation has not been amended to reflect that change. See 8 C.F.R. § 3.0 (2006); Aliens and Nationality; Homeland Security; Reorganization of Regulations, 68 Fed. Reg. 9824, 9826, 9830 (Feb. 28, 2003); 67 Fed. Reg. at 54,903.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrea Guerrero, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Monica Mubaraki
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
This matter was last before the Board on May 24, 2006, when we granted the respondent’s motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In that order, we noted that the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) did not oppose the motion. The DHS has filed a timely motion to reconsider contending that it did indeed oppose the respondent’s motion, as reflected in its “Opposition to Respondent’s Motion to Reopen” (“Opposition”) dated April 24, 2006. The respondent opposes the motion to reconsider.
 
Notwithstanding the parties’ differing views on whether the DHS’ April 24, 2006, Opposition was properly filed and should now be considered, we have decided to grant the DHS’ request for reconsideration of our May 24, 2006, decision. Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is granted. Upon reconsideration, we once again grant the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
We have reviewed the material submitted in conjunction with the respondent’s motion to reopen and find that he has satisfied all of the requirements, as discussed in Matter of Lozada, supra, for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his former attorney. Further, we observe that at the time of his hearing before the Immigration Judge on February 7, 2005, (when he was represented by his former attorney), the respondent had already lived in the United States for over 15 1/2 years and had four qualifying relatives, including his lawful permanent resident mother and three United States citizen children. At a minimum, these facts warranted a discussion between the respondent and his attorney as to whether he could qualify for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The respondent maintains that his former attorney never advised him of the availability of such relief in his case. As such the line of inquiry regarding the relevant hardship facts was cut off. The failure of the respondent’s former counsel to inform the respondent even of the possibility of section 240A(b) relief in his case amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Nothing in the DHS’ Opposition persuades us to deny the respondent’s Lozada motion. The DHS asserts that the respondent’s former attorney simply concluded that the respondent could not demonstrate the necessary degree of hardship for purposes of establishing eligibility for cancellation of removal, particularly given that many of the hardship factors set forth in the respondent’s motion did not exist at the time of his hearing before the Immigration Judge. This argument fails because it is purely conjectural in nature. There is no statement from the respondent’s former attorney in the record, and therefore there is no basis for determining what he concluded about the respondent’s eligibility for cancellation of removal. Further, there has been no showing that the respondent’s former attorney ever informed him of the option of applying for cancellation of removal, much less discussed with him the specific elements for demonstrating eligibility for such relief.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The DHS’ motion to reconsider is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen filed with this Board April 7, 2006, is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s request for a stay of his removal order is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph Lopez-Wilson, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 14, 2006, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear at the hearing on June 5, 2000. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that he did not receive notice of his hearing. He claims that the Notice to Appear (Form I-862) was mailed to an address where the respondent allegedly lived, but he never received any notice of the hearing. The respondent submitted an affidavit with his motion to reopen, in which he states that one day prior to his hearing he contacted his former attorney and he was informed of his scheduled hearing date. However, he indicates that he did not have the hearing notice with him, and therefore, he was unable to find the Immigration Court in Dallas, Texas. He claims that a guard at one of the downtown buildings in Dallas told him to wait for another appointment letter. The respondent requests that the proceedings be reopened based on lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent also claims that he is eligible for asylum and he has an approved visa petition that was filed on his behalf by his brother.
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear was served personally on the respondent on November 28, 1999, and he was informed in the Spanish language of the consequences of a failure to appear. The respondent also signed the Notice to Appear acknowledging his receipt of it. On April 6, 2000, the hearing notice was sent to the respondent’s former attorney of record, Thelma O. Garcia. The Immigration Judge noted that on the day of the respondent’s master calendar hearing, June 5, 2000, the Immigration Court received a motion to withdraw as attorney of record from Ms. Garcia. The Immigration Judge indicates that he denied Ms. Garcia’s request to withdraw as the attorney of record, and he formally singed the denial order on June 6, 2000. The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia for his failure to appear on June 5, 2000.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that proper notice was provided to the respondent. The record reflects that the notice of hearing was sent to the respondent’s former attorney of record on April 6, 2000. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). Moreover, the respondent indicates that he was aware of his scheduled heating on June 5, 2000, but he was unable to locate the Dallas Immigration Court on the day of the hearing. On appeal the respondent asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, he has not complied with any of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). We find that based upon the evidence of record, the respondent received notice of the hearing in accordance with the Act, and he has not met the burden of demonstrating lack of notice under the statute. The respondent also has not established that he failed to appear due to exceptional circumstances, based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See also Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998) (claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the statutory requirement that motion to reopen be filed within 180 days of in absentia order). Nor has the respondent explained why he did not seek reopening until almost six years after being ordered removed in absentia. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: PETER KWAKA YEBOAH
FILE: AXX XX5 635 - DENVER
November 16, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Osei Prempeh, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cathy Auble
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a Citizen of Ghana, was ordered removed from the United States on February 3, 2005, because he failed to appear for his hearing. He filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on August 2, 2005, but the Immigration Judge denied the request on August 22, 2005. That decision was not appealed to the Board. The respondent filed a second motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on March 28, 2006. The motion was denied on May 3, 2006, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argued in his second motion to reopen and on appeal that these proceedings should be reopened because he is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. According to the respondent, his prior attorney neglected to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his first motion to reopen, and thereby denied him due process in these proceedings.
 
The regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) provides that an alien may file only one motion to seek reopening of an order of removal entered in absentia. The respondent’s second motion to reopen is numerically-barred from consideration. In addition, we note that the Notice of Hearing was mailed to the respondent at 1885 S. Quebec Way, #1-25, Denver, Colorado 80231, but was returned to the Immigration Court because the respondent no longer resided at the address. We further note that the respondent received the Notice to Appear at that address on November 2, 2004, and apparently changed his address thereafter, but did not notify the Immigration Court of the change. We therefore find that the respondent was properly notified of the hearing. Having found that the respondent received proper notice of the hearing, we find that the respondent has not suffered prejudice on account of his first counsel’s alleged failure to appeal the denial of the respondent’s first motion to reopen. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
Additionally, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Assaad, supra, and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988); see also Galvez Pineda v. Gonzales, 127 F.3d 833 (10th Cir. 2005) (recognizing requirements for filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim with Board). The respondent has provided no proof that his prior counsel was notified of the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel, and provided an opportunity to respond to the respondent’s second motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge’s decision is also incorporated into this order, and is affirmed.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lina T. Hernandez,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 27, 2006. The respondent failed to appear for her hearing on March 10, 2004. She was ordered to be removed in proceedings conducted in absentia. Nearly 2 years later, on January 4, 2006, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen based on a lack of notice. She claimed that she informed her former attorney of her change of address, but the Notice to Appear was sent to her prior address and she did not receive it. She stated that the illness of one relative in 2001, and the death of another in 2002, caused her to lack involvement with her immigration matters, and are exceptional circumstances. The respondent said that she was not aware that her former counsel had withdrawn her application for adjustment of status. She claimed that she is eligible for cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent did not inform the Department of Homeland Security (formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) of her change of address, and found that the Notice to Appear and the hearing notice were properly sent to her last known address. The Immigration Judge found no connection between the respondent’s failure to appear in 2004, and the illness of her relative commencing in 2001, or the death of another relative in 2002. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent had not demonstrated that she was prevented from appearing due to exceptional circumstances to warrant reopening.
 
On appeal, the respondent claims ineffective assistance from both the attorney who represented her on her motion to reopen and from her former attorney. The respondent has not presented a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that is compliant with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). She has not shown that the attorneys whose integrity or competence is being impugned have been informed of the allegations leveled against them and given an opportunity to respond. Further, the respondent has not shown that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of the counsels’ ethical or legal responsibilities, and why such a complaint or complaints have not been filed. The Immigration Judge appropriately denied reopening. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

FILE: AXX XX9 723 - DETROIT
November 7, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bruce G. Davis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kathleen L. Alcorn
Chief Counsel
*1 On May 17, 2006, an Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure in lieu of removal. The respondent has appealed. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The respondent is married to a United States citizen. The respondent alleges that she and her husband contracted with her former attorney, Mr. Casterline, to file a petition for an immediate relative visa on her behalf. The respondent further alleges that although the immigration Judge granted her several continuances so that Mr. Casterline could file the petition, he failed to do so, and, as a consequence, she was told to accept voluntary departure in lieu of removal. Faced with an order of removal, the respondent claims that she accepted voluntary departure. The order granting voluntary departure indicates that appeal was waived.
 
The respondent filed an appeal on June 16, 2006, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent also filed a motion to reopen and remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). See Hamid v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 465, 469 (6th Cir. 2003).
 
In addition, by joint motion filed August 22, 2006, current counsel for the respondent and Chief Counsel of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) request a remand for evidentiary hearing on the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. If the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel, her waiver may not have been knowing and intelligent so we would have jurisdiction to reopen and remand. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001). Further, a joint motion to reopen is not subject to the time and number limitations of a motion to reopen whether filed with the Board or the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(iii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iv).
 
In light of the joint motion, as well as the respondent’s compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, we find that the Immigration Judge should consider the respondent’s motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel before the Board resolves the appeal in this case. On remand, the parties should present their request for a subpoena to the Immigration Judge. The record will therefore be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for the reasons stated in this decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Husein A. Abdelhadi, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on May 11, 2005, when we denied the respondent’s March 30, 2005, motion to reopen. On October 4, 2006, the respondent filed the instant motion in which he asks us to reopen these proceedings on our own motion and to reissue our March 14, 2005, decision so that he can file a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. For the reasons stated below, the motion will be denied.
 
First, we consider the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied as time and number barred. See sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) (an alien may file one motion to reopen and, with certain exceptions not relevant here, it shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal). The final administrative decision in this case was issued on March 14, 2005. This is the respondent’s second motion to reopen.
 
The respondent asks us to reopen these proceedings on our own motion based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997)(holding that the Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). The respondent alleges that his prior attorney, Mr. Anthony Osei, never informed him that he could file a petition for review of our March 14, 2005, order in federal court. The respondent also alleges that because Mr. Osei failed to timely file a writ of habeas corpus in federal court after the issuance of our May 11, 2005, decision, he lost his opportunity to seek judicial review of our order. The respondent complied with the procedural requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
On October 18, 2006, we received Mr. Osei’s response to the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Mr. Osei adamantly denies the respondent’s allegations of misconduct. First, Mr. Osei explains that the respondent was properly informed of his options after this Board dismissed his appeal. According to the fee receipts, the respondent paid $600 in legal fees for a motion to reopen and he paid the $110 filing fees. Compare Mr. Osei’s Affidavit and Attachments F and G with Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 7-8, and Attachments A and B. Second, Mr. Osei emphatically denies that he ever directed, prepared or filed a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of the respondent. He also asserts that he was never paid to prepare such a filing. Compare Mr. Osei’s Affidavit at 4 with Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 8 and Attachments A, B and E. Based on the foregoing, we find that the respondent has failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that would support sua sponte reopening.
 
*2 The respondent has also asked us to reissue our March 14, 2005, decision so he can seek review in federal court. The respondent has failed to show that a reissued decision is warranted in this case. Notably, the respondent does not allege that Mr. Osei failed to notify him of our decision, or that Board did not properly mail the decision to Mr. Osei, or that Mr. Osei did not receive the Board’s decision. Rather, the respondent argues that given his counsel’s ineffective assistance, this is the only way to properly remedy the case. See Respondent’s Motion at 13. As noted above, on the basis of the record before us, we cannot find that Mr. Osei’s assistance was ineffective. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reissue will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Laura A. Michalec
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
  
APPLICATION: Termination
 
The respondent moves to reopen our October 27, 2005, decision summarily, dismissing his appeal. The Department of Homeland Security, (DHS) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed not later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on January 25, 2006, since the final administrative decision was issued on October 27, 2005. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time. The respondent contends that his criminal conviction was not final; however, the DHS points out that the documentation provided by the respondent does not establish that his conviction is on direct appeal. The DHS observes that the respondent has instead filed a motion for post-conviction relief. The mere availability of post-conviction motions or other forms of collateral attack does not affect the finality of the conviction. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154, 157 (BIA 1996). See generally Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894, 896 (BIA 1994) (concluding that a conviction is final when the right to direct appeal is exhausted); see also Marino v. INS, 537 F.2d 686, 691-92 (2nd Cir. 1976) (explaining that an alien is not deemed to have been “convicted” of a crime under the Immigration and Nationality Act until the conviction has attained a substantial degree of finality, and such finality does not occur unless and until direct appellate review of the conviction, as contrasted with collateral attack, has been exhausted or waived). We cannot entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction, unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to determine the guilt or innocence of an alien. Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1034 (BIA 1999).
 
The respondent also alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, but has not established that the deadline for submitting a motion to reopen should be equitably tolled. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir.2006) (citing Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 128 (2d Cir.2000)). The court stated in Cekic, “Tolling is available if the alien can demonstrate that (1) his counsel’s conduct violated ¿hisº constitutional right to due process, and (2) the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period ¿ heº seeks to toll.” Id. To make this showing, an alien must demonstrate that he pursued his case “¿fºrom the point at which the ineffective assistance of counsel should have been, or was in fact, discovered.” See id. at 171 (citing Iavorski, 232 F.3d at 135). It is the respondent’s burden to establish that the 90-day deadline should be equitably tolled, but he has not established due diligence. Moreover, the respondent has manifestly failed to comply with any of the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (B1A), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), wherein we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46-47 (2d Cir.2005). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.

IN RE: MARIO ERNESTO HUEZO-LANDAVERDE
FILE: AXX XX8 060 - LOS ANGELES
October 31, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patricia Duggan, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States because he failed to appear for his hearing scheduled for April 26, 2000. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on June 5, 2006, but the Immigration Judge denied it on July 28, 2006. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent does not dispute on appeal that he received the Notice to Appear. He indicates in his affidavit that he moved to Seattle in 1999, mailed a change of address form to the Immigration Court, and was even told by his aunt that a Notice of Hearing was not received on his behalf. He argues that he complied with his obligation to notify the Immigration Court of his address change, and these proceedings should be reopened.
 
We have reviewed the record, and note, as did the Immigration Judge, that a change of address form is not contained therein. We further note that the respondent did not submit a statement from his aunt to corroborate that the respondent lived with her at 1235 S. Sharon Court, #K3, Anaheim, CA 92804, and the respondent’s Notice of Hearing was not received by her at that address. We therefore do not find that the respondent rebutted the presumption that the Notice of Hearing was properly delivered at his last known address. Salta v. INS, 314 F.3d 1076 (9th Cir. 2002). We further cannot find that the respondent proved that he mailed a change of address form to the Immigration Court immediately after moving to Seattle. We note that the respondent does not indicate in his affidavit the address that he allegedly moved to, and when he moved. We therefore cannot find based on the general representation reflected in the affidavit that the respondent timely notified the Immigration Court of his address change.
 
The respondent further argues on appeal that he was ineffectively represented by his former counsel in these proceedings. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639, we held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the claim reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. In addition, in Reyes v. Ashcroft,, 348 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2003), the court noted that the alien failed to give the prior counsel notice of his motion to reopen. Id. at 1131-1132. The court emphasized that the purpose of Lozada’s notice requirement is to afford the prior counsel an opportunity to contest the allegations of ineffective assistance so that the adjudicator can more accurately assess the claim of ineffective assistance. Id. at 1132.
 
*2 In the instant case, the respondent has failed to submit a complaint against his former attorney with the proper authority, and did not notify him of the allegation of negligence. No explanation for the failure to do so was provided. We further do not find that a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel is present. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9 th Cir. 2000). We cannot find that prior counsel was in any way responsible for the respondent’s failure to appear for the hearing, or materially impeded his right to pursue this appeal. We find that it is appropriate to require compliance with the above requirements. The respondent has not done so, and his request for remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel is denied.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dominick S. Cardinale, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Craig A. Harlow,
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 In an order entered on August 2, 2006, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal by affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent, through different counsel, has filed a motion to reopen, based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen shall not be granted unless it appears that the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(c)(1).
 
The respondent argues that his former counsel “failed to properly articulate” the basis for eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility, that he failed to “make any effort to review or reopen the facts” of his criminal case, and that he failed “to properly review and discuss alternative applications for relief.”
 
Litigants are generally bound by the conduct of their attorneys absent egregious circumstances. LeBlanc v. INS, 715 F.2d 685 (1st Cir. 1983): Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Ineffective assistance of counsel is a denial of due process only if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his or her case. Mejia Rodriguez v. INS, 178 F.3d 1139 (11th Cir. 1999); Ramirez-Durazo v. INS, 794 F.2d 491 (9 th Cir. 1986).
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be supported by: 1) an affidavit by the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; 2) a showing that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and 3) a showing that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, or if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498 (7th Cir. 2001). The respondent has failed to show that he has complied with the last of these requirements, and so his motion must be denied.
 
Moreover, given the respondent’s circumstances, he is ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to the former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), it is difficult to conceive of an argument that former counsel could have made before the Immigration Judge that would have somehow rendered him eligible for that relief. Neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board is imbued with the authority to “review or reopen the facts” of the respondent’s criminal proceedings, in terms of addressing guilt or innocence, or attacking the conviction. Former counsel’s participation in the respondent’s criminal proceedings is a matter beyond the scope of our jurisdiction.
 
*2 We are aware of no relief from removal for which the respondent would be eligible, so it is unclear how former counsel could have rendered ineffective assistance by not discussing alternative relief. The respondent obviously harbored no fear of harm in Bangladesh, having traveled to that country in 2002 to get married, and again in 2004 for the birth of his child. Given the respondent’s frequent travels to Bangladesh, and the lack of any mention at the hearings about any fear of harm, the Immigration Judge was under no obligation to discuss withholding of removal or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture.
 
We note that current counsel has represented the respondent at least since April 2006, and counsel submitted an extensive appellate brief on the respondent’s behalf, regarding eligibility for section 212(c) relief. However, no mention was made by either current counsel or the respondent prior to our order of any alleged ineffective assistance. It is unclear why current counsel and the respondent would have waited until after the Board rendered its order to present allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. In any event, those allegations are unavailing.
 
We find no indication of prejudice to the respondent’s case by the quality of representation rendered by his former counsel.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tracy C. Udenwagu, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rory H. Potter
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This matter was last before the Board on July 20, 2001, when we issued an order affirming the Immigration Judge’s April 5, 1999, decision finding the respondent removable as charged, determining that good cause for a continuance of his proceedings was not demonstrated inasmuch as there was no showing that the immediate relative spousal visa petition a filed in his behalf had been approved, and ordering him removed to his native Nigeria. On March 2, 2006, the respondent filed a motion with this Board seeking to reopen his proceedings so that he may be pursue adjustment of status given that his United States citizen wife has filed a new visa petition in his behalf. He also asserts that he was not effectively represented by counsel in his prior proceedings.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely by 4 1/2 years and therefore is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (2006) (providing that, with certain exceptions not presented here, a motion to reopen must be filed with the Board within 90 days after the mailing of the Board decision). The Board retains limited discretionary powers under the regulations to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte in unique situations where it would serve the interests of justice. However, we have considered the arguments set forth in the respondent’s motion in light of the record before us and have concluded that such reopening is not justified here. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) (2006); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
The respondent is not currently eligible for adjustment of status. There has been no showing that the visa petition filed February 24, 2006, by his current United States citizen wife, Anthonia Ngozi Monogo, has been approved. This is the second petition filed by Ms. Monogo in the respondent’s behalf. The first petition filed by her on September 30, 1997, was denied by the district director on May 12, 2003,1 pursuant to section 204(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act given a prior determination by the district director that the respondent’s marriage to his first United States, citizen wife, Reba Adefope, was a sham. See district director decision, May 15, 1996 (denying the visa petition filed by Reba Adefope); Board order, June 6, 1997 (dismissing the petitioner’s appeal of this decision). Both of the district director’s decisions are now final.
 
Further, notwithstanding the respondent’s assertions to the contrary, the circumstances presented here do not fall within the purview of our holding in Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). The instant motion to reopen is untimely and therefore is not properly filed. In addition, the DHS opposes the motion on substantive grounds, and not only because the underlying visa petition has not yet been adjudicated.
 
*2 The respondent also asserts that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in his prior proceedings. This claim has not been adequately developed or explained by the respondent. See Respondent’s Motion, p. 2. In any event, he has failed to comply with any of the requirements discussed in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for advancing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See generally Lara v. Troiminski, 216 F.3d 487, 498 (5th Cir. 2000).
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sharlene S. Richards, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Gerrie Zhang
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on June 14, 2005, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s April 14, 2004, decision finding the respondent inadmissible as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4).
 
On June 15, 2006, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen these proceedings to afford him the opportunity to apply for voluntary departure under section section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the respondent’s motion because it is untimely filed and the respondent is ineligible for voluntary departure under section 240B(a) if the Act because he is an arriving alien.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied as untimely filed. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (with certain exceptions not relevant here, a motion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal).
 
The respondent argues that the motions deadline should be equitably tolled based on his claim of ineffective assistance by his former counsel, Ms. Martha E. Garza. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has not published an opinion explicitly adopting the doctrine of equitable tolling in the context of a motion to reopen immigration proceedings. However, even if we assume that such tolling is available to the respondent, he has not established that he is entitled to it based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Although the respondent has substantially complied with the procedural steps set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), he has failed to prove any prejudice resulting from his former counsel’s performance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
First, the respondent asserts that because Ms. Garza failed to file a timely appeal brief with this Board that he will never know whether he “had a meritorious appeal.” See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Exhibit 12 (Respondent’s Affidavit at 3). This Board could have, but did not, summarily dismiss the respondent’s appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E) (an appeal may be summarily dismissed where a party indicates on Form EOIR-26 that he will file a brief or statement in support of the appeal and, thereafter, does not file such a brief or statement, or reasonably explain his failure to do so, within the time set for filing). Instead, we summarily affirmed with decision of the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4). The respondent has failed to show that the filing of an appeal brief would have altered the decision in his case.
 
*2 Second, the respondent asserts that he was prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s failure to inform him of his right to apply for pre-hearing voluntary departure. Arriving aliens, like the respondent, are barred from applying for voluntary departure in lieu of being placed in proceedings or prior to the completion of such proceedings under section 240B(a)(1) of the Act. See section 240B(a)(4) of the Act.
 
Third, the respondent asserts that there could have been a change in the law which might have affected his appeal. The respondent’s assertion is speculative and, in fact, never came to pass. In sum, the respondent has failed to establish how his case was prejudiced as a result of Ms. Garza’s alleged misconduct.
 
Finally, inasmuch as the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge abused her discretion when she failed to grant him another continuance to afford him the opportunity to identify a form of relief for which he was eligible, he has yet to identify a form of relief from removal for which he is eligible. Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gregory Osakwe, Esquire
*1 On April 28, 1998, this Board summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen in August 2006, claiming that he was a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion will be denied.
 
The appeal was summarily dismissed because of the failure to file a separate brief or statement. The appeal form itself contained allegations relating to the respondent’s criminal proceedings and failed to raise an appellate issue that we could address. The respondent claims in his motion that his counsel in his criminal proceedings provided ineffective assistance, as did his counsel in his deportation proceedings. Allegedly, the respondent’s former counsel in his deportation proceedings, who reportedly cannot be located, was suspended from practicing law in Connecticut in April 2006, and he filed a complaint against her on August 21, 2006.
 
The nature and quality of the respondent’s representation in his criminal proceedings involves a matter beyond our jurisdiction to address.
 
The respondent does not explain why he waited over 8 years to file a motion to reopen or, for that matter, to file a complaint against his former counsel with her state bar disciplinary board. The failure to file a brief may amount to deprivation of due process. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). However, we find no basis here for an exception to the time limitations on motions to reopen, in view of the respondent’s failure to exercise due diligence on his own behalf.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Victor D. Nieblas Pradis, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on April 29, 2003. In that decision, we upheld an Immigration Judge’s March 13, 2002, decision, in which she declined to reconsider her prior decision denying suspension of deportation. We denied a motion to reopen on February 26, 2004, as untimely. We denied another motion to reopen as late, and number-barred, on May 1, 2006. The pending motion was filed late, on May 26, 2006, and is barred by numerical limitations for motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be granted.
 
The respondent’s previously filed motions sought to have proceedings reopened in order to pursue an application for adjustment of status, based on marriage to a United States citizen. See section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1245; Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). An I-130 immediate relative visa petition was approved on the respondent’s behalf on August 8, 2003.
 
The respondent, in his previous motions to reopen, blamed attorney Timothy McCandless, who has been suspended from practice before the Board, for providing ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent now argues that attorney Walter Burrier, who has also been suspended from practice before the Board, committed ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent argues that Burrier sent a substitute attorney to the immigration court to represent the respondent concerning his suspension claim. The respondent states that, after the Immigration Judge denied his motion to reconsider, and this Board affirmed that denial, Burrier agreed to file a petition for review with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The respondent contends that Burrier then assigned McCandless to file the petition for review, without notifying the respondent, but McCandless failed to file the petition for review. Burrier then filed the first motion to reopen with the Board, which was denied as untimely. The respondent states that Burrier assured him that he would take care of everything. The respondent states that Burrier then prepared the second motion to reopen, which was presented as a pro se motion during the time that Burrier was suspended from practice before the Board. The motion was denied as untimely on May 1, 2006. After the second motion was denied, the respondent consulted current counsel and the pending motion was filed shortly thereafter.
 
*2 The respondent argues that Burrier failed to assist him in timely presenting evidence concerning his application for suspension of deportation, and prepared ineffective motions to reopen (Respondent’s Mot., at p. 15). The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Under the circumstances, we agree that the motions deadline should be excused.
 
Accordingly, the record is remanded in order to afford the respondent an opportunity to present his application for adjustment of status to the Immigration Judge, and to provide further evidence concerning his application for suspension of deportation.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph C. Sekula, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U-S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on December 22, 2004, at which time we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 29, 2003. The respondent now seeks the reopening of his immigration proceedings based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the respondent’s motion. The motion will be denied.
 
In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), this Board discussed the evidence that must be presented in order for an alien to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel arising in immigration proceedings. See also Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98, 106 (3d Cir. 2005); Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 131-35 (3d Cir. 2001); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62 (BIA 2003). See generally Filja v. Gonzales, 447 F.3d 241, 256 (3d Cir. 2006); Luntungan v. Att’y Gen. of the United States, 449 F.3d 551 (3d Cir. 2006). In that opinion, we held that not only must an alien satisfy certain procedural requirements, but he must also demonstrate that his attorney’s actions caused him actual prejudice — for instance, the alien must show that but for the errors complained of there was a reasonable probability that he would not have been ordered removed. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640; see also Ponce-Leiva v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 369, 377-78 (3d Cir. 2003). In the present matter, the respondent has not complied with all of the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada. See Motion to Reopen, sub-exhs. E-F. Specifically, the respondent has failed to submit an affidavit setting forth in detail his attorney-client agreement. Without evidence of the respondent’s agreement with his former attorney, we cannot conclude that there was ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Furthermore, even were we to assume that his prior counsel had been defective, the instant motion must still be denied because the respondent has not shown that he suffered any prejudice as a result of his attorney’s conduct. For instance, in his motion, the respondent principally argues that his case should be reopened in order to provide him with an opportunity to request the “humanitarian reinstatement” of the visa petition that his mother, who is deceased, previously submitted on his behalf.1 See Exh. 2A at 2 (stating that his mother passed away on May 16, 1995); cf. section 205 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1155; 8 C.F.R. § 1205.1(a)(3)(i)(C) (requiring the revocation of a family-sponsored petition upon the death of the petitioner “unless the Attorney General in his or her discretion determines that for humanitarian reasons revocation would be inappropriate”); see also sections 2(a)(1) and 2(b), Family Sponsor Immigration Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-150, 116 Stat. 74 (codified as amended at section 213A(f)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1183a(f)(5)). See generally INS Memorandum for Regional Directors - Policy Change - Public Law 107-150, the Family Sponsor Immigration Act of 2002: Use of Substitute Sponsor if Visa Petitioner Has Died (HQADJ 70/21.1.1) (June 15, 2002) (hereinafter “INS Memorandum”), available at http:// www.uscis.gov/graphics/lawsregs/handbook/PL107_150Pub.pdf. However, the reinstatement of the respondent’s visa petition would not by itself provide the respondent with any relief from removal. See section 213A(f)(B) of the Act; see also section 212(a)(4)(C)(ii) of the Act. To the contrary, he would still need to establish his eligibility for either an immigrant visa or section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255. See INS Memorandum at 2. For reasons that will be discussed below, we find that the respondent has failed to show that he is prima facie eligible for either form of relief.
 
*2 To establish his eligibility to either adjust his status or obtain an immigrant visa abroad, the respondent must demonstrate that he is admissible to the United States for permanent residence. See, e.g., section 245(a) of the Act. See generally Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98 (3d Cir. 2005). In the present matter, the respondent’s NTA charged him with two grounds of inadmissibility, both of which were sustained by the Immigration Judge.2 See Exh. 1. Although the respondent argues that his prior counsel prejudiced his case by failing to demonstrate that he is inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that he is removable as charged.3 See Interlocutory IJ Dec. (Sept. 15, 2003). See generally Motion to Reopen at 3. The validity of the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent is removable as charged is particularly important here because before the respondent could obtain either a new immigrant visa or adjust his status, he must demonstrate his ability to waive any and all applicable grounds of inadmissibility. See generally section 212 of the Act. Unfortunately, the respondent has not submitted any waiver applications. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) (“A motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.”); see also Filja v. Gonzales, supra, at 255 (discussing the “three principal grounds” on which the Board may deny a motion to reopen immigration proceedings). Moreover, he has failed to make out a prima facie case for any such applications, all of which are discretionary.4 Accordingly, we find that the respondent has not shown that he suffered any prejudice as a result of his prior attorney’s conduct.
 
In view of the foregoing, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is denied.

Footnotes

With regard to the sufficiency of the respondent’s Notice to Appear (“NTA”), we note that the Act and the regulations do not require that an immigration official’s signature or title be included on a Notice to Appear. See section 239(a)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(c). See generally 8 C.F.R. §§ 239(a), 1239.1(a). Furthermore, the regulations state that the omission of any of the enumerated items “shall not provide the alien with any substantive or procedural rights.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(c). Therefore, we do not find that the respondent’s Notice to Appear (NTA) is defective for failing to comply with section 239 of the Act or the regulations.

The respondent does not contest the Immigration Judge’s finding that he is inadmissible pursuant to section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Act.

3

During the earlier proceedings, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent was removable pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act as a result of his willful misrepresentation of the fact that his mother had passed away before the issuance of his immigrant visa. See Interlocutory IJ Dec. (Sept. 15, 2003). See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1205.1(a)(3)(i)(C). The respondent has never testified or submitted any evidence indicating that he did not know that his immigrant visa application at least insinuated that his mother was still alive at the time he obtained his visa. See Exh. 2E (indicating, in 1998, that the respondent’s father was deceased; but providing a current United States address for his mother); cf. Exh. 2A at 2. See generally Exhs. 2B, 2F and 2G. Inasmuch as his failure to provide this information cut off a line of inquiry on an issue that was material to his ability to procure an immigrant visa, we agree that he has failed to demonstrate that he is not removable under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act.

4

The respondent has failed to even establish that he is prima facie eligible for the humanitarian reinstatement of the visa petition that his mother filed on his behalf. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2; see also Filja v. Gonzales, supra, at 255. While the Family Sponsor Immigration Act of 2002 would provide him with a practical means of seeking reinstatement, to do so he would still need to submit an affidavit of support (Form I-864) from a “substitute” sponsor. Insofar as the statute permits only certain family members to qualify as such and the respondent has not shown that he has a relative who is both willing to act as his substitute sponsor and could qualify as one, he has not submitted sufficient evidence from which we could infer that he has even a plausible claim for relief. Moreover, in light of the manner in which the respondent previously obtained an immigrant visa, we likewise conclude that he has not shown that he would merit this, or any, discretionary grant form of relief.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mark R. Whitworth,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 05, 2006. The respondent’s attorney appeared at the respondent’s hearing on October 27, 1986, but the respondent failed to appear. The respondent was ordered to be deported in proceedings conducted in absentia. More than 17 years later, the respondent filed two motions to reopen, claiming that she had no notice of the hearing and that she is eligible for relief from deportation. The Immigration Judge found that the notice was properly served on the respondent’s counsel who had appeared at the hearing, and who attested that he sent notice to the respondent but she did not maintain contact with him. He denied both motions. On October 20, 2005, the respondent filed a third motion to reopen. She claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge found that he could not determine what agreement the respondent had with her former counsel, and that there was no evidence that she had informed him of her averments: He concluded that she had not complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), affd, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and that her motion was untimely. On appeal, the respondent correctly points out that her motion included her statement of the agreement she had with her former counsel, notice to him of her allegations, and his response. See Motion to Reopen dated October 14, 2005, Exhibits G and H-1. We agree that she has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. However, the evidence indicates that the respondent’s former counsel sent the hearing notice to the respondent at the address she provided, and filed the change of venue motion that she requested. See Exhibit H-1, supra. He appeared at the hearing and explained that the respondent failed to maintain contact with him. In fact, the respondent failed to contact her former counsel or inquire into the status of her deportation proceedings for more than 17 years. The evidence does not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent’s lack of diligence indicates that favorable discretion is not warranted. The motion was appropriately denied. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carrye Washington, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on March 29, 2002, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s applications for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), and adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255. On June 29, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen in which he claims that he received ineffective assistance from his former criminal attorney, Karen Stevens, and the appellate attorney in his criminal case, Daniel Koryn, as well as from his former immigration attorney, Steve Hershberger, whom he claims did not raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against the two criminal/appellate attorneys and who did not raise sufficiently aggressive arguments regarding the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of a section 212(h) waiver. Through his motion, the respondent seeks to again apply for a section 212(h) waiver of inadmissibility and adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed no response to the motion. The respondent’s motion for a stay of removal was denied on July 20, 2006. The motion to reopen is denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). In addition, the respondent’s motion does not comply with any of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Statements of counsel regarding whether bar complaints were filed or former counsels notified of the allegations are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). As the respondent has not complied with the Lozada requirements, his motion to reopen is denied. See Lara v. Trominiski, 216 F.3d 487, 498 (5th Cir. 2000) (holding that the general application of the Lozada requirements does not constitute an abuse of discretion by the Board). See also Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, ___ F.3d ___, 2006 WL 2390283 at 1, n. 4 (5th Cir. Aug. 21, 2006) (stating that alien had failed to comply with Lozada requirements and the application of those requirements was not an abuse of discretion).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

FILE: AXX XX0 794 - LOS ANGELES
September 22, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard Camarena, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated May 8, 2006, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The respondent filed a timely appeal from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that notice to the respondent’s counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See Section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255. The record reflects that the Notice of Hearing was sent to the respondent’s counsel by regular mail (Exh. 3) and included the date and time of his hearing in October 2005. The respondent did not appear, at the hearing and the Immigration Judge correctly ordered him removed in absentia.
 
Written notice is considered sufficient if provided at the most recent address provided under section 239(a)(1)(F)of the Act. Contrary to the respondent’s argument on appeal, the record reflects that the Notice of Hearing was mailed to the respondent’s counsel at his correct address, as reflected in the Form EOIR-28. There is no indication that the hearing notice was returned to the Immigration Court.
 
Furthermore, this case is distinguishable from Salta v. INS, 314 F.3d 1076 (9th Cir. 2002), wherein the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that, under the circumstances, a sworn affidavit from the alien that neither she nor a responsible party residing at her address received the notice was sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery and entitle an alien to an evidentiary hearing to consider the veracity of her allegations. In that case, the alien had actually initiated a proceeding to obtain a benefit and an affidavit was submitted with the motion, Id. at 1079.
 
In the instant matter, there is no indication that the respondent initiated removal proceedings. Moreover, the respondent did not submit an affidavit to overcome the presumption of proper delivery.
 
Lastly, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails because the respondent has not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aft’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In that case, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned is informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where this case arises, has found the application of the noted requirements to generally be reasonable, but has held that “they need not be rigidly enforced where their purpose is fully served by other means.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). Here, however, the respondent has failed to even minimally fulfill any of the above-noted requirements. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeff Lindblad
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N ACt ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Section 212(c) waiver
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 24, 2006, decision denying him a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (repealed 1996).1 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The issues on appeal include whether a fair hearing was conducted before the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for a section 212(c) waiver. The respondent contends on appeal that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion and violated the respondent’s due process, both by admitting into evidence proffered by the respondent’s spouse without requiring her to testify, and by going outside the record of conviction in denying his application. He also argues that, as the counsel who represented him both before the Immigration Judge, failed to have the Immigration Judge suppress the evidence of the restraining order, he received ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent argues that, by going outside the record of conviction in denying his waiver application, there was a denial of due process. However, the Immigration Judge, upon review of the record as a whole, balances the adverse factors evidencing an alien’s undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented in his behalf to determine whether the granting of section 212(c) relief appears in the best interests of this country. See Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581, 585 (BIA 1978). The respondent has questioned the admissibility of a restraining order, arguing that the order was entered in absentia, as well as the admissibility of a letter from his spouse (Gp. Exh. 9). While the respondent challenges the validity of the order, he has conceded that he was aware of the court date, but failed to appear (Tr. at 114). An Immigration Judge may receive into evidence any oral or written statement which is material and relevant to any issue in the case made by the alien or any other person during any investigation or examination. Such evidence may be admitted as long as it is probative and its use is fundamentally fair so as not to violate due process standards. Matter of Escobar, 18 I&N Dec. 412 (BIA 1983); Matter of Exilus, 18 I&N Dec. 276 (BIA 1982). As for the statement from his spouse, his counsel objected to its use as there was no opportunity to cross-examine her (Tr. at 102-3). The Immigration Judge acknowledged that problem (Tr. at 104), and we note that the Immigration Judge considered the restraining order but gave no weight to his spouse’s statement, making no reference to the contents of the letter in his decision. To the extent that the respondent argues that prior counsel’s representation was ineffective, he has not substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and has not provided persuasive evidence of prejudice arising from counsel’s allegedly deficient performance, i.e, evidence reflecting a reasonable possibility that the outcome of his removal hearing would have been different had counsel objected to clearly admissible evidence, the restraining order. See Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999) (finding that prejudice must be shown for a due process challenge and that prejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome). Accordingly, there has been no showing that the respondent’s hearing was not fairly conducted.
 
*2 As for the adequacy of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent argues that the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) failed to prove that he is undeserving of a waiver. However, regulations provide that the respondent, not the DHS, shall have the burden of establishing that he is eligible for any requested benefit or privilege and that it should be granted in the exercise of discretion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). The Immigration Judge properly weighed all of the adverse and favorable factors in denying the respondent a section 212(c) waiver. Matter of Marin, supra. The Immigration Judge considered all of those favorable factors, individually and cumulatively, but nonetheless concluded, based upon the adverse factors of record, including the crimes the respondent had committed, that this outweighed the favorable factors. No arguments have been presented on appeal by the respondent which persuade us that the Immigration Judge’s decision should be disturbed. In sum, we find that the respondent’s application for a section 212(c) waiver was properly denied by the Immigration Judge.
 
The respondent finally argues in his appeal that the proceedings were an unconstitutional violation of equal protection and due process. It is well-settled that this Board has no jurisdiction to adjudicate facial constitutional challenges to the Act or its implementing regulations. Matter of C-20 I&N Dec. 529, 532 (BIA 1992).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: JOSE LEONEL BAEZ FERNANDEZ

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ruchi Thaker, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This matter was last before the Board on March 24, 2006, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s November 22, 2004, order finding the respondent removable as charged and denying his applications for relief from removal, in particular his application for relief under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, (the “Act”) 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). On June 22, 2006, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen the proceedings, asserting that his former counsel provided him ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to call attention to the case Restrepo v. McElroy, 369 F.3d 627 (2d Cir. 2004). The motion will be denied.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-640 (BIA 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counser’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The respondent’s motion satisfies each of these elements.
 
However, Lozada, also requires the claimant to establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 561-562 (BIA 2003). The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998). For the reasons stated below, we find that the representation was not negligent and the respondent has not shown prejudice in this case.
 
The sole basis for the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is that former counsel, the Immigration Judge, and this Board failed to consider Restrepo. According to the respondent, Restrepo stands for the proposition that an alien who relied on the availability of § 212(c) relief in going to trial, rather than pleading guilty, remains eligible for a § 212(c) waiver after the repeal of the statute. We disagree. Under governing Second Circuit precedent, the repeal of § 212(c) is not impermissibly retroactive as applied to aliens like the respondent who were convicted of a criminal charge at trial before the elimination of § 212(c), because they “cannot show that they altered their conduct in reliance on the availability of such relief.” Rankine v. Reno, 319 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir. 2003) (emphasis added); cf. INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 326 (holding that “§ 212(c) relief remains available for aliens … whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for § 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect”). In Thorn v. Ashcroft, 369 F.3d 158, 161-63 (2d Cir. 2004), the Second Circuit reaffirmed Rankine, and distinguished Restrepo, as a case in which the alien claimed an alternative basis for relying on the availability of § 212(c). Specifically, the petitioner in Restrepo claimed that he decided to forgo the opportunity to apply for § 212(c) relief “affirmatively” under 8 C.F.R. § 212.3 (b), before being placed in deportation proceedings. Restrepo, at 622, 636.
 
*2 Unlike the petitioner in Restrepo, the respondent has not raised an alternative basis for relying on the availability of § 212(c) relief. In particular, he has made no assertion that he delayed filing an affirmative application for § 212(c) relief in reliance upon the continued existence of § 212(c).1 Therefore, we find that the respondent’s case falls squarely within the holding of Rankine, as an alien convicted of a criminal charge at trial and that he suffered no prejudice through his former counsel’s failure to cite Restrepo.2 In light of our finding that Restrepo is not controlling, we need not address the respondent’s remaining arguments, each of which stem from that case. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.

We further note that a petitioner claiming reliance based on the Restrepo set of circumstances—where an alien claims detrimental reliance on the continued existence § 212(c) in delaying the filing of an affirmative application for § 212(c) relief—must make an individualized showing of reliance on the continued existence of § 212(c) relief. Thompson v. Ridge, 2005 WL 433277 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (noting that the Second Circuit in Restrepo left open the question of whether individual reliance must be shown or a “categorical” approach should be applied to all such aliens). The respondent has made no such showing in this case.

Additionally, we note that former counsel argued on appeal that the respondent was eligible for § 212(c) relief under Ponnapula v. Ashcroft, 373 F.3d 480 (3d Cir. 2004), a case in which the petitioner was permitted to file a § 212(c) application even though he did not accept a plea agreement and was convicted after trial. Although a Third Circuit decision is not binding in this case, we find that the citation of Ponnapula was sufficient to call attention to the respondent’s potential eligibility for § 212(c) relief under the St. Cyr, supra, line of cases.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vargas, Patricia, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 11, 2006. The respondent’s case was last before us on January 4, 2002, when we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge to provide the respondent with an opportunity to seek a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act pursuant to INS v. St. Cyr, 121 S. Ct. 2271 (2001). The record reflects that the respondent was present with counsel on October 13, 2005, when the Immigration Judge provided notice concerning the next hearing to be held on January 19, 2006. On January 19, 2006, the respondent failed to appear. On March 28, 2006, he submitted a motion to reopen, and claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. He stated that he failed to appear due to the specific instruction from his counsel that he did not need to appear for that hearing because it would be continued. The respondent has explained his decision not to file a bar complaint. The issue on appeal is whether the respondent has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent’s counsel had appeared at the hearing and verified that the respondent had notice of the hearing. She concluded that the respondent had not demonstrated substantial compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
According to the respondent’s affidavit, two different individuals from the law firm that continues to represent him told him he did not need to appear for the hearing on January 19, 2006. Both individuals named by the respondent, Mr. Duran and Mr. Ramos, have submitted entry of appearance forms indicating they were admitted to the bar in the state of California. Under these circumstances, and considering that Ms. Vargas confirmed on the day of the last hearing that the respondent had proper notice, we do not find this to be a situation where full compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, is unnecessary. It is not clear from the record who is to blame for the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing for which he admittedly received proper notice from the Immigration Judge. If a properly licensed attorney told the respondent he need not appear under these circumstances, then compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, is necessary to assign responsibility for this ineffective assistance. The respondent’s suggestion that he received “erroneous instructions” which “do not merit a complaint to the State Bar” is unpersuasive because it is not merely the respondent’s prerogative as to whether or not to comply with Matter of Lozada, supra. Given the different attorneys who were apparently involved in the respondent’s representation, this is simply not a case where “the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002). See also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). The Immigration Judge appropriately denied reopening. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Culas, Roberto G., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Matthew Hall,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 07, 2006. The record reflects that the respondent appeared before an Immigration Judge on November 8, 2005, and was allowed the opportunity to depart the United States voluntarily by March 8, 2006. On February 24, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. Therein, the respondent indicates that his mother filed a visa petition on his behalf, and he is prima facie eligible to adjust his status to a lawful permanent resident of the United States. He further indicates in his affidavit that his former counsel may not have notified the Immigration Judge at the hearing of the respondent’s eligibility for relief from removal. He requested a new hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on March 7, 2006, and this appeal followed.
 
The respondent argues in his Notice of Appeal that his former counsel was negligent in these proceedings because counsel failed to advise the Immigration Judge at the hearing that he was eligible for adjustment of status. However, the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely filed because it was submitted more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s November 8, 2005, order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4). The respondent has also failed to indicate when he learned of his counsel’s alleged negligence. We therefore cannot find based on the evidence submitted that equitable tolling of the period for seeking reopening is appropriate.
 
In addition, the respondent fails to meet the requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Galvez Pineda v. Gonzales, 127 F.3d 833, 838-39 (10th Cir. 2005) (recognizing the requirements for filing ineffective assistance of counsel claims). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The respondent has not complied with any of the procedural requirements for proving that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. It is therefore inappropriate to reopen these proceedings to allow the respondent a new hearing. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Amy W. Apostol, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Stephen M. Ruhle
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated April 26, 2006, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the order of deportation that had been entered on May 14, 1984, in deportation proceedings which had been conducted in absentia under section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b), due to the respondent’s failure to appear. The respondent filed a timely appeal from that decision. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that he had no knowledge that he had ever been placed under deportation proceedings. Moreover, he disclaims any knowledge of the attorney who represented him in those proceedings, and in any event, maintains that he did not receive notice of the deportation hearing scheduled for May 14, 1984, and that said attorney failed to notify him of that hearing and his actions constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, and establish reasonable cause for his failure to appear.
 
The respondent’s allegations are belied by the record. At the outset, we consider the respondent received personal service of the Order to Show Cause (form I-221S) on June 10, 1983, while he was detained at the El Paso Processing Center. The respondent’s fingerprint and signature were placed on the Order to Show Cause at the time it was served (Exh. 1). Furthermore, the record indicates the respondent retained the attorney Paul Douglass to represent him as evidenced by the Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney (Form G-28) filed on the respondent’s behalf and dated June 14, 1983 (Exh. 2). The respondent’s counsel, Paul Douglass, then filed a motion for bond redetermination dated June 14, 1983 (Exh. 3), and the respondent’s bond was reduced to $500 after a bond hearing held on June 14, 1983 (Exh. 4). On June 15, 1983, the respondent posted bond and was released from custody, and the respondent’s counsel, Paul Douglass, was the obligor for this bond (Exh. 5). Upon his release from custody, the respondent was served with a notice that his hearing had been rescheduled to an undetermined future date (Exh. 6). On June 30, 1983, the Immigration Court sent notice of the respondent’s rescheduled hearing for May 14, 1984, to his attorney Paul Douglass, by certified mail, return receipt requested (Exh. 7). This notice was accepted and signed for by the office of his attorney Paul Douglass on July 1, 1983 (Exh. 8). The record reflects the respondent failed to appear for the rescheduled hearing. See I.J. Dec. at 2. Since the respondent failed to appear for the hearing on May 14, 1984, he was ordered deported in absentia to Mexico (Exh. 9).
 
*2 We find that the Immigration Judge correctly concluded that the Immigration Court provided proper notice of the hearing to the respondent. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). Moreover, we find no support for the respondent’s contention that his attorney of record failed to inform him that he had a scheduled hearing which resulted in the order of deportation being entered in his absence.
 
We have held that to satisfy a claim based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must support his claim by a detailed affidavit, inform his previous attorney of the allegations of misconduct and provide the attorney with an opportunity to respond, and state whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to the attorney’s alleged violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Here, the respondent has failed to comply with any of the prongs described in Matter of Lozada, supra. Accordingly, we find that the respondent has not satisfied a Lozada showing of ineffective assistance of counsel. See also Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997) (burden of proving ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
Consequently, we find that the respondent received proper notice of his hearing and that he has not provided any reasonable cause of his failure to appear. See Matter of Ruiz, 20 I&N Dec. 91 (BIA 1989); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988); Matter of Nafi, 19 I&N Dec. 430 (BIA 1987). The respondent has presented no arguments on appeal that would cause us to reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)º-Crime involving moral turpitude
Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This matter was last before the Board on June 2, 2005, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s May 7, 2004, decision finding the respondent removable as charged, statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal, and denying his application for voluntary departure. The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, on August 22, 2006, filed a motion to reopen. He acknowledges that the motion was not filed in a timely fashion but urges that the proceedings should be reopened by reason of his submission of evidence showing prima facie eligibility for relief as well as evidence which is material. He also requests reopening by reason of ineffective assistance of counsel, both during the proceedings before the Immigration Judge, and on appeal. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed not later than 90 days after the date that decision was rendered, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). In the instant case, the Board issued a decision on June 2, 2005. A motion to reopen would therefore have been due on or before Thursday, September 1, 2005. As the respondent acknowledges, the motion was untimely where it was filed on August 22, 2006, approximately 12 months after it was due. The respondent claims that the filing deadline should be ignored as he is eligible for relief and has submitted material evidence. However, those are the requirements which must be satisfied for the Board to grant a timely filed motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
In our precedent decision in Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), we emphasized the importance of the time limits on motions to reopen, noting the need to discourage dilatory motions and Congress’ mandate that we do so. We further recognized our limited discretionary power to reopen, as well as the need to exercise such power only in exceptional situations. Id., see also Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000). The burden is on the respondent to demonstrate that an exceptional situation exists. The respondent in this case has failed to meet that burden. The respondent identifies June 2, 2005, the date of the Board decision, as the last date of his claimed ineffective assistance of counsel. In that decision, we found that he had failed to meet the procedural requirements as set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), and that he had failed to show prejudice. In his motion he fails to address why his untimely motion to reopen should be considered, given that nothing in his motion presents a circumstance which precluded him from timely filing his motion to reopen. The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed out of time, and we find that exercising our discretion to reopen this matter is not in order.
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent intended his “Motion to Reopen and Reconsider” to be considered a motion to reconsider, we point out that it is untimely. A motion to reconsider must be filed within 30 days after the mailing of the Board decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The Board’s decision in this case was entered on June 2, 2005. Thus, a motion to reconsider would have been due on or before July 5, 2005. Accordingly, to the extent that we consider the respondent’s motion as a motion to reconsider, it must be considered to have been filed out of time.
 
Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s June 1, 2006, decision ordering him removed from the United States as an alien who has knowingly assisted another alien to enter the United States in violation of law. See section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) (2000). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The sole issue raised on appeal is whether the attorney who represented the respondent during his proceedings before the Immigration Judge provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to file an asylum application on the respondent’s behalf and by failing to investigate whether the respondent was in fact removable as charged. We dismiss the respondent’s appeal for several reasons. As a threshold matter, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), nor does the record show such a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance” as to warrant consideration of his claim despite his failure to comply with those requirements. Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 587-88 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000)). In this connection, we note that the respondent— while sworn—repeatedly admitted to the Immigration Judge that he had knowingly assisted another alien to enter the United States in violation of law, thereby supporting the charge of removability (Tr. at 15-16, 39-40). Moreover, although he initially stated that he had a fear of persecution or torture in El Salvador (Tr. at 17), he specifically disavowed that assertion—again, while sworn—in two subsequent hearings. (Tr. at 42, 45). Absent truly compelling circumstances not present here, an attorney does not provide ineffective assistance by declining to pursue lines of inquiry or forms of relief that have been expressly foreclosed by the sworn testimony of the client.
 
Finally, the respondent has not provided persuasive evidence of prejudice arising from counsel’s allegedly deficient performance, i.e, evidence reflecting a reasonable possibility that the outcome of his removal hearing would have been different had counsel provided more proficient representation. Ray v. Gonzales, supra, at 587; Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 824-26 (9th Cir. 2003). Specifically, the respondent has offered no evidence, either before the Immigration Judge or in connection with his appeal to this Board, to suggest that the charge of removability is unfounded or that he is in fact eligible for asylum despite his representations that he has no fear of persecution or torture in El Salvador. Although the respondent’s appellate brief contains a statement of counsel indicating that he conceded removability in order to protect his estranged spouse, who he claims was the real “culprit” in his alien smuggling activity, such statements by counsel are not evidence. Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980).
 
*2 Because the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is deficient on its face, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rev. Michael R. Sciumbato, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mindy E. Hoeppner
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 5, 2006, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. Subsequent to filing a notice of appeal, the respondent filed a motion to rescind and reopen with the Immigration Court on June 28, 2006. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States, following the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing on January 31, 2006. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that he established exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear due to the disconnection of his cellular telephone, which resulted in the inability of the respondent’s former counsel to contact him regarding the new hearing date; and due to the ineffective assistance of former counsel. Specifically, the respondent contends that his former counsel failed to inform him in writing of his next scheduled hearing, despite the fact that his former counsel was aware of the respondent’s current address. The respondent has submitted additional evidence on appeal in support of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to establish exceptional circumstances based on his claim that his cellular telephone was disconnected, and therefore, his former attorney was unable to contact him on his cellular telephone to inform him of the new hearing date. The respondent failed to provide any evidence regarding the dates of the alleged disconnection or the reason for the disconnection. Moreover, the respondent’s claim of exceptional circumstances due to disconnection of a cellular telephone does not qualify as an “exceptional circumstance” as defined section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
 
On appeal the respondent is represented by new counsel and now alleges ineffective assistance of counsel as the basis for his failure to appear. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) are satisfied. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent has submitted additional evidence on appeal, including his affidavit, a letter to his former attorney informing him of the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, and a complaint letter to the Utah State Bar Disciplinary Committee. The Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). However, we find such evidence probative of the respondent’s claim of exceptional circumstances due to ineffective assistance of counsel and will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for consideration of this issue only. Accordingly, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

FILE: AXX XX4 575 - PORTLAND
September 8, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Aaron Clingerman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Thomas L. Day
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)º - Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on June 10, 2005, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s March 11, 2004, decision denying the respondent’s application for adjustment of status. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4).
 
On March 29, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen these proceedings to afford him the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status. He also asks for a stay of voluntary departure.
 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the respondent’s motion. It asserts that the respondent’s motion is not supported by material, previously unavailable evidence that supports reopening. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (a motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing). The DHS also asserts that the respondent’s underlying approved immediate relative visa petition was automatically revoked when the petitioner, the respondent’s United States citizen spouse, died. See 8 C.F.R. § 205.1 (a)(3)(i)(C). Consequently, it asserts that the respondent is no longer statutorily eligible for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i).
 
Initially, we observe that the respondent’s March 29, 2006, motion to reopen is time barred under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings, whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge, and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened). A final administrative order was entered in this case on June 10, 2005.
 
The respondent argues that the motions deadline should be equitably tolled based on his claim of ineffective assistance by his former counsel, Mr. James White. The respondent asserts that Mr. White failed to inform him of the status of his appeal and of his right to file a motion to reopen. The respondent has provided a declaration in which he claims that he first learned that this Board dismissed his appeal on February 10, 2006, during an interview with DHS officers. See Respondent’s Motion at 2. The respondent also correctly asserts that Mr. White was suspended from the practice of law in Oregon effective December 10, 2005, and was suspended from practice before this Board and the Immigration Courts effective January 11, 2006. See Decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals dated January 11, 2006. The respondent states that complete compliance with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), is unnecessary where, as here, the ineffectiveness is clear from the record.
 
*2 Equitable tolling of the time limits for motions to reopen is available to aliens who have filed with the Board otherwise untimely motions in which they raise allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). We find that equitable tolling is appropriate in this case where the respondent substantially complied with the Lozada requirements, established that his case was prejudiced as a result of Mr. White’s misconduct, and, diligently filed this motion to reopen within a month of learning that his appeal was dismissed.
 
We now turn to the merits of the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent seeks reopening to apply for adjustment of status. The DHS asserts that the respondent is no longer eligible for adjustment because his underlying visa petition was automatically revoked on the death of his United States citizen spouse.
 
However, pursuant to section 201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b)(2)(A)(i), if the alien was the spouse of a United States citizen for two years before the citizen’s death and was not legally separated from the citizen at the time of the citizen’s death, the alien shall be considered to remain an immediate relative after the date of the citizen’s death but only if the spouse files a petition under 204(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(ii), with in two years after such date and only until the date the spouse remarries. Although it is unclear when the respondent’s wife died, it appears that the respondent may be eligible for file a visa petition under this provision.
 
The respondent was granted a period of voluntary departure by this Board pursuant to section 240B(b) of the Act. Such period of voluntary departure ended on August 9, 2005. The respondent failed to depart the United States during such time period. In most cases, an alien who fails to depart the United States within the time period specified in a voluntary departure order is, by virtue of that failure, rendered ineligible for adjustment of status for a period of 10 years. See section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d). In this case, however, respondent’s failure to voluntarily depart or file a timely motion within the voluntary departure period was due to the clear ineffectiveness assistance of counsel. Accordingly, we find that the respondent is not barred from relief by operation of section 240B(d) of the Act. See generally Azarte v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1278 (9th Cir. 2005) (holding “that in cases in which a motion to reopen is filed within the voluntary departure period and a stay of removal or voluntary departure is requested, the voluntary departure period is tolled during the period the ¿Boardº is considering the motion”).
 
*3 Based on the foregoing we find it appropriate to grant the respondent’s motion to reopen and remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge so that the respondent can apply for adjustment of status and any other form of relief from removal for which he can establish eligibility. The appropriate orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Duane Montano, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Bonnie K. Brady,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen the proceeding to apply for adjustment of status based on his status as the spouse of a deceased United States citizen as provided in section 201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b)(2).1 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
An Immigration Judge has limited authority to hear an application for adjustment of status in removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(1). Relevant to the instant matter, the regulations provide that although there is no direct appeal from the decision of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to deny an adjustment application, the “applicant, if not an arriving alien, retains the right to renew his or her application” in removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(5).
 
The record reflects that by notice (Form I- 191) dated December 5, 2002, the district direct of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (now the DHS) denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status.2 He is not now, however, seeking to renew that application; rather, the respondent has ignored the renewal procedure authorized in the regulations and is seeking reopening to apply for adjustment of status based on an entirely different visa petition. See Matter of Lasike, 17 I&N Dec. 445 (BIA 1980) (holding that an application may be considered “renewed” only when based on the same facts and reviewed according to circumstances as they existed when the original application was filed). We find no legal authority in the Act or in the regulations, and the respondent has not provided any legal authority, that permits him to seek adjustment of status based on a self-petition where, as here, the alien is in removal proceedings and a previously filed adjustment application has been denied by the DHS.
 
In any event, the respondent failed to support his motion to reopen with a completed application for adjustment of status (Form I-485) with supporting evidentiary material. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The respondent has not shown that his self-petition has been approved or that he is the beneficiary of an approved visa petition filed by his now deceased United States citizen wife. See section 245 of the Act; Matter of Perez Vargas, 23 I&N Dec. 829 (BIA 2005) (The DHS has sole authority to adjudicate a visa petition.). Further, he has not provided any evidentiary material to show the likelihood that he will succeed in demonstrating the statutory requirements for a self-petition under section 201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Act. Consequently, the respondent has failed to provide prima facie proof of eligibility for adjustment of status under the Act. See Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992); Matter of Sipus, 14 I&N Dec. 229 (BIA 1972).
 
*2 The respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge violated his right to due process by failing to inform him of the relief available to him during the removal hearing is foreclosed by United States v. Aguirre-Tello, 353 F.3d 1199 (10th Cir. 2004). In that decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the circuit in which this cases arises, decided that a deportable alien does not have a constitutional right to be informed of discretionary relief that might be available to him or her. See id., at 1204. To the extent that the respondent is asserting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his former counsel for “inexcusable neglect,” the claim fails because the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

The respondent filed a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Court on May 4, 2005. Before the Immigration Judge ruled on that motion, he filed the instant appeal on May 5, 2005. Jurisdiction in this matter is now with this Board.

According to the Form I-191, the respondent failed to provide information concerning his convictions on February 28, 2001, and on March 18, 2002, for domestic abuse of his now deceased United States citizen wife. The record contains a copy of the February 12, 2004, judgment of the Municipal Court, City of Englewood, Arapaphoe Country, Colorado, in which the court vacated the February 28, 2001, conviction.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Claudia Valenzuela, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael Harper
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony pursuant to section 101(a)(43)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B)º

Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
 
  
APPLICATION: Dismissal of Aggravated Felony Charge
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s May 22, 2006, decision that ordered him removed from the United States as an alien convicted of aggravated felonies, controlled substance Violations, and two or more crimes involving moral turpitude. See sections 101(a)(43)(B), 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 (a)(43)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). During the pendency of the appeal the respondent submitted a motion to remand. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion will be denied.
 
The respondent requests that his claim be remanded in order for the Immigration Judge to consider legal arguments regarding his eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a). He contends that his previous counsel failed to raise established legal precedent, and further compounded his error by conceding that the respondent had been convicted of an aggravated felony, prejudicing the respondent’s claim in its entirety. He argues that the professional incompetence of the counsel representing him in Immigration Court deprived the respondent of due process. The respondent’s current counsel indicated in an affidavit that a complaint had been filed with the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission against the respondent’s former counsel, and that a copy of the complaint had been supplied to the respondent’s former counsel.
 
Where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is made, the Board has found that certain criteria must be met. Specifically, the claim must be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make, counsel must be informed of the allegations against him and provided an opportunity to respond, and the respondent must indicate whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498 (7th Cir. 2001) (upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada).
 
*2 While the respondent has indicated that he is attempting to comply with the established requirements to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this matter arises, has held that, in addition to meeting the procedural requirements, an alien must also show prejudice. The Seventh Circuit held in Kay v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 664 (7th Cir. 2004) that an alien seeking to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must show that the alleged errors likely affected the outcome of the proceeding. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 558 (BIA 2003) (finding that the respondent had failed to show the requisite prejudiceto warrant consideration of his late appeal on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.) While the respondent argues that there was ineffective assistance of counsel because his previous counsel conceded that the respondent had been convicted of an aggravated felony, the respondent does not suggest that, had previous counsel not done so, the outcome would have been affected, particularly in light of the Immigration Judge’s analysis, and current legal precedent. Moreover, the respondent has not indicated what arguments he would have presented before the Immigration Judge that would have changed the outcome of the proceedings. Accordingly, as the respondent was not shown, by the previous counsel’s conduct, to have experienced actual prejudice during the course of the proceeding before the Immigration Judge, there can be no ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is without merit, and the motion to remand will be denied.
 
Turning to the underlying issues on appeal, the respondent is a lawful permanent resident of the United States. The record reflects that on or about November 14, 2003, he entered a plea of guilty in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, to a charge of possession of cannabis in violation of section 550/4(a) of chapter 720 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes (ILCS), for which he was sentenced to 12 months court supervision. Furthermore, on October 13, 2005, he was convicted in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, to a charge of possession of cannabis in violation of section 550/4(a) of chapter 720 of the ILCS; on November 10, 2005, he was convicted in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, to a charge of possession of cannabis in violation of section 550/4(a) of chapter 720 of the ILCS, and on January 27, 2006, he was convicted in the Circuit Court for the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit of Kane County, Illinois, to a charge of possession of cannabis in violation of section 550/4(a) of chapter 720 of the ILCS (Gp. Exh. 2). Based on these convictions, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent was removable as an alien who has been convicted of aggravated felonies under section 101 (a)(43)(B) of the Act, rendering him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(3).
 
*3 After reviewing the respondent’s appellate arguments, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision. The Seventh Circuit has held that an alien’s state drug conviction, which is a felony under state law, but which only qualifies as a misdemeanor under federal law, is not an aggravated felony under section 101 (a)(43)(B) of the Act. See Gonzales-Gomez v. Achim, 441 F.3d 532 (7th Cir. 2006). However, the Seventh Circuit subsequenttly held, in Tunis v. Gonzales, 447 F.3d 547 (7th Cir. 2006), that a drug offense, state or federal, that would be punishable as a felony under federal law, is an aggravated felony for purposes of immigration law.
 
Under this precedent, the respondent’s 2005 and 2006 convictions plainly qualify as aggravated felonies because, with his 2003 conviction final, his subsequent convictions for possession of a controlled substance violate the Federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. § 802 et seq., and are punishable as felonies under the CSA. See 21 U.S.C. § 844. In short, the Immigration Judge’s legal conclusion in the respondent’s case is correct under applicable legal standards. The respondent is removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony, making him ineligible for cancellation of removal.1
 
Accordingly, the following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

We are not aware of a Seventh Circuit ruling involving two simple possession convictions. But the respondent’s second possession offense was punishable as a felony had it been prosecuted, following federal procedural requirements, in federal court. While we do not know how a federal prosecutor would have prosecuted this offense, the respondent did commit a felony violation of the CSA. See Gonzales-Gomez v. Achim, supra, at 534-35.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
CARLOS A. CRUZ
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 31, 2006. The record reflects that the respondent was given, in court, the notice of the next hearing date and the consequences for a failure to appear. He failed to appear for his hearing on November 20, 1990. He was ordered to be deported in proceedings conducted in absentia.
 
More than 14 years later, he submitted a motion to reopen to apply for benefits under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA). He claimed that his notary advised him that he would be deported if he went to the hearing. He stated that his fear of deportation, limited education, and the false information from his notary establish reasonable cause and exceptional circumstances for reopening regardless of timeliness, citing Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155 (BIA 1999).
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, as well as his subsequent motion to reconsider. She distinguished Matter of Cruz-Garcia, supra, from the respondent’s case. She found that the respondent had not established ineffective assistance of counsel or non-attorney fraud so as to warrant reopening. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). She concluded that the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely, his NACARA application was untimely and not supported by evidence that he is eligible for such relief, and he had not shown due diligence so as to warrant equitable tolling of the time limits for such motions.
 
On appeal, the respondent states that he is not claiming ineffective assistance. He asserts that his fear, his limited education, and his faith in the notary who deceived him amount to reasonable cause and exceptional circumstances to warrant reopening under Matter of Cruz-Garcia, supra, without regard to timeliness. We are persuaded that our decision in Matter of Cruz-Garcia, supra, is applicable here, and that the respondent’s motion is not untimely. The correct standard for reopening the respondent’s in absentia proceedings is “reasonable cause,” not “exceptional circumstances.” We find that the respondent has not demonstrated a reasonable cause for his failure to appear. Moreover, he has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for the relief he seeks, and he has not shown diligence in these proceedings. We find no basis for reopening the respondent’s deportation proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
CERTIFICATION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board when the respondent appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen her removal proceedings conducted in absentia. On November 29, 2005, we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for consideration of evidence submitted by the respondent on appeal to support her allegations that she failed to appear at her scheduled hearing of May 10, 2005, on account of the ineffective assistance of her prior attorney. On remand, the Immigration Judge noted that the directives in the Board’s decision were subject to various interpretations. Nevertheless, the Immigration Judge also noted that the respondent’s evidence was insufficient to establish her burden of proof for reopening her proceedings. Therefore, the Immigration Judge certified the case back to the Board for clarification. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
As a preliminary matter, we clarify that our intent on remanding the record to the Immigration Judge was to consider the evidence submitted by the respondent on appeal to determine whether it adequately established that she received ineffective assistance of counsel, warranting rescission of the removal order entered against her in absentia. We did not intend to reopen the proceedings without proper consideration of the evidence by the Immigration Judge.
 
Consequently, in reviewing the Immigration Judge’s ultimate conclusion that the evidence does not establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we note that neither party submitted briefs in response to the Immigration Judge’s certification of this case. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(c) and 1003.7. The Immigration Judge determined that the letter submitted by respondent’s former counsel, John F. Lenderman, in support of the respondent’s appeal, raised several questions regarding possible collusion between the respondent and counsel in making an alleged claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge’ s decision has not been shown to be clearly erroneous. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). In addition, given the respondent’s failure to meet the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s conclusion in this case. See generally Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION/APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joy H. Huang, Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sandra B, Myles
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 12, 2006, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his case following a hearing held on June 24, 1993, in which he was ordered deported in absentia, as untimely filed and failing to comply with the requirements for a claim based on ineffective assistance of counsel set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Pursuant to section 242B(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c), an order of deportation entered in absentia may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 242B(c)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3). See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to circumstances beyond the respondent’s control, such as a serious illness or the death of a member of the respondent’s immediate family. See, e.g., Mailer of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996).
 
The respondent argues on appeal that his failure to appear for his scheduled hearing was due to the ineffective assistance of his former counsel, who he later discovered was not an attorney, and that therefore the in absentia order should be rescinded due to “exceptional circumstances.” Specifically, the respondent contends that this individual not only failed to inform him that he had a scheduled hearing which resulted in the order of deportation being entered in his absence, but also advised him that his case had been closed and that he did not need to appear for any hearings.
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the circuit wherein this case arises, has held that equitable tolling of a filing deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf, Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-99 (9th Cir. 2003); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1225 (9th Cir. 2002); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1184 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999)(finding that statute of limitations for reopening an in absentia order of deportation is tolled as an equitable matter where the late filing of the motion is attributed to the deceptive actions of a notary posing as an attorney, but diligence must be shown). In the matter before us, we fail to find the respondent exercised diligence in filing his motion to reopen. His motion to reopen was filed more than 13 years after the Immigration Judge entered an in absentia deportation order. According to the respondent, a non-attorney told him “that his case was closed and that ¿heº did not need to appear in any court hearing any more.” The respondent contends that he did not learn of the Immigration Judge’ s order of deportation until he began the process to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident, based on his approved employment-related immigrant visa petition, in 2001. The respondent paid a substantial bond in order to released from detention in 1993. He fails to reveal if he took any steps to have the money returned to him in the intervening 13 years. Only after he was detained based on the outstanding order of deportation did the respondent express an interest in what had transpired 13 years before. Consequently, we find the respondent did not exercise diligence in waiting more than 13 years to investigate his immigration status. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra; Lopez v. INS, supra.
 
*2 Even if the respondent’s motion were to be accepted as having been timely filed with the Immigration Judge, it fails to even minimally assert a proper ineffective assistance claim. See Fajardo v. INS, 300 F.3d 1018, 1020-21 (9th Cir. 2002) (examining the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), in a claim of ineffective assistance by non-attorneys); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000) (substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements may be sufficient in some circumstances).
 
The respondent alleges that he wrote a letter containing his accusations of ineffective assistance to the non-attorney and contacted the California State Bar Association. However, he presented no evidence in support of the allegations. Taking such a step would have provided the non-attorney with an opportunity to provide his own version of events. Alternatively, if the mailing was returned by the postal service as undeliverable, the returned mailing would have at least supported the respondent’s claim that he could not locate him. Moreover, the respondent has not presented a copy of a contract or agreement with this individual indicating what services were to be performed by him. We therefore find that the motion provides an inadequate basis from which to conclude that the non-attorney failed to provide services that he had agreed to provide which constituted ineffective assistance and prejudiced the respondent. See generally Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004) (an inquiry into whether counsel provided ineffective assistance must begin with determining whether competent counsel would have acted otherwise before examining whether an alien was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance).
 
In addition, we find the respondent’s claims as to ineffective assistance of counsel, did not relieve him of the responsibility of notifying the Immigration Court as to any address changes. The respondent was required to provide written notice of any change in his address to the Immigration Court within 5 working days of the actual change. See 8 C.F.R. § 3.15(c)(2) (1993). The Order to Show Cause explained this requirement, and the respondent was also provided oral notice of the same in his native language. Because the respondent failed to comply with his responsibility to advise the Immigration Court of any change in address, and as the notice of hearing was sent to the most recent address provided by the respondent (and not his attorney as he claims on appeal), we conclude that the Immigration Judge was correct to proceed in absentia, and we see no reason the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order should be rescinded. See 8 C.F.R. § 3.26(b)(2)(1993); see also 8 C.F.R. § 3.26(c)(1993) (noting that written notice to the most recent address contained in the Record of Proceeding shall be considered sufficient).
 
*3 Finally, even though the respondent demonstrated that he is eligible for a form of relief from deportation which was not available at his hearing in this case adjustment of status, the respondent’s situation does not fall within the purview of our decision in Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). First, in Matter of M-S-, we held that an alien who fails to appear at his or her hearing and who had not received oral warnings of the consequences for a failure to appear, could have proceedings reopened in order to pursue a form of relief which was not available at the time of the hearing so long as the motion to reopen met the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.2(c) and 3.23(b) (1998). In this case, the certificate of service on the Order to Show Cause (form I-221) (Exh. 1) indicates that it was personally served upon the respondent and that a Service officer read the contents of the document to the respondent in Mandarin, his native language. The consequences for failing to appear at a hearing are listed on page 4 of the Order to Show Cause and therefore are part of the contents read to him. The respondent signed the form at the bottom of page 5 acknowledging that it was read and given to him. Thus, the respondent received oral notice of the consequences for failure to appear at a hearing.
 
Second, the respondent’s motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge was filed on May 2, 2006. This is a date well after the September 30, 1996, deadline for the submission of a motion to reopen proceedings in which the final administrative order from the Immigration Judge was dated June 24, 1993. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). As such, it is clearly untimely. Id.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal of the denial of his motion to reopen is dismissed.

FILE: A27 247 204 - HARLINGEN
August 22, 2006
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven P. Barsamian, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Thomas M. Bernstein
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)º - Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand; adjustment of status
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a timely appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 18, 2006, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his deportation proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is a 59-year-old native and citizen of Colombia who entered the United States without inspection on or about January 20, 1985. The respondent subsequently was placed into deportation proceedings. Although the respondent’s attorney was present at the scheduled deportation hearing on October 15, 1985, the respondent failed to appear and was ordered deported in absentia.
 
In his motion to reopen, and again on appeal, the respondent claims that he never received notice of his scheduled hearing from the Immigration Court, and moreover, was never informed by his former attorney of the scheduled hearing or of the Immigration Judge’s decision in his case. The respondent contends that he did not learn of the Immigration Judge’s order of deportation until he began the process to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident, based on his 1995 marriage to a United States citizen, in 2001.
 
Insofar as the respondent’s motion requested reopening to pursue his application for adjustment of status, such motion was untimely because it was not filed by September 30, 1996. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). We note that contrary to the respondent’s appellate arguments as to having failed to receive the “oral warnings” from the Immigration Judge as to the consequences of failing to appear at his deportation hearing, the result of this case is not guided by our decision in Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998) (Board found that an alien who did not receive oral warnings of the consequences of failing to appear at a deportation hearing held pursuant to section 242B(a) of the Act, and moves to reopen in order to apply for a form of relief that was unavailable at the time of the hearing, the rescission requirements prescribed by section 242B(c) (3) of the Act are not applicable. Instead, the motion to reopen is subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.2(c) and 3.23(b)(3) (1998)), which applies to motions to reopen under section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b, not to motions to reopen under section 242(b) of the Act.1
 
*2 The respondent also requested the reopening of his deportation proceedings, which were conducted in absentia due to his failure to appear. This portion of the motion was premised on his allegation that he did not receive proper notice of the scheduled deportation hearing in his case. We will assume for purposes of this appeal that the respondent filed the motion to reopen in a timely manner as the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(2) imposes no time or numerical limitation on aliens seeking to reopen deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act. See Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155 (BIA 1999), Matter of Mancera, 22 I&N Dec. 79 (BIA 1998) (BIA 1998) (discussing the timeliness of motions to reopen proceedings conducted in absentia under section 242(b) of the Act), reaffirmed.
 
We find that the Immigration Judge correctly concluded that the Immigration Court provided proper notice of the scheduled deportation hearing to the respondent. The Immigration Court sent written notice of the scheduled hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the respondent’s former counsel who appeared at the scheduled hearing without the respondent. Notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See sections 242(b)(1) and (2) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a)(1985); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985). Where the immigration judge concludes that notice of a hearing date has been sufficiently provided to a respondent, and the respondent without reasonable cause fails to appear, the Immigration Judge may conduct an in absentia deportation hearing. See Matter of Munoz-Santos, 20 I&N Dec. 205, 208 (BIA 1999).
 
The question remaining is whether the respondent’s claim that he failed to receive notice of his hearing was caused by the negligence of his former counsel. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must not only satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), but also the claimant must establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998). There is nothing in the record, nor has the respondent provided any evidence to suggest that his former counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. The respondent’s former attorney indicated that she sent all the notices received from the Immigration Court (e.g., notices of the scheduled deportation hearings, copy of the Immigration Judge’s decision, etc.) to the address provided to her by the respondent. She maintains that none of the communications she sent to the respondent was ever returned to her as undeliverable. In the instant case, the respondent has not complied with any of the procedural requirements for proving that his former counsel was negligent by possibly sending the respondent notice of the scheduled hearing to an incorrect address. Therefore, having failed to demonstrate that she was negligent, we cannot find that the respondent had reasonable cause for missing his hearing by virtue of his former attorney’s alleged negligence.
 
*3 Aside from his arguments regarding lack of notice, the respondent has not contended that he had any other “reasonable cause” for missing his scheduled hearing. See Matter of Ruiz, 20 I&N Dec. 91 (BIA 1989); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988); Matter of Nafi, 19 I&N Dec. 430 (BIA 1987).
 
For the aforementioned reasons, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s request to reopen these deportation proceedings.2 Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed, and the Immigration Judge’s order of deportation is left undisturbed.

In Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155, 1160 (BIA 1999), we found it unnecessary to decide whether to extend our holding in Matter of M-S-, supra, to deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act.

We observe, inter alia, as noted by the Immigration Judge in denying the respondent’s motion, the respondent “entered written pleadings to the charges in the Order to Show Cause (form I-221), admitting that he was deportable as charged and stating that he would only seek voluntary departure as relief from deportation.” Moreover, contrary to the respondent’s appellate contentions, the Immigration Judge noted that the “pleadings were signed in the original by the respondent and reflect that ¿theyº were explained to him in the Spanish language.”

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Shan D. Potts, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Arrived at a time or place not designated by the Attorney General
  
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The respondent has appealed from an Immigration Judge decision denying him any relief from removal and he has requested that the record be remanded for further proceedings based on the ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
While we agree with the respondent on appeal that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has determined that the basic requirements for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel we have laid out in the past are not sacrosanct, they still merit some consideration. See Lin v. Ashcroft, 356 F.3d 1027 (9th Cir. 2004)(considering Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988)). Under our holding in Matter of Lozada, supra, in addition to other requirements, it is incumbent on the claimant to establish that he or she suffered prejudice as a result of the attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The Ninth Circuit has stated that a respondent need only show that he has plausible grounds for relief to demonstrate he was prejudiced by the actions of counsel. This decision, however, still retains the requirement that the respondent demonstrate prejudice. See Lin v. Ashcroft, supra.
 
Here the respondent’s new counsel has simply stated that previous counsel was ineffective with no other support for this claim. It does appear from the record that there were problems with the representation. Tr. at 8. The record, however, just as easily supports the idea that the respondent, himself, failed to adequately pursue his applications for relief, as it does any ineffectiveness of counsel. We note that the respondent has made no claims with his appeal to have attempted to contact his previous counsel in the time leading up to his hearing. Further, the respondent has not explained how any ineffective assistance of counsel led him to provide false information to the Immigration Judge at the hearing below (Tr. at 9, 11-13). More important than all of this to our decision, however, is the fact that the respondent has failed to show how any alleged prior ineffective assistance of counsel has prejudiced him in anyway. He is clearly removable as charged and has not demonstrated any eligibility for cancellation of removal, having testified to first entering the country in 2005 or 2000.
 
*2 Perhaps, had the respondent been better represented, he might have been advised to provide truthful testimony regarding the date of his arrival and any past arrests. His statements in this regard appear to have incurred the ire of the Immigration Judge leading to a denial of voluntary departure. We note, however, that when asked a second time, by government counsel, the respondent was forthcoming. Further, he does, apparently, have a lawful permanent resident spouse through whom he hopes to adjust status. Given that he otherwise appears eligible for this relief (Tr. at 10-13), we will grant the respondent voluntary departure. As outlined below, however, there are very serious consequences should the respondent fail to depart pursuant to this grant of relief. In particular, we point out to the respondent that should he fail to comply with this order, he may be barred from adjusting his status to lawful permanent resident, on any basis, for the next 10 years.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed with respect to any alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The outstanding order of removal is withdrawn and in lieu of removal, and conditioned upon compliance with the provisions of the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order, or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 240.26(c) and (f). In the event that the respondent fails to depart or comply with the conditions set forth below, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent must post a voluntary departure bond in the amount of $500 with the district director within 10 business days of the date of this order. If the bond is not posted within 10 business days, the order of voluntary departure is automatically vacated on the following business day, and the respondent is ordered removed as provided by the Immigration Judge’s Order.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Cecil Harrigan, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (all respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
This case was last before us on March 29, 2006, when we dismissed the respondents’ appeal of an Immigration Judge’s written decision, dated September 6, 2005, denying their second motion to reopen, in which they claimed that they received ineffective assistance from their former attorney, S. Eric Shakir, Esquire, and through which they sought rescission of the in absentia order entered against them on July 27, 2004. The respondents have filed a timely motion to reconsider with which they have provided evidence showing that although the transmittal letter for the Immigration Judge’s decision reflects a date of September 7, 2005, the decision was actually mailed on September 12, 2005, as reflected by the postmark on the mailing envelope. As the respondents have shown that their appeal was timely filed, we will vacate our prior order and reinstate their appeal. Because our prior order was issued after the expiration of the briefing schedule, we will next address the merits of the respondents appeal.
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed with the exception of the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondents’ had not complied with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(b)(5)(C), expressly requires that a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia removal order based upon exceptional circumstances be filed within 180 days of the in absentia order. The respondents’ admittedly late filed motion to reopen therefore falls within this statutory bar and prohibits the rescission of the in absentia order.
 
Moreover, the Immigration Judge correctly found that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day statutory limit for the filing of a motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal. See Matter of A-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998); Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998).1 The language of section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act regarding the time limit within which a motion to reopen must be filed is clear on its face and unambiguous, and the statute contains no exceptions to this time bar. Id. The respondents argue that the untimeliness and number-barred status of their motion should be excused under the equitable tolling doctrine because they received ineffective assistance from former counsel and have acted diligently.2 However, neither the Board nor the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit have held that untimely motions to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal are subject to the equitable tolling doctrine. We decline to apply that doctrine in this case. Because the respondents’ motion to reopen was untimely filed before the Immigration Judge, and they have not shown “exceptional circumstances,” their appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of their second motion to reopen is dismissed.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is granted:
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s March 29, 2006, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondents’ appeal is reinstated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note that Matter of A-A-, supra, and Matter of Lei, supra, arose within the context of deportation proceedings pursuant to former section 242B of the Act. However, as section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act sets forth identical language to that contained in section 242B(c)(3), we can apply the reasoning set forth in Matter of A-A-, supra, and Matter of Lei, supra, by analogy.

Throughout these proceedings, the respondents have identified no form of relief from removal for which they are eligible and would have sought but for former counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness and the record contains no applications for relief from removal.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Charles Kuck, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Arthur S. Raznick
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of Jamaica, has appealed the Immigration Judge s decision to deny her motion to reopen. We have jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. The record is remanded.
 
The record reflects that on November 21, 2005, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States because she failed to appear for her hearing. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on December 21, 2005, but that request was denied on January 27, 2006. This timely appeal followed.
 
In the instant case, the respondent indicated that she missed her hearing on account of “exceptional circumstances.” The respondent does not dispute that she was notified of the correct date and time of the hearing. She states, however, that she mistakenly believed that her hearing was scheduled for November 21, 2005, at 4:30 p.m., rather than at 8:30 a.m. She further argues that she discussed her case with her prior attorney before the hearing, mentioned that it was set for 4:30 p.m., and her counsel did not correct her misunderstanding. The respondent further argues that her former counsel was negligent in these proceedings. The specific allegations against counsel are reflected in the respondent’s brief and motion to reopen, and need not be repeated. We further note that the respondent submitted a complaint against former counsel with the Arizona Bar Association.
 
In denying the respondent’s motion, the Immigration Judge sets forth the procedural history of the case, and notes that the respondent received notice of the hearing. The Immigration Judge does not, however, address with specificity the respondent’s argument that her good faith confusion regarding the hearing date combined with the alleged negligence of former counsel constitutes an “exceptional circumstance” to excuse her failure to appear.
 
In considering this appeal, we note our decision in Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994). Therein, we indicated that when a motion to reopen deportation proceedings is denied, the Immigration Judge must identify and fully explain the reasons for such decision; otherwise, the parties are deprived of a fair opportunity to contest the Immigration Judge’s determination on appeal, and the Board is unable to meaningfully exercise its responsibility of reviewing the decision in light of the arguments advanced on appeal. See generally also Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999).
 
In the instant case, the Immigration Judge stales in his decision that the respondent did not establish that her failure to appear for her hearing was caused by an “exceptional circumstance.” However, the Immigration Judge does not provide any analysis of the respondent’s specific arguments in support of reopening.
 
*2 Accordingly, we find it necessary to remand the record to the Immigration Judge. On remand, the Immigration Judge shall address the respondent’s arguments, and shall specifically address whether the respondent is entitled to reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec: 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) and Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004) (alien must show the outcome of a proceeding might have been affected by the negligence of counsel). The respondent and the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service, should be served with a copy of the decision and should thereafter be given an opportunity to submit briefs, in accordance with the regulations. The record should then be forwarded to the Board for further consideration.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL/MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert Allen Flynn, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Remand; waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to Section 212(c)
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s March 15, 2005, decision to deny his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). The respondent has also filed a motion to remand the record for further proceedings based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion denied.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to find that the respondent warrants a discretionary grant pursuant to section 212(c) of the Act. Notwithstanding the respondent’s appellate arguments regarding the complexity of his financial and corporate dealings, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent carries the burden of demonstrating that he is worthy of such relief as a matter of discretion. See Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581 (BIA 1978); see also Matter of Roberts, 20 I&N Dec. 294 (BIA 1991); Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191 (BIA 1990); Matter of Buscemi, 19 I&N Dec. 628 (BIA 1988). As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent has failed to take responsibility for the various financial debts with which he of his various corporations have defaulted (I.J. at 3). Moreover, the respondent has failed to make reparations therefore, even though he has professed that he has various stocks available to him and a net worth of approximately two million dollars. Lastly, the respondent appears to show no remorse for the harm he has caused, and has explained, repeatedly, that he is without fault for these numerous unpaid debts. Thus, we agree with the Immigration Judge that even though he may not have received criminal convictions for his financial dealings during the past few years, he has continued to accrue numerous civil liabilities for such transactions. Due to this ongoing behavior pattern, in conjunction with his evasive testimony and his misrepresentations regarding his parole violations, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to demonstrate that he is deserving of a discretionary grant of section 212(c) relief.
 
The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge assumed a biased and prosecutorial role during the March 15, 2005, hearing, and that his former counsel failed to object to such tactics and also failed to provide clarifying information to the Court regarding why the respondent has been subject to approximately 15 civil lawsuits. With his motion, the respondent has demonstrated that he has met the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), but he has failed to demonstrate that he experienced prejudice on account of his former attorney’s alleged deficiencies. The record indicates that the respondent received a full and fair hearing, and we do not find any evidence that the Immigration Judge acted in an unacceptable manner. See Matter of Exame, 18 I&N Dec. 303 (BIA 1982). In fact, the record indicates that the Immigration Judge continued the hearing to allow the respondent an opportunity to present further evidence in defense of the government’s allegations regarding his legal and financial issues (Tr. at 115). Accordingly, we find no reason to remand the record for further proceedings, and the motion to remand is denied.
 
*2 The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Monique Harris
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed an Immigration Judge’s March 28, 2006, order of removal. To resolve any issues regarding the timeliness of the appeal, we are reviewing this case on certification pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c). The appeal is dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he is a United States citizen and provides documentation in support of this claim. The respondent states that he was born out of wedlock on November 17, 1968, and entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident to live with his father on September 21, 1976. He also advises that his father became a naturalized United States citizen on June 9, 1975, and married a United States citizen on June 11, 1977.
 
We find that the facts presented by the respondent on appeal do not establish that the respondent derived United States citizenship from either his father or his stepmother. In order to derive United States citizenship, both of the respondent’s biological parents must have naturalized prior to his 18th birthday because the amendments to former section 321 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, created through the October 30, 2000, enactment of the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-395, 114 Stat. 1631 (“CCA”), were not retroactive. See Nehme v. INS, 252 F.3d 415 (5th Cir. 2001); Matter of Rodriguez-Tejedor, 23 I&N Dec. 153 (BIA 2001). The respondent admits that he has never known his biological mother. Thus, he cannot establish that he derived United States citizen from both of his biological parents in accordance with former section 321 of the Act. In addition, he had provided no evidence showing that his stepmother adopted him and therefore has not shown that he could have derived United States citizenship from her.
 
The respondent also argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge did not have jurisdiction over his case because the Notice to Appear was filed in Boston, Massachusetts, and venue was not properly changed to Oakdale, Louisiana. The respondent further contends that since jurisdiction in Massachusetts is proper, that the case law of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit cannot be used to support a finding of removability in his case as the law of the First Circuit should be applied.
 
*2 The record shows that the Notice to Appear was served on the respondent in Massachusetts but that the Notice to Appear was not filed with an Immigration Court until the respondent was transferred to a federal facility in Louisiana. See Exh. 1 (Notice to Appear); Form I-830 (November 2, 2005, Notice to EOIR of Alien Address). The filing of the Notice to Appear with the Oakdale Immigration Court provided the Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over the respondent’s case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.14. Where the respondent was located at the time that he was served with the Notice to Appear does not affect the Immigration Court’s jurisdiction. In addition, the information on the Notice to Appear, advising the respondent that a hearing in Boston would be set at a future date did not confer jurisdiction on the Boston Immigration Court when the document was, in fact, filed with the Oakdale Immigration Court. As jurisdiction with the Oakdale Immigration Court was proper, the Immigration Judge did not err by relying upon a precedent decision of the Fifth Circuit in finding the respondent removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.
 
The respondent additionally contends that he received ineffective assistance from his former attorney, Leo Jerome Lahey, because counsel did not object to the Immigration Cour’s jurisdiction on the grounds that the charging document had been filed in Massachusetts and the respondent had derived United States citizenship. In light of our disposition of the Immigration Court’s jurisdiction on these two issues, discussed above, we find no ineffective assistance by the respondent’s former counsel notwithstanding the respondent’s failure to comply with any of the ineffective assistance of counsel requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on February 28, 2002, when we returned the record to the Immigration Court since we are precluded by the Act from considering an appeal from an Immigration Judge’s in absentia removal order. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999). The respondent subsequently filed amotion to reopen, which was granted by the Immigration Judge on April 29, 2002. A new hearing was scheduled, but the respondent failed to appear for the hearing on January 4, 2005, and was ordered removed in absentia. On January 13, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, which was denied by the Immigration Judge. The respondent now appeals that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that she was unable to appear for her hearing as she did not have the hearing notice to gain access to the federal building where the Immigration Court is located. She asserts that the proceedings should be reopened pursuant to Twum v. INS, 411 F.3d 54 (2d cir. 2005). The respondent also asserts that she is eligible for adjustment of status pursuant to Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002).
 
The respondent has failed to establish that the proceedings must be reopened pursuant to Twum v. INS, 411 F.3d 54 (2d Cir. 2005)(IJ arbitrarily applied Lozada, and failed to consider alien’s claim that security guards’ conduct rendered his failure to appear “reasonable”). In that case, the alien argued that he established reasonable cause for his failure to appear, based on the claim in his motion to reopen and accompanying affidavit that he was prevented from attending his exclusion hearing because security guards would not admit him without a hearing notice that was in the possession of his attorney, who was inside the building. The Immigration Judge determined that the alien essentially was alleging ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), but he failed to comply with the requirements for a motion alleging ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Lozada. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the Immigration Judge abused her discretion in determining that the alien could not show “reasonable cause” for his failure to appear, since the court did not agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that alien’s claim was “in essence” one of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found that “essence” of alien’s claim was that security guards barred his entry to the court despite his assertions that he had a hearing and that his attorney had the hearing notice inside the building. The court remanded the case for further proceedings for a determination of whether the alien’s excuse offered in his affidavit was sufficient to establish reasonable cause.
 
*2 In this matter, the respondent does not contend that she failed to receive notice of her hearing. Indeed, she asserts that she arrived at the Immigration Court building to attend her hearing on January 4, 2005; but she was unable to enter the building as she did not have a copy of the notice of hearing with her. The Immigration Judge’s in absentia order was entered on January 4, 2005, but the respondent did not file a motion to reopen until January 13, 2006. Therefore, the respondent failed to file her motion to reopen within 180 days after issuance of the final order, as is required under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. Furthermore, in contrast to the alien in Twum v. INS, supra, the respondent failed to file an affidavit in support of her motion to reopen. Therefore, we find that the respondent has failed to establish that reopening in this matter is warranted based on Twum v. INS, supra.
 
The respondent also contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her motion to reopen, as she is eligible for adjustment of status under Matter of Velarde, supra. We note that Matter of Velarde, supra, did not arise in the context of in absentia proceedings. Rather, the respondent sought reopening before the Board to apply for a new form of relief within 90 days of the Board’s decision dismissing his appeal. Id. at 256. As the respondent was ordered removed in absentia, we must look to in absentia case law and statutes for guidance in this matter. In a deportation case, we found that an alien is not required to rescind his deportation order under section 242B of the Act if he is pursuing an application for new relief, and provided there is no evidence that the respondent received the required warnings under section 242B(e) of the Act. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349(BIA 1998). Section 240(b)(7) of the Act sets forth a similar limitation on discretionary relief for failing to appear at a removal hearing, as follows:
Any alien against whom a final order of removal is entered in absentia under this subsection and who, at the time of the notice described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 239(a), was provided oral notice, either in the alien’s native language or in another language the alien understands, of the time and place of the proceedings and of the consequences under this paragraph of failing, other than because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (e)(1)) to attend a proceeding under this section, shall not be eligible for relief under section 240A, 240B, 245, 248, or 249 for a period of 10 years after the date of the entry of the final order of removal.
 
 
The Notice to Appear was served personally on the respondent, and she was provided oral notice of the consequences of a failure to appear as provided in section 240(b)(7) of the Act. Consequently, it appears that the respondent is ineligible to seek adjustment of status pursuant to section 240(b)(7) of the Act. Moreover, the respondent’s motion was filed untimely. See Matter of Velarde, supra; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Finally, the respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel for her failure to appear. See Matter of Lozada, supra. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Theodore N. Cox, Esquire,
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a) 1(B)º- Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Motion to reconsider
 
This case was last before the Board on January 23, 2006, when we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings regarding the respondent’s many motions to reopen and reconsider the order of deportation entered against him in absentia on September 15, 1995. The respondent now appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 21, 2006, decision once again denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider the Immigration Judge’s August 5, 2005, decision denying his third motion to reopen his proceedings and rescind the order of deportation entered in absentia. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
This case presents a long and complex history before the Immigration Judge and this Board. Originally, the respondent was ordered removed from the United States in absencia at his scheduled hearing on September 15, 1995, when he failed to appear. On August 29, 1997, the respondent filed his first motion to reopen arguing that his failure to appear for his scheduled September 15, 1995, hearing was the result of lack of notice. This motion was denied by the Immigration Judge on January 29, 1998, when he found that both the respondent and his counsel had been properly served by certified mail with the notice of the hearing. Specifically, the Immigration Judge noted that both the respondent and his “counsel of record” had been sent hearing notices via certified mail and that each had been properly served despite the return of the respondent’s notice as “unclaimed.”
 
Subsequently, on August 16, 2004, the respondent filed his second motion to reopen alleging both lack of notice of the scheduled hearing and ineffective assistance of counsel against his former counsel. According to the respondent’s second motion, his former counsel did not in fact represent him in these proceedings as no Notice of Appearance (Form EOIR-28) was ever filed and, as such, notice to counsel was not sufficient. The respondent further noted that it was this former counsel that had provided the respondent’s “last known address” to the Immigration Court without his knowledge. This motion was denied by the Immigration Judge on September 27, 2004, when he concluded that the respondent had failed to comply with our requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), in alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Thereafter, on April 18, 2005, the respondent filed his third motion to reopen again arguing lack of notice of his September 15, 1995, hearing date and ineffective assistance of counsel. Along with his motion, the respondent provided evidence arguing that it showed his compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra. However, on May 19, 2005, the Immigration Judge, based upon the history of this case, found that the respondent’s claims of lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel were not credible and again concluded that the respondent had been properly served with notice of his original hearing when both he and his former counsel were sent notices via certified mail. On June 8, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider this decision with the Immigration Judge and on August 5, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied the motion finding the respondent incredible based upon some “material misrepresentations” found his asylum application. In particular, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had been convicted in federal court of the offense of alien smuggling and had failed to notify court of his conviction. The Immigration Judge also noted that this conviction renders the respondent ineligible for asylum. The respondent appealed this decision to the Board.
 
*2 On January 23, 2006, this Board remanded respondent’s proceedings to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings and fact-finding regarding the denial of the reapondent’s numerous motions to reopen and his motion to reconsider. Specifically the Board remanded for consideration of whether the respondent’s failure to appear in the first instance was the result of the ineffective assistance of counsel, whether the respondent’s prior motions to reopen failed as result of further ineffective assistance of counsel from various other attorneys, and whether the respondent pursued due diligence in pursuing reopening after the in absentia order to support equitable tolling under the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit’s, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, decision in Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000). On remand, the Immigration Judge issued a decision on April 21, 2006, upholding all prior decisions on the respondent’s motions and noting the respondent’s ineligibility for asylum due to his recent conviction for alien smuggling. The respondent appeals this decision.
 
Initially, we address the first issue raised by the Board in its January 23, 2006, remand regarding whether the respondent’s failure to appear in the first instance was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. In this regard, we note that in his September 27, 2004, decision denying the respondent’s first motton to reopen and rescind the in absentia order, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent had been properly served with notice of the September 15, 1995, hearing because notices are sent both to the respondent and his “counsel of record” via certified mail. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent’s notice was sent to his “last known address of record” as provided to the court by respondent’s counsel and that this notice was returned by the post office as “unclaimed.” The Immigration Judge also noted that the notice sent to the respondent’s “counsel of record” was not returned and was presumed received. However, as argued by the respondent in his second motion to reopen filed on September 16, 2004, there is no evidence in the record indicating that respondent’s counsel ever filed a Notice of Appearance with the Immigration Court. As a result, the respondent was not represented during these initial proceedings and the address of record provided for the respondent by counsel was not properly done on behalf of the respondent. As a result, it appears that the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s first motion to reopen was not entirely correct in determining that proper notice of the scheduled hearing date had been provided to the respondent.
 
In this regard, we point out that because the respondent’s change of address after he was released from detention was provided by an attorney that did not actually represent him, it was the respondent’s own responsibility to provide his change of address and to keep the Immigration Court apprized of his address immediately after being released from detention. Therefore, despite the errors in the Immigration Judge’s original September 27, 2004, determination that the respondent had been provided sufficient notice of his hearing date, we find that because the respondent failed to provide his address after his release from detention, there was no requirement that he be notified of the hearing at all. See Matter of Villalba-Sinaloa, 21 I&N Dec. 842 (BIA 1997) (if alien receives charging document but does not provide an address of record, there is no requirement that he be notified of the hearing). Thus, we agree that the respondent’s failure to appear in the first instance could not have been the result of ineffective assistance of counsel where the respondent himself concedes that he was not represented by the counsel whom he accuses of ineffectiveness and where there was no requirement of notice due to the respondent’s own failure to provide his address.
 
*3 Moreover, based upon the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the Immigration Judge’s subsequent September 27, 2004, denial of the respondent’s second motion to reopen was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. As previously noted, the respondent was not in fact represented by counsel during his initial proceedings or during the adjudication of his first motion to reopen. It would be incongruous then to find that the respondent was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel where there is no counsel of record as an attorney is only considered to be an attorney of record when a Notice of Appearance is filed, and not by the filing of any other documents on behalf of an alien. See, i.e., Singh v. INS, 315 F.3d 1186 (9th Cir. 2003). In this regard, we also cannot conclude that the Immigration Judge’s May 19, 2005, denial of the respondent’s third motion to reopen based upon his negative determination on the respondent’s credibility and his determination that notice in the first instance was proper was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. There is no evidence that counsel’s actions in filing this third motion resulted in any prejudice to the respondent where we have already determined that there was no requirement of notice to the respondent of his original hearing.
 
Based upon the foregoing, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s April 21, 2006, denial of the respondent’s motion to reconsider the Immigration Judge’s August 5, 2005, denial of his third motion to reopen, and we find it unnecessary to address whether the respondent has successfully pursued due diligence in pursuing reopening in this case sufficient to support equitable tolling of the filing deadlines under Iavorski v. INS, supra. We cannot find that the decisions rendered in this case were the result of ineffective assistance of counsel thus making a discussion under Iavorski moot.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: IVIS ESTHER FAJARDO-PEREZ
File: AXX XX6 431 - Miami
July 26, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Idalis Perez-Alvarez, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed the decision dated March 7, 2006, in which an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States, following the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing on February 6, 2002. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in determining that the illness of the respondent’s grandfather was not an “exceptional circumstance,” and in determining that the respondent did not show due diligence in trying to reopen her case. She states that after much effort to obtain legal assistance, she finally retained the services of a private attorney. However, she indicates that by the time she was able to retain a private attorney, her time to file the motion directly with the Immigration Court had expired. The respondent claims that she did everything that she was able to do to take care of her situation in Immigration Court, and asserts that she visited several non-profit organizations that decided they could not accept her case. She also states that she was unaware of the process required to reopen her case, but she did attempt to resolve the situation in the Immigration Court as soon as she learned of her order of removal; however, she did not have the proper representation to do so. The respondent avers that her due diligence in having her case reopened was affected by the ineffective assistance of her former counsel because he did not proceed with the case in a proper manner.
 
An order issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1). Furthermore, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(ii), an order of removal entered in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Act may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal, if based on exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
*2 The record reflects that the Immigration Judge entered an in absentia order of removal on February 6, 2002, and the respondent first filed a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances on January 5, 2006.¿FN1º Therefore the respondent failed to file her motion to reopen within 180 days after issuance of the order of removal, as is required under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. Moreover, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the serious illness of the respondent’s grandfather does not qualify as an “exceptional circumstance” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act, as the respondent’s grandfather did not qualify as an “immediate relative.” The respondent also failed to exercise due diligence in seeking to reopen her removal proceedings, even if she had established exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear.
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her motion to reopen on the basis of her failing to exercise due diligence in trying to reopen her case. In her appellate brief, the respondent conceded that by the time she was able to retain a private attorney, her time to file the motion directly with the Immigration Court had expired. The respondent failed to submit an affidavit setting forth in detail her efforts to reopen her case after receiving the in absentia order of removal in February 2002. In the affidavit submitted with her motion to reopen, the respondent fails to address her efforts to seek legal assistance and actually states that after receiving the in absentia order of removal, she was “in a great amount of grief that left me numb and unable to care for my own affairs.” Therefore, it is unknown exactly when the respondent began to seek legal assistance subsequent to receiving the in absentia order of removal. Moreover, although the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel in her motion to reconsider based on her former counsel’s failure to properly seek reopening of her proceedings, she failed to comply with any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).¿FN2º The respondent also claims on appeal that she was unaware of the process required to reopen her case and that she did everything that she was able to do to take care of her situation in Immigration Court, yet there is no indication that the respondent ever contacted the Immigration Court after receiving the in absentia order of removal to determine the proper procedure to seek reopening of her proceedings. Consequently, the respondent failed to establish that she exercised due diligence in seeking to reopen her proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

In its opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) indicates that the respondent filed joint motions to reopen with the Miami Immigration Court on January 5, 2006, January 10, 2006, and January 12, 2006. However, the DHS states that it is their policy and practice to have either the Chief Counsel and/or the office’s Deputy Chief Counsels sign a proposed Joint Motion to Reopen. The DHS asserts that it cannot identify the signatures on behalf of DHS found on the motions. Furthermore, the motions allegedly signed by the DHS contradict the December 12, 2005, letter declining to join in the reopening of these proceedings. See DHS Response to Motion to Reopen.

In her appellate brief, the respondent states that her motion to reconsider was not based on ineffective assistance of counsel and she did not comply with the Lozada requirements because counsel was disbarred on February 27, 2006. However, to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent was still required to comply with the requirements of Lozada. Nor did the respondent submit any evidence that her former counsel was disbarred.

IN RE: ZLATA ILIC LEE

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marshal E. Hyman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mark J. Jebson
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on March 22, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision to deny her request for a continuance to await the processing of her husband’s I-130 petition. The respondent, through new counsel, has filed a motion to reopen based on the same I-130 petition. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a response in opposition. The motion will be denied.
 
A party seeking to reopen removal proceedings must state the new facts she intends to establish, supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c), 1003.23(b)(3) (2006) INS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450 U.S. 139 (1981); Matter of Leon-Orosco and Rodriguez-Colas, 19 I&N Dec. 136 (BIA 1984; A.G. 1984); Matter of Reyes, 18 I&N Dec. 249 (BIA 1982). A motion to reopen will not be granted unless it establishes a prima facie case of statutory and discretionary eligibility for the underlying substantive relief sought. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). A motion is not an opportunity to present previously available arguments, to repeat previously considered and rejected arguments, or to make new or alternative requests for previously available relief.
 
By way of background, the respondent has been seeking adjustment of status based on her marriage in 2000 to a United States citizen, who submitted a second I-130 petition on her behalf in January 2005. Her husband’s first petition had been denied in October 2003. On March 22, 2006, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision to deny her request for a continuance to await the processing of her husband’s second I-130 petition. The respondent indicated that she had filed a motion to reopen the denial of her husband’s first visa petition in November 2003, and that the motion remained pending with Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) at the time of our previous decision. Also on March 22, 2006, we sustained the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision to deny a motion to reopen for the purpose of applying for adjustment of status because the Immigration Judge did not have jurisdiction to decide the motion to reopen after the respondent had filed an appeal with the Board.
 
*2 In the instant motion to reopen, the respondent has obtained new counsel who requests reopening on the basis of “new” evidence submitted to substantiate the bona fides of the marriage. He indicates that the second visa petition submitted by the respondent’s husband remains pending, and that CIS has not rendered a decision on the motion to reopen the first visa petition.¿FN1º The DHS has filed a response in opposition.
 
Upon review, the motion will be denied. We note that the respondent has not satisfied the standards for reopening because she has not established that she is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status. In this regard, we observe that her husband’s visa petition has not been approved, and that the motion to reopen the denial of the first visa petition remains pending with CIS. Furthermore, counsel has attached minimal and insufficient documentation to the motion to establish the bona tides of the marriage.¿FN2º 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c), 1003.23(b)(3); Matter of Velarde 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). Therefore, the respondent has not satisfied the requirements for reopening under the applicable regulations and precedent. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Finally, to the extent that present counsel alleges in the instant motion that the respondent’s previous attorney committed ineffective assistance of counsel, we observe that the respondent has not attempted to comply in any fashion with the Board’s requirements for making a valid ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

For purposes of completeness, we note that present counsel incorrectly states in his motion that we dismissed both of the respondent’s appeals on March 22, 2006, and that we “did not consider the effect of the new I-130 petition on the proceedings.”

2

In this regard, we observe that counsel has attached to the instant motion a copy of the marriage certificate for the respondent and her husband, an undated letter from a mortgage broker, and photocopies of photographs of what is presumably the respondent and her husband, although counsel has not provided any captions or other identifying information to indicate the names of the individuals depicted in the photographs, or the time and place of the photographs.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Micaela M. Alvarez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Janice Montana
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
 
  
APPLICATION: 212(i) waiver
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the April 1, 2005, decision of the Immigration Judge insofar as she deemed abandoned the respondent’s application for a waiver under section 212(i) of the Act because he failed to timely submit the required supplemental documents. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872 (BIA 1994) (noting that the adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge in whole or in part is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). On appeal, the respondent’s counsel has alleged that the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny a request for a continuance to permit the respondent an opportunity to file the required supplemental documents constitutes a denial of due process and deprived the respondent of a fair hearing. In this regard, we observe that the decision to grant or deny a request for a continuance is wholly within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, and the decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of due process. Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987). See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6 (2006). We are not persuaded by the arguments advanced on appeal that the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny a request for a continuance constituted an abuse of discretion, or that her decision to deny the requested relief was clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(i).
 
In addition, counsel maintains on appeal that the respondent’s prior counsel committed ineffective assistance of counsel because he failed to file the specified supplemental documents in a timely fashion, and he did not appear in person at the final hearing because of a family emergency (although he did appear telephonically). In this regard, we find that the respondent has not complied with the Board’s requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel because he has not notified his prior counsel about his allegations, and he has not filed a complaint with the appropriate state bar against his prior counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1 st Cir. 1988).
 
*2 Finally, counsel has submitted new evidence on appeal in the form of some of the missing documents (affidavit of support, and federal tax returns) and he requests reopening to permit the respondent to pursue his waiver application. We observe that our review is a review on the record. See Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988). Therefore, we do not consider new evidence submitted on appeal except insofar as is necessary to determine whether a motion to reopen is to be granted. In the instant case, we find that the allegations and submissions on appeal do not meet the requirements for such a motion because the respondent has not established that the documents submitted on appeal were not previously available. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, and the motion is denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard E. Esquivel, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kuyomars Golparvar
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The respondent timely appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 25, 2006, decision. The respondent argues on appeal that his case should be remanded to the Immigration Judge for a new hearing because he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his prior hearing. The Department of Homeland Security (the DHS) argues that the Immigration Judge’s decision was correct and should be summarily affirmed. The respondent’s request for a remand will be granted.
 
The respondent claims that his former counsel erred by admitting factual allegations on the Notice to Appear that the respondent had not committed. A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). An alien must also show that the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case and that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the jurisdiction under which this case arises, has found, however, that aliens need not strictly adhere to the requirements of Matter of Lozada, especially when there is a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” See, e.g., Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
The respondent submitted sufficient evidence with his brief to establish compliance with the basic Matter of Lozada requirements. In order to present a successful motion based upon prior ineffective assistance of counsel, however, the respondent must also show that he suffered prejudice. As described above, the respondent claims that he suffered prejudice because his prior attorney erroneously admitted factual allegations on the Notice to Appear, which resulted in the Immigration Judge finding that the respondent is removable as charged. The Immigration Judge’s decision indeed reveals that the Immigration Judge would not have sustained the charge of removability had the respondent’s former attorney not admitted allegations 6 and 7 in their entireties (I.J. at 3).
 
*2 Inasmuch as the respondent has submitted evidence establishing that he may not be removable as charged, we will find that the respondent suffered prejudice as a result of his former counsel’s ineffective assistance, and will therefore remand proceedings to the Immigration Judge for adjudication of his claim on these new facts.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing order.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on September 30, 2005, when we adopted and affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on October 28, 2004.¿FN1º On April 10, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen claiming that he received ineffective assistance from his three former attorneys and was prejudiced thereby thus warranting the reopening of proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a response in opposition to the motion. The motion to reopen is denied.
 
In his motion, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from Marshall Hong, Esquire, who did not advise him of the consequences of failing to appear at his October 28, 2004, hearing after he informed counsel that he would miss his hearing because he was traveling to Texas to visit a close family friend who was dying. He states that he informed counsel two days before his hearing of the status of his friend and was told that counsel would seek a continuance and informed that it would be okay to miss the hearing since it was only a master calendar hearing and the respondent had an approved employment petition and pending adjustment of status application. The respondent states that after listening to the transcript of his hearing, he learned that counsel did not inform the Immigration Judge of the reasons for the respondent’s failure to appear or of his advice to the respondent to visit his friend rather than appear for his hearing. The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge’s statement that counsel informed him to do what was necessary so as to attend his hearing was incorrect as counsel had not so advised him. The respondent also contends that Mr. Hong promptly informed him of the in absentia order and stated that he would file a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge but had not done so two months after the entry of the in absentia order.
 
The respondent also argues that he received ineffective assistance from Alexandra D. Baranyk, Esquire, and Susan Fortino-Brown, Esquire, who represented him on his motion to reopen which was filed with the Immigration Judge, because they did not raise the issue of the ineffectiveness of his former counsel in the motion to reopen. He asserts that this error resulted in the Board’s noting in its dismissal of his appeal that he had not complied with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. He contends that these attorneys informed him in October 2005 that they would not continue to represent him whereupon he sought additional counsel but was unable to find counsel until retaining present counsel.
 
*2 The motion to reopen is untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of our decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Therefore, we next examine whether the respondent’s motion is subject to the equitable tolling doctrine. See Pervaiz v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 488, 490 (7th Cir. 2005) (holding that equitable tolling for untimely motions is available where an alien was ordered removed in absentia where the alien establishes that he or she filed the motion within a reasonable time). We find that the respondent has shown that he exercised due diligence regarding his claim against Mr. Hong. He sought and obtained new counsel, Ms. Baranyk, who filed a motion to reopen and appeal on his behalf. He states that between October 2005 when she ceased to represent him, that he sought out additional representation but was turned down by three attorneys until present counsel agreed to represent him regarding the actions of Mr. Hong, Ms. Baranyk, and Ms. Fortino-Brown, and then filed the instant motion in April 2006. Having established that equitable tolling of the time limits for the filing of motions to reopen is applicable in this case, we next turn to the merits of the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
 
The respondent has not complied with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent has not provided copies of his representation agreement with any of the attorneys who are the subject of his present motion. Thus, we cannot ascertain the scope of the work that each was to perform. This is important in the case of Mr. Hong because we do not know if he was retained to file a motion to reopen. All that we know is that he said that he could file one but didn’t — whether this failure was due to ineffectiveness or because he had not been retained to do so cannot be determined from the record. The absence of a representation agreement with Ms. Baranyk and Ms. Fortino-Brown would help the Board to determine who was responsible for the respondent’s case. Ms. Branayk is represented the respondent before the Immigration Judge and the Board whereas Ms. Fortino-Brown never entered an appearance before either the Immigration Judge or the Board. The respondent states that he met with both women at his initial meeting but the absence of a notice of appearance or any filings from Ms. Fortino-Brown makes her role in the respondent’s case almost impossible to ascertain absent a retainer agreement which sets forth her role and obligations towards the respondent.
 
In addition, although the respondent provided evidence showing that he filed complaints against Mr. Hong, Ms. Baranyk, and Ms. Fortino-Brown with the Illinois state bar disciplinary authorities, he has not provided any evidence showing that he informed each of those attorneys of his complaint. Although counsel for the respondent states that a copy of the complaint was sent to each attorney (Resp. Mot. at 8), statements of counsel are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). As the respondent has submitted no evidence showing that the three attorneys were advised of his complaint, we have no evidence establishing that they are aware of the ineffective assistance claim that he is making against them in his removal proceedings. They have therefore not been provided with a meaningful opportunity to respond. Because the respondent has not complied with the Lozada requirements, the motion to reopen is denied.
 
*3 The respondent also requests that we reopen proceedings and rescind the in absentia order sua sponte. We decline to reopen proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Grisel Ybarra, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of Status
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s February 23, 2005, decision pretermitting the respondent’s application for adjustment of status Pursuant to section 202 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 (NACARA), Pub. L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160, based on her failure to file required evidence supporting that application in a timely manner.
 
Applications for benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act are properly denied as abandoned when the applicant fails to file required evidence by court-imposed deadlines. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (2005); Matter of Shanu, 23 I&N Dec. 754, 764 (BIA 2005). As an applicant for adjustment of status under NACARA § 202, the respondent was obliged to file evidence in Immigration Court proving that she had been physically present in the United States for a continuous period beginning not later than December 1, 1995. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.13(a)(2). Moreover, pursuant to Rule 2.D of the Revised Local Operating Procedures of the Miami Immigration Court, such evidence was required to be filed at least 10 days in advance of the respondent’s individual calendar hearing, so that the court and government counsel could have a reasonable opportunity to review it before the merits hearing. See Matter of Shanu, supra, at 765 & n.8. Yet the respondent neither filed the evidence by the deadline nor made a timely request for an extension. Instead, she simply appeared in court on the date of her individual calendar hearing and attempted to have the exhibits placed into evidence at that time. When the Immigration Judge asked the respondent’s attorney why the documents were not filed in compliance with the 10-day rule, her only response was that her office did not have the evidence ready by that deadline. (Tr. at 6).
 
Under the circumstances, we conclude that the Immigration Judge acted within the scope of his discretion when he deemed the respondent’s application for NACARA adjustment abandoned. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). The respondent has not argued that her default was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel, see generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and therefore we have no present occasion to express an opinion with respect to that issue.
 
*2 The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: LUCINEIA FRANCA
File: AXX XX5 227 - Seattle

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio Salazar, Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margaret Rosenast
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated February 23, 2006. In her motion the respondent avers that her former representative afforded her ineffective assistance of counsel as she failed to apply for relief pursuant to Virk v. INS, 295 F.3d 1055 (9th Cir. 2002), “which would have allowed the alien to continue to reside lawfully in the United States” (Motion at 4). She also argues that counsel erred by appealing the denial of the visa petition filed on her behalf to this Board, and not the Administrative Appeals Unit of the Department of Homeland Security. While the respondent concedes that she has not complied with all the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), she essentially maintains that she need not file a bar complaint against former counsel as she has “substantially complied” with the same per Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000), although she has not identified how she has “complied” with the relevant requirements, other than merely setting forth her claim.
 
We recognize in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where this case arises, the factors enumerated in Matter of Lozada, supra, “are not rigidly applied, especially when the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F. 3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002). Noncompliance with Matter of Lozada may be excused where “both … an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and … the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra at 526.
 
However, we do not find that such a situation is presented here. As noted, the respondent cites Virk v. INS, supra, as establishing that she had a right to remain in the United States that her former counsel failed to exercise. However, that decision does not stand for that proposition. In Virk v. INS, the respondent’s claim was before the Board on a motion to reopen, not a direct appeal, unlike the respondent’s situation. As such, different standards and burdens of proof were applicable. Moreover, that case stands for the proposition that the denial of a motion to reopen should be remanded if the BIA has not considered all relevant factors. See, e.g., Virk v. INS, supra at 1060 (remanding where the Board did not consider factors in petitioner’s favor, and where it considered an irrelevant factor). Finally, as DHS counsel notes in her opposition, the facts in that case were wholly different from that of the respondent. Unlike the alien in that case, the respondent has not already obtained lawful permanent resident status. Moreover, the respondent is ineligible for the waiver she seeks as she was not admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident and the fraud that was committed was not pursuant to her admission at that time. See section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act. Thus, we are unable to ascertain the relevancy of this case, and find no evidence of ineffective counsel in this regard.
 
*2 We also find perplexing and unavailing the respondent’s arguments alleging that her counsel erred by “improperly appeal[ing] the denial of the I-130 petition filed by the second spouse to the BIA, rather than to the Administrative Appeals Unit” (Motion, memo. at 2). During the proceedings below the respondent sought only a continuance pending the appeal of the denial of a visa petition filed on her behalf (Tr. at 2-3). It appears that the appeal of this decision was pending before the Board (Tr. at 3). In fact, the respondent recently submitted a copy of her former counsel’s rebuttal to her allegations of ineffective assistance. The attorney reported that, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a)(2), she correctly submitted an appeal of the denial of the visa petition filed on her behalf with this Board, accompanied by a motion and memorandum. The record also corroborates the attorney’s refutation of the respondent’s claim that she failed to address the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion for a continuance. Rather, the first issue addressed in the respondent’s brief on appeal submitted by former counsel is whether the Immigration Judge erred in denying the requested continuance (Respondent’s Br. at 1; Motion, memo. at 2). As such, the respondent’s allegations of error in this regard are baseless. In light of the noted defects in the respondent’s motion, she was not exempt from complying with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra at 526. Given the procedural and substantive deficiencies in the respondent’s motion, reopening is not warranted. Id.; 8 C.F.R § 1003.2(c).
 
Finally, we note that the respondent references unspecified “significant new and material information” that was not previously unavailable and which related to relief from removal (Motion at 1-2). However, she has not identified either what evidence she wishes to submit, or what relief for which she is eligible. Therefore, reopening on this basis is not appropriate.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN RE: MIRZA TAHIR BAIG
File: AXX XX2 449 - Houston

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Imdad A. Seehar, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Erica J. McGuirk
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand; adjustment of status
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on February 2, 2006, when we dismissed, without separate opinion, the respondent’s appeal from the denial of his application for voluntary departure and request for adjustment of status through his United States citizen wife. The record is remanded further proceedings and entry of a new decision.
 
The respondent moved to reopen and remand the case for adjustment of status arguing that his prior counsel incorrectly informed the Immigration Judge on December 22, 2004, that his visa petition had been denied and asserts that this error prejudiced his claim and constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. In the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen, the DHS indicated that it confirmed the respondent’s visa petition has not been finally denied and that Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) had thus far only issued a Notice of Intent to Deny dated November 5, 2004. The DHS argued that the respondent represented in his motion that his wife, the petitioner, filed a response to the Notice of Intent to Deny, however, he failed to attach proof of service of these documents on CIS. DHS’s Opposition to the Respondent’s Motion at 2. The DHS asserted that given the current posture of the respondent’s visa petition application, he has not demonstrated that it is likely to be approved and thus he has not shown that he is likely to be eligible for adjustment of status. Id.
 
The record shows that the respondent’s prior counsel informed the Immigration Court that the respondent’s 1-130 visa application had been denied (Tr. at 17). Based on the Notice of Intent to Deny (Exh. 2) and the respondent’s former counsel’s inaccurate statement that the visa petition had been denied, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was ineligible to adjust his status and for voluntary departure because he entered into a fraudulent marriage and cannot show good moral character during the required period (Exh. 2). See I.J. at 2-3. The respondent supported his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with affidavits, provided prior counsel notice and opportunity to respond to the allegation levied against him, and the respondent filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 638 (BIA 1988). The misstatement by the respondent’s prior counsel was prejudicial to the respondent’s case and constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. See De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir.2004) (to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, alien must demonstrate counsel’s performance resulted in substantial prejudice); Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir.2001) (same). Where the Immigration Judge’s decision is based on materially inaccurate information provided by the respondent’s prior counsel, ineffective assistance of counsel is shown and we will remand the case for further proceedings, updated factual findings, and entry of a new decision. Accordingly, the record is remanded for further proceedings to consider the respondent’s applications for adjustment of status and voluntary departure. Although we find it appropriate to issue an order remanding the record, we take no position on the ultimate merits of the respondent’s future applications for relief.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is hereby granted and the record is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.

IN RE: HARVEY ANTONIO SALAZAR
File: AXX XX9 372 - Eloy
June 29, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John M. Pope, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kuyomars Golparvar
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; voluntary departure
 
In a decision dated March 27, 2006, an Immigration Judge sustained the charge of deportability against the respondent, pretermitted his applications for relief from removal on grounds of abandonment, and ordered him removed from the United States. On April 21, 2006, the respondent moved to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b), but the Immigration Judge denied the motion in a decision dated April 26, 2006. The respondent now appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be sustained, the removal proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nicaragua and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, is removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), on the basis of his April 2005 California conviction for possession of cocaine base.1 During his proceedings before the Immigration Judge, the respondent requested an opportunity to apply for relief from removal in the form of cancellation of removal and voluntary departure under sections 240A(a) and 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(a) and 1229c(b). However, the respondent’s former attorney—Joseph Siguenza, Esquire—failed to file the applications for relief by the court-imposed deadline of March 13, 2006. Consequently, the applications were deemed abandoned pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) and the respondent was ordered removed as charged on March 27, 2006.
 
The respondent, represented by new counsel, filed a timely motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge requesting an opportunity to file his relief applications out of time and alleging that attorney Siguenza may have provided ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to file the applications in a timely manner. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, holding that the respondent’s allegations did not establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and that the respondent had not demonstrated prejudice arising from his default. The respondent appeals, arguing that attorney Siguenza’s unexplained failure to file the respondent’s relief applications in a timely manner was ineffective assistance on its face that prejudiced the respondent by depriving him of an opportunity of securing relief that would have allowed him to remain in the United States.
 
*2 The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this proceeding arises, has held on numerous occasions that an attorney’s unexplained failure to meet a client’s mandatory filing deadlines constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel where the failure to file results in a default, essentially forfeiting the client’s opportunity to pursue avenues of relief that would otherwise have been open to him. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 900-01 (9th Cir. 2003); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226 (9th Cir. 2002); Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1044-45 (9th Cir. 2000); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit has held that such untimely filing—when inadequately explained—constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel on its face, so as to warrant reopening despite the respondent’s failure to comply with the formal procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, supra, at 1226-27; Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra, at 526-27.
 
In this instance, it is evident from the face of the record that attorney Siguenza did not attempt to file the respondent’s applications for relief until March 22, 2006, some nine days after the court-imposed deadline of March 13, 2006. Moreover, although attorney Siguenza explained that his failure to file the applications in a timely manner was due to the pressures of his workload, time-management problems or an overextended practice cannot justify defective representation. Finally, the untimeliness of the applications obviously prejudiced the respondent by causing him to forfeit his right to seek relief for which he was prima facie eligible. Under the circumstances, we agree with the respondent that attorney Siguenza provided ineffective assistance of counsel that compromised respondent’s right to a full and fair hearing. The appropriate remedy in such a case is to reopen the removal proceedings so that the respondent may have an opportunity to apply for the relief which he would have requested but for Siguenza’s default.
 
On remand, the respondent should be given an opportunity to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act and voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act. We note, however, that his conviction for possession of cocaine base may well trigger the aggravated felony bar of section 240A(a)(3) and the good moral character bar of section 240B(b)(1)(B) of the Act. See also section 101(f)(8) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)(8) (indicating that an alien convicted of an aggravated felony is precluded from establishing good moral character). In this connection, we note that possession of a mixture or substance containing more than 5 grams of cocaine base is a felony under the Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 844(a), and therefore a state conviction for such an offense would qualify as an aggravated felony for immigration purposes under the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, 356 F.3d 1015 (9th Cir. 2004). Because the evidence indicates that the aforementioned grounds of mandatory denial may apply to the respondent, he shall have the burden on remand of proving that his crime does not constitute an aggravated felony. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). The Government need not prove that it does.
 
*3 The following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the Immigration Judge’s April 26, 2006, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen is vacated, and the removal proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

Before the Immigration Judge, the respondent invoked Lujan-Armendariz v. INS, 222 F.3d 728 (9th Cir. 2000), and argued that this conviction did not render him removable. The Immigration Judge rejected the respondent’s challenge to the charge of removability, however, relying on the Ninth Circuit’s subsequent decision in Chavez-Perez v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 1284 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent has not appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision sustaining the charge of deportability, nor has he challenged that deportability finding in connection with his motion to reopen. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s decision is now final with respect to the deportability issue.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nikki Jacobson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Monica Mubaraki
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)] - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Termination; voluntary departure
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
To the extent that the respondent contends on appeal that she informed her former counsel that her testimony to immigration officials at the border was coerced or involuntary and that her former counsel nevertheless failed to present evidence to rebut the allegations against her, the respondent has not attempted to meet the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); see generally Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
Furthermore, we reject the respondent’s contention on appeal that the Immigration Judge should have fully developed the record on the issue of coercion and that the Immigration Judge did not allow her to present evidence on her own behalf. The respondent in this case was represented by counsel. At the respondent’s November 17, 2005, hearing, counsel for the Department of Homeland Security (“the DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service), stated that the respondent’s counsel informed him that the respondent was not going forward on the assertion that her statement to immigration officials was involuntary. See Tr. at 24-25. The respondent’s counsel did not dispute this statement. Moreover, after the DHS rested on the evidence presented, the Immigration Judge specifically inquired as to whether the respondent’s counsel wished to call any witnesses to rebut the DHS’s evidence, to which the respondent’s counsel replied that he did not. See Tr. at 25. In the face of these statements, we do not find that the Immigration Judge was required to further develop the record on the issue of coercion or that the Immigration Judge otherwise conducted proceedings in a manner that deprived the respondent of a full and fair hearing.
 
Additionally, as the respondent has not asserted that she is eligible for any form of relief from removal, we reject the respondent’s contention that she was prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s failure to explain the standard of proof for any available forms of relief. Moreover, we note that the respondent’s counsel agreed that the respondent was ineligible for relief under section 240A(a) of the Immigration Nationality Act (“the Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), and indicated that the respondent did not wish to pursue any other form of relief from removal. See Tr. at 27-28.
 
*2 Finally, to the extent that the respondent requests voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), for the first time on appeal, the respondent’s request will be denied. The respondent is ineligible for voluntary departure in that she has been found to be a member of a class of persons described in section 212(a)(6)(E) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E), and is thus prevented from establishing that she has been a person of good moral character during the last 5 years. See sections 101(a)(f)(3) and 240B(b)(1)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(f)(3), 1229c(b)(1)(B).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: RODNEY ALFRED BUSTILLO
File: AXX XX5 551 - Boston
June 26, 2006
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted aggravated felony
Sec. 241(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on October 18, 2005, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. On May 12, 2006, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen. The respondent motion to reopen is time and number barred under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings, whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge, and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened). The final administrative order in this case was entered on October 13, 2004, when we sustained the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) appeal, vacated the Immigration Judge’s May 27, 2004, decision granting the respondent relief under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), and ordered the respondent deported to Honduras.
 
The instant motion to reopen is premised on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel by two attorneys who allegedly represented the respondent, Ms. Kerry Doyle and Mr. George Babcock. The respondent’s motion is supported by letters he received from these two attorneys in 2004. Although the respondent has not provided the letters he sent to Ms. Doyle and Mr. Babcock, both these attorneys challenge allegations the respondent apparently made. The respondent has not provided a detailed statement of their alleged misconduct. Rather, he makes generalized assertions that they did not file briefs with this Board. Ms. Doyle states that she did not represent the respondent. Indeed, there is no notice of appearance filed by Ms. Doyle in this case. Regarding Mr. Babcock he entered his appearance as attorney when he filed a motion to reopen on behalf of the respondent. The respondent has not established that he filed a bar complaint against either of these attorneys. Thus, the respondent’s motion will also be denied based on his failure to comply with the procedures we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Additionally, even if the motions filing deadline could be equitably tolled, the respondent has failed to exercise due diligence in asserting his ineffective assistance of counsel claims. In Cai Xing Chen v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 151 (1st Cir. 2005), the First Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this ease arises, held that the Board correctly found the alien’s second motion to reopen, and first to raise the ineffective assistance claim, to be number barred but then stated that it has identified five factors to be used when evaluating equitably tolling for an ineffective assistance claim: “(1) a lack of actual notice of a time limit: (2) a lack of constructive notice of a time limit; (3) diligence in the pursuit of one’s rights: (4) an absence of prejudice to a party opponent; and (5) the claimant’s reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the time limit.” Id. at 154. As noted above, the respondent offers no reason why he could not have raised these claims in his first motion to reopen. Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Noemi G. Ramirez, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled (both respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondents move the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel.1 The motion is denied.
 
The respondents’ motion is barred by the time and numerical limitations for motions to reopen set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The regulations provide that a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision is rendered and that a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings, whether before the Immigration Judge or the Board. Id. In this case, the Immigration Judge rendered the final administrative decision in the respondents’ proceedings on June 6, 2005. The respondents’ motion to reopen, however, was not filed until May 4, 2006. Moreover, the respondents filed a prior motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge on August 8, 2005, which was denied on November 3, 2005.
 
Although the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (“Ninth Circuit”) has held that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies to toll the time limitation for motions to reopen during periods when a respondent is prevented from filing a motion because of deception, fraud, or error, provided that the respondent acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error, we do not find that the doctrine applies in the case at hand. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). See also Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir.2002); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). The respondents in the present matter have failed to substantially comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Specifically, the respondents’ motion is not accompanied by a detailed affidavit describing their agreement with counsel. See Matter of Lozada, supra. Moreover, the respondents have failed to establish whether a complaint has been filed against counsel with the appropriate disciplinary authority, and if not, why not. Id.
 
*2 We observe that the attorney representing the respondents in their present motion is the same attorney against whom the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is made. We note that attorneys raising claims relating to their own ineffectiveness are not exempt from the reporting requirement set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See generally Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 825 (9th Cir. 2003) (noting that attorney who had self-reported his own alleged ineffectiveness demonstrated that counsel had taken his error in failing to file an appeal brief as a serious breach of the services he had promised to alien client). The purpose of the reporting requirement is to highlight the standards which are expected of attorneys appearing before the Board and the Immigration Courts, while underscoring that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel should reflect the serious nature of such allegations. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, supra, at 825.
 
Furthermore, the respondents have failed to establish that they were prejudiced by the actions of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640; see also Matter of Assaad, supra, at 556. Although the respondents generally assert that counsel erred in failing to file their prior motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge before the expiration of their voluntary departure period, the respondents have not articulated any harm or prejudice that resulted from counsel’s late-filing. As we indicated in the second paragraph of our March 31, 2006, decision, the respondents were not eligible for the form of relief sought in their prior motion regardless of the date that the motion was filed. Moreover, the respondents have not asserted that they are presently eligible for any such relief.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

Although titled as a “motion to reconsider,” the respondent’s motion is, in substance, a motion to reopen and has been adjudicated in accordance with the regulations governing such motions.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Johnson, Wade, Esq.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated March 22, 2006, in which we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion to remand. The respondent must make a prima facie showing that he is eligible as a matter of law for the relief sought upon reopening and that such relief would likely be granted in the exercise of discretion. Matter of Rodriguez-Vera, 17 I & N Dec. 105 (BIA 1979). A party who seeks to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). That burden has not been met. The respondent has failed to establish his prima facie eligibility for relief. The evidence presented was available previously and is not new. The respondent has also not submitted proof of an approved visa petition.1 The respondent further appears ineligible for adjustment of status under §240B(d), because he did not comply with the Board’s last order granting 60 days voluntary departure.2 As the respondent’s motion is not supported by evidence of prima facie eligibility for relief, it will be denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
The respondent also suggests ineffective assistance of his prior counsel. However, he has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), which requires that the alien must layout, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

The respondent’s motion reflects that DHS previously denied his current spouse’s I-130 under §204(c), based upon a finding of fraud in a prior marriage. Thus, he does not have an immigrant visa immediately available to him, and the indication in the Form I-485 (submitted with the motion) that a visa petition was approved is incorrect.

2

Pursuant section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), an alien who fails to depart following a grant of voluntary departure, and who has been provided written notice of the consequences of remaining in the United States, is statutorily barred from applying for certain forms of discretionary relief. We find that the respondent is barred from applying for adjustment of status by section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d). An alien who remains in the United States after the scheduled date of departure is statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief. Therefore, because the respondent has remained in the United States after the scheduled date of departure, the respondent is now statutorily ineligible for the relief sought.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sandra Greene, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopen and reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent moves to reopen and reconsider our decision dated April 27, 2006, dismissing his appeal from an Immigration Judge’s November 30, 2005, order of removal against him. The respondent contends that on May 11, 2006, his 2001 conviction for marijuana possession was vacated. However, the respondent has only submitted a rather poor quality copy of a court document that apparently does not on its face establish that the conviction was vacated. Even assuming that the conviction was vacated, the respondent has not presented evidence demonstrating whether his plea of guilty was vacated for “reasons solely related to rehabilitation or immigration hardships” or “on the basis of a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.” See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). Concerning the motion to reconsider, the respondent has failed to establish that we erred in dismissing his appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The respondent is merely reiterating contentions considered previously. The respondent does take issue with the assertion in our last decision that we found that his numerous filings before the Immigration Judge bordered on frivolous, and that none of the Immigration Judge’s rulings contained error within our standard of review. We found that the respondent’s motion for recusal included widespread, far-reaching allegations of misconduct involving alleged incidents wholly unsupported by the record, and even less germane to the issues related to the instant case. The respondent argues that a three member decision which dismissed his bond appeal on April 27, 2006, referred present counsel’s complaints and her factual statements to this agency’s office of General Counsel for further investigation. Even in the bond decision, however, we found that the evidence of record did not support the respondent’s complaint against the Immigration Judge. The respondent has also attached letters which appear to indicate that he considers himself to be a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, but he has not filed such a motion or complied with the procedural requirements, see Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jim Salvator, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Donald C. O’Hare
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)º - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on October 24, 2005, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s April 6, 2005, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen to afford him the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status. On March 2, 2006, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen again seeking the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is time and number barred under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings, whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge, and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened). On November 4, 2004, the Immigration Judge entered a final order in this case. The respondent previously filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on March 17, 2005.
 
Despite the respondent’s assertions to the contrary, he remains statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), because he failed to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified. The respondent seeks to excuse his failure to depart by blaming his prior counsel, Dr. Khanna, and asserting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Although the respondent has substantially complied with the procedural steps set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), he has failed to establish that Dr. Khanna actually prejudiced his case. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent was personally served with the Immigration Judge’s November 4, 2004, decision granting him voluntary departure and warning him about the adverse consequences should he fail to depart. Even if Dr. Khanna misadvised the respondent, the respondent has failed to establish that he was not advised of the privilege of voluntary departure and the consequences of failing to depart.
 
Finally, the respondent’s assertion that he is “stateless” is now moot. The Department of Homeland Security has proffered a copy of the respondent’s recently issued travel document. Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Evelyn G. Zneimer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF DHS:
 
Janet Muller
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
Sec. 212(a)(9)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(A)(i)º - Previously ordered removed at arrival
 
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated July 19, 2005, in which the Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal and pretermitted his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The charges in the respondent’s Notice to Appear (“NTA”) include allegations that the respondent was ordered removed on October 31, 2004, pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (expedited removal), then on November 3, 2004, attempted to elude inspection and gain admission to the United States, and also on November 3, 2004, was paroled into the United States as a material witness for the United States Government (Exh. 1). The respondent, through counsel, admitted the charges in the NTA (Tr. at 8). The respondent sought to apply for cancellation of removal for certain non-permanent residents (Tr. at 9). The Immigration Judge denied him the opportunity to apply for that form of relief on the basis that he was barred from establishing the required good moral character and also could not establish the required 10 years of continuous physical presence (because the prior order of removal terminated his continuous physical presence).
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in relying upon his admissions at the hearing as a basis for finding that he was previously removed in 2004 and that he was subject to removal as charged in the NTA. Because the respondent was represented by counsel and his counsel conceded the charges of removability, the Immigration Judge did not err in finding him removable. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10. One of the conceded factual allegations in the NTA was that the respondent was the subject of an order of expedited removal in 2004 (Exh. 1). The respondent has never, even in his appeal brief, contested that allegation. Under Matter of Avilez, 23 I&N Dec. 799, 800 (BIA 2005), an order of expedited removal interrupts an alien’s period of continuous physical presence for purposes of his application for cancellation of removal. For that reason, the respondent is not eligible for cancellation of removal. See Tapia v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 997 (9th Cir. 2005) (“To permit an alien who was removed or left pursuant to an administrative voluntary departure to continue to accrue physical presence would thwart Congress’s clear intent that such an alien be inadmissible for years following the date of his departure.”).
 
*2 To the extent that the Immigration Judge also found the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal based upon his inability to establish good moral character, we note that the statute relied upon by the Immigration Judge (section 101(f)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)(3)) has recently been amended to make a technical correction. Under the corrected version of the statute, the respondent does not fall within the category of aliens who are barred from establishing good moral character.1
 
On appeal, the respondent makes general allegations that his counsel was ineffective. However, the respondent has not complied with any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Finally, the respondent suggests on appeal that the Board should grant him some form of humanitarian relief from removal. While we sympathize with the respondent’s situation, the Board has no authority to grant the respondent any relief beyond that for which he is statutorily eligible.
 
The appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Sandra Greene, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Steven J. Connelly,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated January 3, 2005, an Immigration Judge denied the November 1, 2004, motion to reopen that was filed by the respondents, a mother and her two minor children, seeking reopening of proceedings in which an in absentia order was entered on August 18, 2004. The respondents have appealed.
 
We first point out that the August 18, 2004, in absentia order itself did not make factual and legal findings consistent with the requirements of section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), before the in absentia order was entered. Specifically, the order does not make specific findings that proper notice was provided nor does it state that the Department of Homeland Security provided evidence establishing the respondents’ removability under the charge by clear and convincing evidence.
 
Further, the respondents’ motion to reopen, which was filed within the 90-day period that generally applies to motions to reopen, makes an argument that reopening is warranted under Matter of M-S-, 22 l&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998), in which we held that the formal rescission requirements need not be satisfied where the respondent has not been orally advised, in a language that he or she understands, of the consequences for failing to appear, and is now eligible for relief that was unavailable at the time of the in absentia hearing. We find that the Immigration Judge failed to adequately address whether reopening under Matter of M-S-, supra, is warranted.
 
The Notice to Appear indicates that the warnings regarding the consequences for failing to appear were provided in the English language. The motion specifically asserts that the respondents do not understand English. The Immigration Judge’s finding to the contrary is conclusory. There is no specific statement on the Form I-213 indicating that the respondents directly communicated with the immigration officials in English. The respondents argue that communications with immigration officers were facilitated by the children’s father, who does speak some English. Further, we recognize, as should the Immigration Judge, that it is common for unrepresented aliens who do not speak English to submit letters and other statements that have been prepared in the English language with the assistance of friends and relatives. The submission of such a letter is not contrary to their assertion that English is not a language that they understand. The filing of a motion in the English language is also not evidence of English proficiency. As discussed below, the motion was not prepared by the respondents.
 
*2 Finally, the respondents argue on appeal that they were ineffectively assisted by counsel. They have provided a copy of their retainer agreement requiring them to pay $4,000 for attorneys to prepare a motion on their behalf, with the proviso that it be filed pro se, without identifying the attorneys as its author. The respondents request an opportunity to perfect a claim under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondents shall be provided a reasonable time within which to present a proper ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the remanded proceedings.
 
The respondents have provided documents showing that the two minor respondents are the beneficiaries of approved visa petitions. Further, the adult respondent is the beneficiary of a pending visa petition that was filed by her United States citizen father. We note that the adult respondent, in the supplement to the motion, also provided documentation that she is married to a United States citizen.
 
Accordingly, we will remand the record for a new decision, with appropriate fact finding and legal analysis, which addresses the respondents’ claims that reopening is warranted under Matter of M-S-, supra, and/or Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

File: A97 539 578 - Atlanta

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rachel Effron, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has timely filed a motion asking this Board to reconsider our May 2, 2006, decision dismissing the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision issued on November 18, 2005. The motion for reconsideration will be granted and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
 
In dismissing the respondent’s appeal on May 2, 2006, we noted that the respondentt failed to establish prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal because the application was not complete. Upon reconsideration, we find that the respondent presented an application which was sufficient to establish prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal.1 While we also noted in our decision that the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent failed to comply with this Board’s framework for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we did not fully address that issue. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion for reconsideration is granted so that this Board may fully address the merits of the respondent’s appeal.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s initial motion because the respondent failed to fully comply with this Board’s framework for proving a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, namely, because the respondent did not submit evidence that she had filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary, authorities. Following the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion because the respondent failed to notify the appropriate disciplinary authorities, the respondent filed a motion for reconsideration that included evidence that she had filed a formal complaint with the State Bar.
 
We have held that to satisfy a claim based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must support her claim by a detailed affidavit, inform her previous attorney of the allegations of misconduct and provide the attorney with an opportunity to respond, and state whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to the attorney’s alleged violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not (emphasis added). Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Based on the totality of the circumstances, the respondent’s appeal is sustained. The record reveals that the respondent provided a reasonable explanation for not filing a formal complaint, which complies with this Board’s Lozada framework. Moreover, when her motion to reopen was denied for lack of a formal complaint, the respondent exercised due diligence in filing a formal complaint with the State Bar and included evidence that she had filed a complaint with her motion to reconsider. In sum, we find that the respondent sufficiently complied with the framework of Lozada, supra, in showing that she was afforded ineffective assistance of counsel.
*2 ORDER: The motion for reconsideration is granted. This Board’s decision dated May 5, 2006, is vacated.
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated November 18, 2005, is sustained. Proceedings are ordered reopened and remanded to the Immigration Judge for a merits hearing on the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal.

ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM: The respondent was ordered removed by an Immigration Judge in a decision dated March 28, 2001. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion to reopen in a decision dated October 3, 2001. Both the Immigration Judge and the Board found that the respondent had not derived United States citizenship from his father. On August 13, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen through which he again asserted that he had derived United States citizenship from his father and alleged new evidence obtained by an attorney to support his claim. The Board denied the motion on September 10, 2004, as untimely filed. On April. 17, 2006, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen through which he again asserts that he had derived United States citizenship from his father and again alleges evidence obtained by an attorney to support his claim. The respondent also filed a motion to stay removal which was denied by the Board on May 2, 2006. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed no response to the motion. The motion to reopen is denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is denied for separate and independent reasons. First, the motion is untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s October 3, 2001, decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Second, the motion is number-barred because it exceeds the numerical limitations on motions to reopen. Id. Third, the motion is unaccompanied by the alleged “new” evidence from attorney Stacy Caplow as required by regulation: Id.
 
Fourth to the extent that the respondent is alleging that his former attorney, Bonnie Mazur, Esquire, provided ineffective assistance by not presenting the alleged new evidence, the motion does not comply with any of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Asaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553(BIA 2003).
 
*2 Fifth, the alleged new evidence, should it exist as stated in the respondent’s motion does not support a finding that the respondent received ineffective assistance from Ms. Mazur or that he derived United States citizenship from his father. The respondent contends that Ms. Caplow discovered that in his parent’s divorce decree, the judge found that the respondent’s mother had abandoned the family 3 years prior to the divorce, when the respondent was 16 years of age. He also asserts that his mother executed an affidavit in which she admitted that she abandoned the family on January 15, 1988, and explained her reasons for doing so. These facts do not show that the respondent’s parents were legally separated prior to their divorce or that the respondent’s father had legal custody of the respondent prior to the respondent’s 18th birthday.2 Thus, these facts do not support a finding that the respondent received ineffective assistance from Ms. Mazur since these facts, even if brought out at the respondent’s hearing before the Immigration Judge, does not establish that he derived United States citizenship from his father prior to his 18th birthday. Therefore, the motion to reopen is denied.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se1
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Catherine E. Halliday-Roberts
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent is a male native and citizen of El Salvador who was placed in removal proceedings through the filing of a Notice to Appear with the Los Angeles Immigration Court on June 30, 2004. An Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia on April 4, 2005, after the respondent failed to appear at his scheduled hearing. On April 25, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reopen seeking to rescind the in absentia order. The Immigration Judge denied the motion in a written decision dated June 21, 2005. The respondent filed a timely appeal of that decision. In an order dated October 4, 2005, the Board summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision. On May 8, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to reopen through which he seeks reopening of proceedings based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his former counsel, Early M. Hawkins, Esquire. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a response in opposition based solely upon the argument that the respondent’s motion is number-barred because the respondent had previously filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. The motion to reopen will be granted.
 
The respondent has not fully complied with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Although he has provided a translated copy of his legal agreement with Mr. Hawkins and a copy of his complaint to the California state bar, he has not provided evidence showing that he informed Mr. Hawkins of the complaint in order to allow his former attorney an opportunity to respond. The respondent’s letter to former counsel requesting a copy of his file is not a substitute for informing counsel of the specifics of the respondent’s allegations. Likewise, the submission of a complaint to the appropriate state bar disciplinary authorities is insufficient because in such situations, any response from former counsel will be made to the state bar and not to the Board for our consideration in an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We expect an alien alleging that he or she has received ineffective assistance of counsel from a prior attorney to inform the attorney of the allegations of ineffectiveness so that the attorney has the opportunity to rebut or explain the allegations. However, the respondent has substantially complied with the Lozada requirements, which is all that is required for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in which jurisdiction the present case arises. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 824-25 (9th Cir. 2003); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 We must now determine whether the respondent’s motion is timely filed and, if not, is subject to equitable tolling. The respondent’s motion is untimely filed because it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s October 4, 2005, decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The motion was filed on May 6, 2006, just over 7 months after the Board rendered its decision. However, under the jurisprudence of the Ninth Circuit equitable tolling of the time limits for motions to reopen is available to aliens who have filed with the Board otherwise untimely motions in which they raise allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001). See also Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002), and cases cited therein. We find that the respondent has shown that he exercised due diligence as his motion was filed approximately 6 weeks after he was detained by the DHS and learned, upon discussions with his present attorney, of the facts and circumstances of his case.
 
We therefore next examine the merits of the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The Ninth Circuit has stated that such inquiry must begin with determining whether competent counsel would have acted otherwise before examining whether an alien was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective actions of counsel. See Maravilla-Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004). We find that competent counsel would have acted otherwise. The respondent’s detailed affidavit and supporting documentation, including payment receipts and a copy of the his legal representation contract, establish that Mr. Hawkins provided ineffective assistance. The respondent has shown that virtually all of his legal business, including the preparation of forms and legal documents, with Mr. Hawkins’ firm was conducted through, and by, Mr. Hawkins’ office manager, Jose Coronado Vigil, who is not an attorney. The respondent has shown that his contact with Mr. Hawkins was limited to a handful of occasions during which periods of time no substantive discussions of the respondent’s case took place. The respondent has shown that as a result of Mr. Coronado Vigil’s actions, he failed to appear at his hearing due to inaccurate information received from Mr. Coronado-Vigil. These are not the actions or oversight expected of, or provided by, competent counsel.
 
In examining whether the respondent was prejudiced by counsel’s actions, we must determine whether the outcome of the respondents’ case may have been affected. See Maravilla-Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d at 859. We find that it was. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia because Mr. Hawkins’ office manager informed the respondent, incorrectly, that his Immigration Court hearing date had been changed. Moreover, although the respondent indicates in paragraph 11, page 5 of his affidavit that he did not want asylum (Resp. Mot. at Exh. J), the respondent was deprived of an opportunity to proceed on, or withdraw, his asylum application, establish whether he was eligible for relief from removal, or qualify for the privilege of voluntary departure. Thus, the respondent was prejudiced as a result of Mr. Hawkins’ actions. We therefore find that the reopening of proceedings is warranted in this case because the respondent has met his burden of establishing that he received ineffective assistance from his prior attorney and that such ineffectiveness resulted in prejudice to him.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed on his behalf by Rosemary J. Esparza, Esquire. However, Ms. Esparza filed a Notice of Appearance as Attorney before the Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28) rather than the correct Notice of Appearance as Attorney before the Board of Immigration Appeals (Form EOIR-27). Submissions before the Board by an attorney must be accompanied by a completed Form EOIR-27 as required by long-standing regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1292.4 and the Board’s Practice Manual (first issued December 1999). Therefore, for purposes of this decision, the respondent will be considered pro se. A courtesy copy of the Board’s decision will be sent to Ms. Esparza.

File: AXX XX0 123 - Bradenton
May 31, 2006
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on April 28, 2006, when we denied the respondent’s motion for a stay of removal. The respondent has also filed a motion to reopen, which will be denied.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent maintains that he received ineffective assistance of counsel as a result of his former attorney’s failure to timely appeal an Immigration Judge’s August 5, 2005, decision finding him ineligible for relief under former Section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639, we held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the claim reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not.
 
The Board has held that satisfying the above procedural requirements is in and of itself an insufficient reason to reopen, and that an attorney’s failure to file an appeal on behalf of an alien is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). It is also required that the respondent establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his prior attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Id. This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id.
 
In the instant case, the respondent submitted an affidavit setting forth his agreement with his former counsel, and attached a copy of the complaint he filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. While the respondent also submitted a copy of a letter sent to his former attorney advising him that he was in the process of filing a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, he failed to notify his prior counsel of the specific allegations leveled against him. Further, the respondent has failed to establish that he suffered any prejudice due to his former counsel’s actions. See Matter of Assaad, supra; see also Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). The respondent was represented by his former counsel before the Immigration Judge, and was provided an opportunity to present his claim for section 212(c) relief as provided in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44. Following a review of the evidence, in this case, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was statutorily ineligible for section 212(c) relief to waive his February 1990 drug trafficking conviction, because he illegally returned to the United States following a final order of deportation on July 1, 1996. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(k)(2). Nothing presented within the respondent’s motion to reopen or attachments convinces us that he would likely have prevailed on appeal of that determination. Based upon this lack of proof, we are unable to find that the respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements for proving that he was ineffectively represented or was prejudiced by his former attorney in these proceedings. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Tracy J. Cody
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION:. Termination
 
On January 30, 2006, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. The respondent has appealed from this decision. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). The respondent’s fee waiver request is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(c).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of the Philippines. He entered the United States as an immigrant on September 13, 1986. On November 22, 1997, he was convicted of petty theft with a prior under Cal. Penal Code § 484. He later violated his probation and, on November 19, 2001, he was sentenced to 365 days in prison. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s offense made him removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. The respondent has appealed from this decision.
 
On appeal, the respondent raises numerous arguments. He has challenged his removability, raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and argued that both the Department of Homeland Security (the DHS) and the Immigration Judge violated his right to due process. The respondent’s arguments on these issues are without merit.
 
First, the respondent does qualify as an arriving alien subject to removal under section 212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a), despite his claims. When the respondent attempted to return to the United States at the Los Angeles International Airport on September 30, 2004, he was a returning resident, but he had committed an offense identified in section 212(a)(2) of the Act and had not been granted a waiver for that crime. He therefore fell within section 101(a)(13)(C)(v) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), and is considered an alien seeking admission.
 
The respondent maintains that his crime of petty theft does not make him removable or subject to removal under section 212(a)(2) of the Act, but we must disagree. The crime of petty theft is a crime involving moral turpitude, and the respondent’s offense does not fit within the petty offense exception because it is not the respondent’s only conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude. See sections 212(a)(2)(A)(i) and 212(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act (indicating that the crime involving moral turpitude provision does not apply to an alien who has committed only one crime). The record shows that the respondent has been convicted of petty theft on at least one other occasion. Accordingly, the respondent’s 1997 conviction for petty theft makes him removable as charged. We therefore uphold the Immigration Judge’s finding of removability.
 
*2 In addition, we see no evidence that the DHS or the Immigration Judge violated the respondent’s due process rights. The DHS had a proper basis for placing the respondent in proceedings and for detaining him upon his arrival.
 
Finally, the respondent has not provided any detail regarding his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has not explained why his former attorney’s performance was ineffective, and he has not attempted to meet the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). We therefore cannot conclude that the respondent is entitled to a new hearing on the basis of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
On the other hand, we do find that a remand is necessary to allow the respondent to pursue cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act. The Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for this form of relief because the Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s conviction for petty theft was a conviction for an aggravated felony. The respondent’s offense, however, does not qualify as an aggravated felony under the law of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See United States v. Corona-Sanchez, 291 F.3d 1201 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
The offense of petty theft has a maximum possible sentence of 6 months, a sentence that is too short to make the offense an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act. We may not look to the recidivist enhancement the respondent received in determining whether his crime meets the sentence requirement of section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act. See United States v. Corona Sanchez, supra, at 1210-11.
 
Based on the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the respondent has been convicted of an aggravated felony or that he is statutorily barred from obtaining cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act. We therefore remand his case to the Immigration Judge to allow the respondent to pursue this form of relief.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
MIRANDA, Victoria
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Arthur S. Raznick,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated February 27, 2006. In her motion, the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Service (“DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the respondent’s motion arguing that the respondent failed to meet the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
To satisfy a claim based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must support her claim by a detailed affidavit, inform her previous attorney of the allegations of misconduct and provide the attorney with an opportunity to respond, state whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to the attorney’s alleged violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, if not, why not, and demonstrate that she suffered prejudice. Matter of Lozada, supra; Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997); Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). Here, the respondent failed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, as the respondent did support her claim with a detailed affidavit, file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, or inform her former counsel of the allegations against him. We do not find that the instant case presents a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel in which the Lozada requirements need not be strictly applied. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002). Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied. The respondent’s motion to stay removal is also denied.
