IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eva Kozlowska, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent was ordered removed in absentia by an Immigration Judge on May 26, 2011. His first motion to reopen that order was denied by an Immigration Judge on October 13, 2011, and on January 26, 2012, the Board found that the appeal of that decision was untimely filed. The respondent then filed a second motion to reopen which was also denied by an Immigration Judge, and the Board dismissed the appeal of that decision on March 29, 2013. On June 25, 2013, the respondent submitted the instant motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The record will be remanded.
 
An alien who seeks to reopen removal proceedings following the entry of an in absentia removal order must demonstrate that the alien’s failure to appear was due to “exceptional circumstances.” Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). Ineffective assistance of counsel may be an exceptional circumstance only if the alien shows prejudice. Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2005). A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may amount to exceptional circumstances “when an applicant’s failure to appear is due to his attorney’s errant instruction.” Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir. 2008) (concluding the respondent showed prejudice as his attorney told him he did not need to appear at hearing and that venue had been changed); see also Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472, 473-74 (BIA 1996) (a respondent showed prejudice where he was incorrectly informed by his attorney’s staff that there had been a continuance and he did not need to appear at the hearing).
 
The respondent contends that former counsel, Ms. Goldenberg, provided ineffective assistance by not telling him that his motion to change venue was denied or that he had to appear at his scheduled hearing, and as counsel did not appear at the hearing herself, or make alternative arrangements for his representation. The respondent further notes that counsel filed a facially defective motion to change venue, an untimely appeal before the Board, and an untimely motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge. While the record reflects that the noted submissions were filed pro se, Ms. Goldenberg has not responded to the allegations that she, in fact, was responsible for filing them.
 
The respondent has submitted evidence reflecting compliance with the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (Motion, Tabs C, I, J). Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005). Moreover, as counsel’s errors prevented him from presenting his case, she caused him prejudicial harm. In light of this record, we find it appropriate to grant the respondent’s motion to reopen, vacate the prior decisions, and remand the record for further proceedings. Accordingly, the following orders shall be issued.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decisions dated January 26, 2012, and March 29, 2013, and the Immigration Judge’s decisions dated May 26, 2011, November 14, 2011, and March 29, 2012, are hereby vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and for the entry of a new decision.

IN RE: ADAN PRIETO-CORTEZ
File: AXXX XX4 565 - Los Angeles, CA
September 23, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph J. Huprich, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 15, 2012, decision denying his untimely motion to reopen based on his claim of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent does not dispute that his motion to reopen was untimely filed (I.J. at 2). Rather, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in finding he did not meet his burden in establishing he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel when his former counsel conceded removability as charged, did not file a motion to withdraw the pleadings, and did not file an application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). In this regard, the Immigration Judge concluded the respondent did not establish the doctrine of equitable tolling applied in his case because he did not provide any information as to when he became aware of the alleged deficient representation to show due diligence in filing the motion and did not comply at all with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), to establish ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 2-4). See Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2007) (equitable tolling requirements); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002) (requirements to succeed on ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge issued her decision denying the motion “prematurely” because current counsel had not obtained the transcript of the proceedings despite his request to the Immigration Court and that prior counsel’s ineffective assistance should have been evident to the Immigration Judge just from a review of the record. Notwithstanding the respondent’s contentions on appeal, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen for the reasons stated in his decision (I.J. at 2-4). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2013) (de novo review).
 
In support of his contention that the Immigration Judge acted prematurely in rendering her decision on the motion, the respondent relies on Dent v. Holder, 627 F.3d 365 (9th Cir. 2010), and argues that the Immigration Judge should have waited until after counsel listened to the tapes of the prior proceedings before making his decision. However, we point out the decision in Dent dealt with the statutory mandate that an alien in removal proceedings be given access to his entry documents and any other records and documents, not considered by the Attorney General to be confidential, pertaining to his admission or presence in the United States. See id. at 374. It does not pertain to counsel’s ability to listen to tapes prior to filing a motion to reopen. We are unpersuaded by the respondent’s reliance on Dent in contending that the Immigration Judge acted prematurely in rendering her decision because counsel had not listened to the tapes of the prior proceedings.
 
*2 In addition, while the respondent has on appeal submitted an affidavit in an attempt to show he has substantially complied with Lozada, he has not complied with any of the other Lozada requirements and, notably, has not presented evidence showing that he is not removable as charged and/or that he is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, as alleged (I.J. at 3-4).1 In this regard we note that the respondent, through prior counsel, conceded his removability as charged based on an illegal entry in December 2005 (I.J. at 2). See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). The respondent claims on appeal that he was lawfully admitted to the United States with a visitor’s visa, a copy of which he provided on appeal, with an expiration date in 2011 and, as a result, former counsel should not have conceded removability and should have filed a motion to withdraw the pleadings.
 
However, the respondent has not provided evidence showing that he was lawfully admitted and states in his affidavit he told prior counsel he was lawfully admitted, was advised by prior counsel to obtain the necessary evidence, and he never did so. Thus, it appears prior counsel had a sufficient factual basis upon which to make the concessions to the facts and charges in the Notice to Appear and a sufficient basis to believe the respondent is ineligible for adjustment of status due to his illegal entry. Cf. Santiago-Rodriguez v. Holder, 657 F.3d 820 (9th Cir. 2011) (finding counsel provided ineffective assistance to alien by admitting to factual allegation without any factual basis for doing so). Under these circumstances, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Perham Makabi, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen on July 19, 2013, after we issued a final removal order on June 9, 2011. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion to reopen, to which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), has not responded, will be denied.1
 
The motion contends that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel, in that counsel did not inform him that he might seek voluntary departure (Respondent’s Mot. at 5; section 240B(b) of the Act). However, there is no statement or affidavit from the respondent concerning the claims in the motion. Statements of counsel are not evidence. See, e.g., INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980).
 
As no affidavit from the respondent is presented, the motion does not show that he acted with diligence in filing the motion two years after our final removal order. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 131 (2d Cir. 2008) (“no matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence in pursuing his claim”) (citation omitted); Wang v. Board of Immigration Appeals, 508 F.3d 710 (2d Cir. 2007)(diligence must be shown by respondent wishing to pursue an untimely motion). Moreover, the respondent does not comply with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Debeatham v. Holder, 602 F.3d 481, 484 (2d Cir. 2010). Most critically, the motion does not present “. . . an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement with former counsel concerning what action would be taken and what counsel did or did not represent in this regard.” Id. (citations omitted). The motion is, therefore, denied.

The respondent was removed to Ecuador on July 19, 2013. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held in Luna v. Holder, 637 F.3d 85 (2d Cir. 2011), that we must consider a statutory motion to reopen, even if the alien is no longer in the United States. We deny the respondent’s motion on the merits, and therefore do not reach the applicability of Luna to this case.

IN RE: SANG RAE KO

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Laurence F. Johnson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Amy S. Paulick
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(B)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(B)(i)(I)] - Nonimmigrant - no valid passport
 
Lodged: Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)] - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
 
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status
 
The respondent timely appeals from the Immigration Judge’s January 26, 2012, decision denying the respondent’s application for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“the Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her application. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) asserts that the Immigration Judge’s decision is correct and should be affirmed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen from South Korea who entered the United States on August 9, 2005. The respondent was placed in removal proceedings because DHS alleged that she was not in possession of a valid immigrant visa at the time she filed her adjustment of status application (I.J. at 2). The primary issue on appeal is summarized in the Form I-485 denial letter (DHS Group Exh. 1A) and overseas investigation (DHS Group Exh. 1B and 1C), which outline the discrepancies and concerns regarding the letter of employment the respondent submitted to support her application for adjustment of status (I.J. at 6-10).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that she would have been able to explain the discrepancies and errors if she had not received ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent, however, did not comply with the procedural requirements for filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as enunciated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741 (4th Cir. 2006) (finding no compliance with Lozada), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1182 (2007). Accordingly, that issue is not properly before us.
 
The respondent additionally offers new evidence to explain or clarify issues highlighted in the overseas investigation report and relied upon by the Immigration Judge in reaching the adverse credibility finding. We have not considered the evidence the respondent submitted to the Board. The Board is an appellate body whose function is to review, not create, a record. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984). To the extent this evidence is new, the respondent has not filed a motion to remand, and we cannot consider new evidence presented for the first time on appeal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Moreover, the respondent has not shown how this new evidence was not previously available and could not have been presented at her hearing before the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992). As previously discussed, the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim does not warrant a remand for further discussion of this evidence because she did not comply with the procedural requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, supra. Consequently, we adjudicated the appeal based upon the evidence contained in the record when it was before the Immigration Judge.
 
*2 Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Immigration Judge’s adverse credibility finding is not clearly erroneous (I.J. at 9-10). The Immigration Judge’s findings in that regard are supported by DHS’s overseas investigation, which was not rebutted by the respondent (DHS Group Exh. 1A-C). Moreover, the respondent has not presented any persuasive arguments on appeal which warrant reversing the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s adjustment of status and 212(i) waiver applications. Thus, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Samson Koyonda, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 17, 2012, denying his motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia for his failure to appear at the hearing on May 19, 2011. We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent asserts that he failed to appear at his removal hearing due to exceptional circumstances. Although the respondent’s motion is untimely, he contends that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled because he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion on the basis that equitable tolling is not permitted pursuant to controlling precedent of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (I.J. at 2). However, subsequent to the Immigration Judge’s decision, the Eleventh Circuit held that the 90-day filing deadline for a motion to reopen is subject to equitable tolling. Avila-Santoya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 188 F.3d 1273 (11th Cir. 2013) (abrogating Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273 (11th Cir. 2009)). In light of this intervening precedent, we find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the respondent’s claims regarding exceptional circumstances and ineffective assistance of counsel, and the entry of a new decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (limiting the Board’s fact-finding ability on appeal).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further consideration of the respondent’s motion to reopen.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicholas J. Mundy, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Marguerite C. Mills
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This respondent moves the Board to reconsider its June 28, 2013, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind an order of removal entered in absentia on March 16, 2006. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g). The motion will be denied.
 
In its prior order, the Board found that equitable tolling of the filing deadline imposed on motions to reopen and rescind was not warranted in this case because the respondent did not comply with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board, and he did not establish that he acted with due diligence in bringing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may qualify as an exceptional circumstance and serve to equitably toll the 180-day limitation period for filing a motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal. See Aris v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 599 (2d Cir. 2008); Iavorski v. I.N.S., 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000). To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, however, the alien must substantially comply with the procedures set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Yi Long Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133, 142-43 (2d Cir. 2007); Twum v. I.N.S., 411 F.3d 54, 59 (2d Cir. 2005). Moreover, an alien seeking equitable tolling based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must show that he exercised due diligence during the entire period he seeks to toll. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir.2008); Jian Hua Wang v. B.I.A., 508 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir. 2007).
 
In the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind, he did not offer evidence that his former attorney had been informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. Further, the motion did not reflect whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and it did not include an explanation for why a complaint had not been filed. Id. See also Garcia-Martinez v. Department of Homeland Security, 448 F.3d 511 (2d Cir. 2006). The respondent therefore did not substantially comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. Failure to comply with the Lozada requirements constitutes a forfeiture of the ineffective assistance claim. See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46 (2d Cir. 2005).
 
*2 Further, the respondent did not show that he exercised due diligence during the entire period he seeks to toll. The respondent stated that he never heard from his former attorney after he met with the attorney a few days after the March 16, 2006, court date. See Motion to Reopen and Rescind at 8. The respondent, however, did not explain what efforts he made to contact his former attorney or to ascertain the status of his case in the 7 years that elapsed between their last meeting and the filing of the motion to reopen and rescind on April 16, 2013. In sum, the Board finds no error of fact or law in our prior order to warrant reconsideration. See Matte of O-S-G-, supra.
 
With the instant motion, the respondent has submitted a supplement to his motion to reopen and rescind that is dated June 21, 2013. See Motion Exhibit E. In that document, the respondent emphasizes that his former attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel when he also failed to appear at the March 16, 2006, hearing. The respondent asserts that although he previously submitted the supplement to the Board, the Board did not consider it in its June 28, 2013, decision. See Motion to Reconsider at 4.
 
In rendering its prior order, the Board considered a supplement to the motion that was filed on May 17, 2013. The Board has no record of receiving the supplemental document, dated June 21, 2013, prior to the filing of the instant motion, and the respondent has offered no evidence of its mailing to or receipt by the Board prior to its June 28, 2013, order. Even if the Board had received the document, the argument therein would not have altered its decision because the respondent neither set forth an ineffective assistance of counsel complaint in substantial compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, nor demonstrated that he acted with due diligence in bringing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the respondent’s motion to reconsider will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

IN RE: ALFRED AJANGA AHUTA
File: AXXX XX9 217 - Haskell, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Paul Hunker
Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On July 5, 2013, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings in which the Board dismissed his appeal on January 23, 2013. The Board granted his associated request for a stay of removal on July 16, 2013. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely as it was filed more than 90 days after the Board’s decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). However, he contends that equitable tolling is appropriate as former counsel provided him with ineffective assistance. Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir. 2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). With his motion he has included an affidavit, and evidence that he informed former counsel of the allegations against him and filed a state bar complaint in this regard (Motion, Tabs J, K).
 
To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel in an immigration proceeding, the respondent must demonstrate substantial prejudice resulting from counsel’s performance. Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n. 2 (5th Cir. 2001). Proving prejudice requires that the respondent make a prima facie showing that, absent counsel’s deficient performance, he would have been entitled to the relief he sought. Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994).
 
The respondent raises several allegations of error by former counsel, including: asserting that he misrepresented to the respondent the events at his initial hearing; whether he presented an unpublished Board decision to the Immigration Judge; and counsel’s actions with respect to challenging the moral turpitude charge and the Immigration Judge’s evaluation of the same. We initially note that an Immigration Judge and this Board are not bound by either unpublished Board decisions, or by the out-of-circuit cases cited in the respondent’s motion (Motion at 11, 28-29). Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25, 31 (BIA 1989) (explaining that the Board historically follows a court’s precedent in cases arising in that circuit). Therefore, counsel’s alleged failure to ensure that an unpublished decision was presented before the Immigration Judge is not, without more, prejudicial. We also note that the decision cited by the respondent does not stand for the proposition that the respondent’s conviction is not a crime involving moral turpitude, but rather remands for the type of analysis conducted by the Board in in this case in evaluating the respondent’s appeal.
 
*2 In addition, the Board has already addressed in detail whether the Immigration Judge properly found the respondent removable as charged. In doing so, the Board acknowledged the manner in which the Immigration Judge conducted his analysis, and in turn evaluated the issue of the respondent’s removability in light of the proper analytical methodology. Thus, the respondent has not shown that he was substantially prejudiced as a result of former counsel’s alleged deficient performance.
 
As we find that the respondent has not demonstrated that his motion is subject to equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel, his motion is untimely and reopening is not warranted. Lara v. Trominski, supra. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Yaw Akuoko, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Abby L. Meyer
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Liberia, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated October 18, 2011, that denied his motion to reconsider the Immigration Judge’s prior July 27, 2011, decision that denied his motion to reopen a prior September 22, 2010, decision that granted the respondent’s application for pre-conclusion voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), (b)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the respondent’s motion to reconsider. On appeal, the respondent has submitted additional evidence to establish that his former counsel’s representation was ineffective. See Respondent’s Brief at 3-5, Exhs. A & B. We construe this evidence and argument as a motion to remand the record. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion will be denied.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge, with the following notations. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The respondent does not contest the Immigration Judge’s finding that his motion to reconsider was untimely because it was not filed within 30 days of the final administrative decision in this case (I.J. at 2; Resp. Br. at 2). See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). Therefore, we consider the issue waived. See Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 261 n.1 (BIA 2007). It follows that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider because it was time-barred. Id.
 
However, even assuming that the respondent’s motion was timely filed, we uphold the Immigration Judge’s alternative finding denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider on the merits of the claim (I.J. at 1-2). A motion to reconsider requests that the Immigration Judge reexamine his decision in light of the additional legal arguments, a change in the law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. This motion, therefore, must specify the errors of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s decision and be supported by any pertinent precedential authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The respondent’s Motion to Reconsider does not identify any material error of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s decision. He has not asserted that there has been a change of law or that an aspect of the case was overlooked. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, supra; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2). Rather, the respondent asserts that his August 30, 2011, Motion to Reconsider and his January 21, 2011, Motion to Reopen, were untimely due to errors in the fees attached to the motions and due to attorney error in ensuring that these motions were timely filed. See Motion to Reconsider, Preliminary Statement & Item 10). However, no contentions regarding ineffective assistance of counsel were explicitly raised before the Immigration Judge.1
 
*2 The only substantive argument raised in the Motion to Reconsider was that the September 2010 decision should be reopened to allow the DHS to exercise prosecutorial discretion. See Motion to Reconsider at Item 15-22. This argument is unavailing as the Immigration Judge and the Board do not have authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion, and the DHS, which has such authority, has consistently and affirmatively opposed the respondent’s attempts to reopen the September 22, 2010, decision. See DHS Opposition to Motion to Reopen (2/11/11); DHS Opposition to Motion to Reconsider (9/12/11); DHS Brief on Appeal (1/5/12).
 
The respondent also contends that the denial of the Motion to Reopen should be reconsidered on the basis that the respondent is eligible for Deferred Enforcement Departure (Temporary Protected Status) for natives and citizens of Liberia (Resp. Br. at 6). See Motion to Reconsider at Items 5-14. However, this issue does not address any error of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s October 2011 decision denying the motion to reopen due to the motion being approximately 30 days late (I.J. (7/27/11) at 1).2 Thus, the Immigration Judge properly concluded that reconsideration was not warranted because the respondent did not establish that he made any error of fact or law (I.J. at 2).
 
Furthermore, the respondent also has not met his heavy burden to establish that remand of the record for further proceedings is warranted. A motion to remand must conform to the same standard as a motion to reopen when the respondent seeks to present new evidence, but will only be granted if the new evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); Matter of Ige, 20 I&N Dec. 880, 884 (BIA 1984). In the current case, the respondent has not established that the evidence attached to the brief on appeal could not have been presented before the Immigration Judge.
 
The respondent argues that the deadline for his Motion to Reconsider should be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance of his prior counsel, Isaac O. Babalola, Esquire.3 However, he has not substantially complied with the requirements to establish an ineffective assistance claim. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir. 2003); Matter of Compean, Bangaly, J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). To establish ineffective assistance, the respondent is required to submit an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts, a statement that sets forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel, evidence that the former counsel was informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond (or a report of counsel’s failure or refusal to respond), and a complaint filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not. Id.
 
*3 The respondent has submitted an affidavit that outlines his agreement with his prior counsel on the scope of the representation that was to be provided and the nature of the alleged ineffective assistance. See Respondent’s Brief, Exh. A. He also submitted a five sentence letter to his former counsel informing him that the respondent intended to file an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s October 2011 decision on the basis of ineffective assistance as “my motion was not filed on time, and the Immigration Judge denied the motion.” See Respondent’s Brief, Exh. B.
 
The letter and affidavit provided by the respondent are insufficient to meet the requirements to establish ineffective assistance by his prior counsel. While the respondent informed his prior counsel that he was submitting an ineffective assistance claim with the Board, he did not inform the attorney of any detailed allegations associated with this claim or invite the attorney to submit a rebuttal. The respondent stated in his affidavit that he was not filing any type of disciplinary complaint against his prior attorney as this attorney explained that the late filings of the motion to reopen and reconsider where due to scheduling errors. We are at a lost to understand how this explanation would justify the respondent’s failure to pursue redress with a disciplinary authority for an admission of ethical violations, which apparently occurred with both the motion to reopen and reconsider, when such behavior if continued in the future could adversely affect other unsuspecting clients. Further, without a formal complaint to the appropriate disciplinary authority, the respondent has not presented evidence sufficient to ensure that the substance of the accusation can be properly evaluated and demonstrate that the respondent’s allegations are not meritless or baseless. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra; Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639.
 
Based on the foregoing, the respondent has not met his heavy burden to demonstrate that if the record were remanded for further proceedings it is likely that the outcome of his case would be changed. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion is denied.

The Motion to Reconsider alleges that the respondent’s Temporary Protected Status application was denied by the DHS due to a clerical error by another former counsel that prepared this document. See Motion to Reconsider at Item 5-6. However, the respondent has not presented any evidence that he has complied with the requirements to establish ineffective assistance by his former attorney.

2

In the respondent’s September 22, 2011, reply to the DHS’s opposition to the motion to reopen, the respondent argued that the Immigration Judge could reconsider the DHS denial of TPS/DED, but made no substantive arguments that these issues were the basis of any error in fact or law in denying the prior motion to reopen.

3

Neither the Motion to Reconsider nor the brief on appeal makes any substantive argument that the September 2010 decision should be reopened due to changed country conditions in Liberia. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Judith Seeds Miller, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Lodged Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)] - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 13, 2013. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for a further continuance to seek post-conviction relief. The respondent has also filed new documentation on appeal in the nature of a motion to remand. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and his motion denied.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, and review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues on appeal de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
In his brief on appeal, the respondent argues that his case requires a remand for post-conviction relief because, due to ineffective assistance of counsel, he did not understand the immigration consequences of his guilty plea (Respondent’s Br. at 2; Notice of Appeal at 2; Respondent’s Exhs. A-E). The United States Supreme Court has held that a criminal lawyer representing a non-citizen in connection with a guilty plea has a constitutional duty to advise the defendant that conviction may pose a risk of deportation. Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010). However, a potential collateral attack on a conviction does not impair the validity of an alien’s conviction for immigration purposes unless and until the conviction is overturned. E.g., Montilla v. INS, 926 F.2d 162, 164 (2d Cir. 1991); Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996).
 
After continuing the respondent’s case several times for him to seek post-conviction relief for his aggravated felony theft offense, the Immigration Judge ultimately concluded that the delay was becoming unreasonable particularly in light of the fact that the respondent did not appear to be pursuing this relief in a prompt and diligent fashion (I.J. at 2; Tr. 1-19).
 
The respondent has submitted new documentation on appeal including interim orders and other correspondence for his pending habeas corpus petition (Respondent’s Exhs. A-E). Cf. Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). However, the record reflects that his initial request for an immediate ruling on his petition has been denied, additional evidence is being sought, and that the proceeding remains unresolved (Respondent’s Exhs. at A, C and D). Although the respondent’s petition for habeas corpus appears to be moving through the state’s court system, we have received no indication that the respondent’s conviction has been vacated or materially modified in any way (Respondent’s Exhs. A-E).
 
*2 While a collateral criminal proceeding challenging his conviction is pending, the case remains in the same posture as the day the Immigration Judge determined that there was no good cause for further continuances in the respondent’s case. See Cabral v. Holder, 632 F.3d 886, 890 (5th Cir. 2011) (holding that the Board is not required to hold removal proceedings in abeyance pending motions for post-conviction relief in state court). As noted above, a collateral attack does not impair the validity of an alien’s conviction. E.g., Montilla v. INS, supra; Matter of Madrigal, supra. While there may be some truly exceptional cases in which an Immigration Judge might justifiably grant a continuance during the pendency of a criminal matter, the respondent does not have a due process right to such a continuance. See United States v. Gonzalez-Valerio, 342 F.3d 1051, 1053 (9th Cir. 2003). Under the circumstances, we have no basis for concluding that the respondent suffered any violation of his due process of law. As such, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate good cause for a continuance in his case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ismael Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, filed an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated August 9, 2012, that denied her motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) did not file a brief. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i)-(ii).
 
The record indicates the respondent was ordered removed in absentia on January 16, 2002. On June 1, 2012, the respondent’s attorney filed a motion with the Immigration Judge, requesting that her proceedings be reopened to allow her to adjust status based on a visa petition application filed by her husband, who recently naturalized as a citizen of the United States. She alleges the Motion to Reopen was filed as soon as she was aware of her removal order; however, she also stated that in 2007 she retained another attorney who advised her of the removal order (Respondent’s Br. at 2-3). The respondent argues lack of notice as her reason for not attending the immigration hearing.
 
The Immigration Judge determined, based on the respondent’s representation in the motion, that she did not notify the Court of her new address after venue was changed to New York, New York (I.J. at 3).1 As such, she did not establish that proper notice of the hearing was not provided using her last address. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4); see Bhanot v. Chertoff, 474 F.3d 71, 73 (2d Cir. 2007) (holding that when the government sent notice of petitioner’s changed hearing date to his most recent address, a presumption of receipt applied); see also Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27, 38 (BIA 1995).
 
The notice of hearing provisions are satisfied when notice is sent to the last address provided by the respondent. Bhanot v. Chertoff, supra. In this case, the respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear containing the address warnings, and the Immigration Court mailed the hearing notice to the last address provided by the respondent to the DHS (I.J. at 2).
 
Additionally, the respondent became aware of her removal order in 2007 (I.J. at 2). The respondent did not comply with the procedural steps for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against the attorney she alleges to have retained at that time (I.J. at 3). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.25(b)(4)(ii); see Debeatham v. Holder, 602 F.3d 481, 484-85 (2d Cir. 2010) (finding that where a motion to reopen is based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988)). In light of the foregoing, we agree with the Immigration Judge that she did not establish an ineffective assistance claim on which to base an equitable tolling claim to excuse the untimeliness of the motion. Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely filed. She has not demonstrated that she qualifies for any of the exceptions to the deadlines for filing motions to reopen under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4) or that the deadline should be equitably tolled.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent submitted additional evidence concerning her son’s educational and mental health issues. Although we are sympathetic, we do not consider evidence first submitted on appeal. Further, we do not find that this evidence, when considered with the prior motion, provides a sufficient basis to warrant invoking sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) (providing the Board may reopen, sua sponte, cases where it has rendered a prior decision); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
Although the respondent requests voluntary departure, the circumstances here do not warrant reopening to allow her an opportunity to pursue this relief 10 years after the entry of a final removal order (Respondent’s Br. at 5).
 
The respondent may pursue a request for prosecutorial discretion with the DHS, as neither the Immigration Judge, nor this Board, has authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion in this case. See generally Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 349-50 (BIA 1982).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Troy D. Harris, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michele Drucker
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Remand; adjustment of status; voluntary departure
 
This is the second time this case is before us. The respondent is a native and citizen of Brazil. The case originally was before us pursuant to a Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) appeal of an April 5, 2011, decision granting the respondent’s adjustment of status application.1 On June 14, 2012, we sustained DHS’s appeal and concluded that the respondent’s former husband was no longer a derivative grandfathered alien and was not eligible to adjust his status in that manner. We remanded the record solely in order for the Immigration Judge to determine eligibility for voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge found the respondent eligible for voluntary departure and granted her that form of relief on August 14, 2012. The Immigration Judge denied respondent’s request for a continuance in order to await the adjudication of an I-130 visa petition filed on her behalf on August 1, 2012, by her second husband, whom she married in March 2012. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal and deny her motion to remand.
 
In her Notice of Appeal, the respondent contends that her former counsel mistakenly concluded a grant of voluntary departure would not have any detrimental effect in Consular processing. The respondent does not appeal the denial of her request for a continuance and we consider that issue abandoned. Matter of Cervantes, 22 I&N Dec. 560, 561 n.1 (BIA 1999). Instead, the respondent asks us to remand the record pending the adjudication of the I-130 visa petition filed on her behalf by her second husband. She includes several documents in support of the bona fides of her marriage.
 
It appears that the respondent is making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim with regard to her former counsel’s assertion below that a grant of voluntary departure would not affect Consular processing of her instant visa petition. An ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be supported by (1) an affidavit from the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel regarding the litigation matters the attorney was retained to address, (2) documentary evidence that the counsel in question was informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond, and (3) proof that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to the alleged ineffective assistance (and if this is not filed, why it was not). Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). This respondent has not complied with any of the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, and we will deny her claim.
 
*2 The respondent also asks that we remand the proceedings so she can await the adjudication of her instant pending I-130 visa petition. The Board long has held that a motion to remand must meet the same standards as a motion to reopen. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-72 (BIA 1992). Specifically, the Board may deny a motion to remand where a respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for the relief sought or where the evidence to be submitted in support of the motion was not previously unavailable or material to the relief requested. Id. at 472. Further, the party moving to remand bears a “heavy burden” of proving that the new evidence would change the result in the case if it were remanded. Id. Finally, the Board may deny such a motion where the ultimate relief sought is discretionary and we would not grant the relief as a matter of discretion. Id.
 
The respondent was married while in proceedings and must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that her marriage is bona fide. Sections 204(g) and 245(e)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1154(g) and 1255. The respondent does submit some documentation in support of her motion to remand. However, we conclude that the evidence is not sufficient to meet the heavy burden of prima facie eligibility in this instance. Further, the respondent does not have an approved visa petition and has not provided an indication of when the visa petition might be adjudicated. Thus, it is not evident that the outcome of the respondent’s case would change and we will deny the respondent’s motion to remand. Finally, the record does not contain evidence that the respondent paid her voluntary departure bond and we will not reinstate voluntary departure on appeal.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be issued:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed and her motion to remand is denied.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The final order of removal in these proceedings was entered by the Board on October 21, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen his proceedings on May 29, 2013. See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent does not dispute the untimeliness of his motion, but requests that the Board exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen his proceedings in the interests of justice. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent has submitted evidence that a state court has vacated his conviction for attempted assault in the second degree in violation of New York Penal Law section 110-120.05-02 and allowed him to plead guilty to menacing in the third degree in violation of New York Penal Law section 120.15. See generally Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003); Matter of Chavez, 24 I&N Dec. 272 (BIA 2007). The record contains the New York state court’s order finding evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel related to the respondent’s guilty plea and ordering a Padilla hearing (Motion, Tab D). The record also contains the hearing transcript for the withdrawal and amended pleas (Motion, Tabs E, F).
 
Considering the entirety of circumstances presented, we will reopen the proceedings on our own motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We do not express an opinion on the merits of the respondent’s entitlement to relief. On remand, the Immigration Judge may receive any additional evidence he deems appropriate to the full resolution of this matter, including additional or substituted charges of deportability, if any. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.30 and 1240.10(e). Accordingly, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the respondent’s deportability in light of the evidence of the vacated plea and amended conviction, and for further consideration of the respondent’s eligibility for relief from deportation.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Loide Rosa Jorge, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carrie E. Johnston
Senior Attorney
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 13, 2013. We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment arising in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo, whereas we review findings of fact in such appeals under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under our de novo review, we conclude that the respondent did not show good cause warranting a further continuance to allow him another opportunity to seek post-conviction relief with the hope of having criminal convictions vacated. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. “[C]ollateral attacks upon the respondent’s conviction do not operate to negate the finality of his conviction unless and until the conviction is overturned.” Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The respondent’s prior attempt to seek post-conviction relief did not succeed, and the future likelihood of the respondent’s success in having his convictions vacated was and is unknown.1
 
The respondent has asserted that prior counsel provided ineffective assistance in the effort to seek post-conviction relief. We do not find that remand is warranted. First, the respondent’s assertion of ineffective assistance in his criminal matters is not a basis for remand in immigration proceedings. Second, the respondent has not shown substantial compliance with the procedures set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Matter of Lozada, we stated that a motion asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement between the respondent and his legal representative and what actions were to be taken on his behalf, (2) that the counsel whose reputation is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) an indication of whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. Most importantly, there is no evidence that prior counsel has been informed of the allegations against him and been given an opportunity to respond. Counsel’s assertion that the respondent’s fiancée has made efforts in that regard is not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980). Nor has the respondent provided evidence as to whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eric Avazian, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Bradley A. Sherman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of September 18, 2012. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on September 26, 2011. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not established that proceedings should be reopened. There is no issue regarding whether the respondent knew that he had a scheduled removal hearing. Thus, the respondent had notice of his hearing and can seek reopening of proceedings solely upon the basis of exceptional circumstances. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). In this case, the respondent claims that he failed to appear because he mistakenly relied on the advice of a paralegal, Ms. Basmajian, who told the respondent not to appear at his hearing.1 However, the respondent does not claim that Ms. Basmajian held herself out to be an attorney; nor does the respondent claim that he believed Ms. Basmajian was an attorney. We therefore find that the respondent has not established exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. See Galvez-Vergara v. Gonzalez, 484 F.3d 798 (5th Cir. 2007)(finding that reasonable reliance on counsel’s erroneous advice can constitute “exceptional circumstances” requiring rescission of an order of removal).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues for equitable tolling, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case lies, has not issued a published opinion squarely adopting the doctrine of equitable tolling in the context of a motion to reopen immigration proceedings, and so the respondent’s citation to and reliance upon Second and Third Circuit cases is unavailing here.
 
Nevertheless, even if we assume without deciding that such tolling could be available to the respondent, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by delaying nearly one year in raising the issue. See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n. 2 (5th Cir. 2001). Equitable tolling depends upon the particular facts and circumstances of each case, and the doctrine should be employed only in “rare and exceptional circumstances.” United States v. English, 400 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir. 2005) (involving criminal proceedings).
 
*2 Here, the respondent does not specify when he discovered the basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, but there is no indication he did not receive the September 26, 2011, in absentia order. At that time, he had reason to inquire, yet he apparently did nothing until he filed the August 2, 2012, motion to reopen. Consequently, the respondent has failed to establish due diligence in order to avail himself of equitable tolling.
 
We find that the respondent has not established an exceptional circumstance herein to warrant the sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We also observe that while the respondent alleges that Ms. Basmajian advised the respondent not to appear at his hearing, no such admission is included in Ms. Basmajian’s affidavit.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Justin Egeolu, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 18, 2012. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent was afforded proper notice of her hearing by the Immigration Court, inasmuch as written notice of the hearing was provided to the respondent’s counsel of record. Notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
Furthermore, the respondent has not set forth a claim of deficient performance of counsel in accordance with the procedural requirements of our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We disagree with the respondent’s appellate contention that she need not comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. Contrary to the respondent’s argument on appeal, the record does not clearly indicate that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, even if the record had clearly indicated that she received ineffective assistance from her former counsel, it would not excuse the respondent from substantial compliance with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. See Barry v. Gonzalez, 445 F.3d 741, 746-7 (4th Cir. 2006) (requiring “substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements). In support of the respondent’s contention that she need not comply with Matter of Lozada, supra, the respondent cites to Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582 (9th Cir. 2006) and Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893 (9th Cir. 2008); however, we are not bound by these decisions, inasmuch as they were not issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this matter arises. Although the respondent in this matter submitted a sworn statement setting forth her version of the facts in this matter, the respondent did not submit evidence that she informed former counsel of her allegations of ineffective assistance or file a disciplinary complaint with the appropriate authorities in accordance with Matter of Lozada, supra.1 In light of the foregoing, we find that the respondent has not met her burden of proof to demonstrate that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent has submitted evidence on appeal that a letter informing her former counsel of the allegations against him was drafted by her current counsel; however, the respondent has not submitted any evidence that the letter was actually mailed. Furthermore, this Board does not consider evidence first offered on appeal. See Matter of Soriano, 19 I&N Dec. 764 (BIA 1988).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard Mendez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathon Foerstel
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 On October 5, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted the government’s unopposed motion to remand the record to this Board. The case had previously been before us on November 14, 2011, at which time we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings. Upon remand, both parties have submitted supplemental briefing.
 
In our November 14, 2011, decision, we found that the respondent had not submitted sufficient evidence to support his claim that he was prejudiced by his prior attorney’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel (Bd. Dec. at 1). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Specifically, we found that the while the respondent argued that his prior attorney erred in not pursuing adjustment of status, his motion did not contain an application for adjustment of status, nor did it contain other evidence that he is currently eligible for such relief (Bd. Dec. at 1). In its motion to remand before the Ninth Circuit, the government noted that the respondent, in his motion, also alleged that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to pursue an application for withholding of removal from Guatemala. The government further noted that our previous analysis regarding prejudice was too restrictive, and that the respondent needed only to demonstrate that his previous counsel’s ineffective assistance may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 646 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004).
 
Given the totality of the circumstances, we will vacate our November 14, 2011, decision and remand the record to the Immigration Court to further assess the respondent’s eligibility for relief from removal. The respondent has submitted evidence in substantial compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, and his motion was filed with due diligence. See Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Iturribarria v. INS, supra. Moreover, the respondent’s prior attorney indicated that the respondent wanted to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture at his hearing on March 10, 2011 (Tr. at 7), but no applications were ever presented in court. While we might disagree that the respondent’s prior attorney had a duty to tell the respondent to marry his girlfriend, the fact remains that the respondent may now be eligible for adjustment of status in conjunction with a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(h) of the Act. Given these circumstances, we find that the respondent’s prior attorney’s actions may have affected the outcome of his proceedings. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra. As such, we will remand the record to the Immigration Court for further proceedings regarding the respondent’s requests for relief from removal.
 
*2 ORDER: The Board’s November 14, 2011, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: URIAH SMALL
File: AXXX XX5 011 - New York, NY
July 30, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pearline Blackwood, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 9, 2012, denying his motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on December 20, 2002. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in concluding that he did not exercise due diligence in seeking to reopen the proceedings. The respondent has submitted additional evidence on appeal, but has provided no persuasive explanation why such evidence was not previously available to him. The Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995).
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear was issued on June 20, 2000, and served on the respondent by regular mail on that date. During the proceedings on October 4, 2002, the respondent was given oral and written notice of his next hearing scheduled for December 20, 2002, and he was advised of the consequences of a failure to appear. The respondent’s former attorney, James Elliot Howard, Esquire, filed a motion to continue on December 19, 2002. The respondent did not appear for the hearing on December 20, 2002, and the Immigration Judge issued an in absentia order of removal.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent received notice of the hearing scheduled for December 20, 2002. Therefore, the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed untimely whether the respondent is seeking reopening under the rescission provisions pertaining to in absentia orders of removal, or the general motions to reopen provisions. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(4)(ii), 8 C.F.R. 1003.23(b)(1).
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the alien has satisfied the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has determined that the deadline for motions to reopen deportation proceedings may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 130 (2d Cir. 2000). However, in order to equitably toll the filing deadline for a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate that he has exercised due diligence during the entire period he seeks to toll. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008). This includes both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed. Id.; see also Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006) (court concluded that aliens had demonstrated that their counsel was ineffective in informing them that they did not need to appear at a hearing, but they had not met their burden of showing why they had not been diligent over a two-year period).
 
The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent has not demonstrated that he is entitled to equitable tolling, as he has not established that he acted with due diligence in this matter. The respondent states on appeal that Mr. Howard failed to properly file the correct documents in his divorce proceedings and that the divorce was ultimately denied, which is reflected in a document from the Supreme Court of the State of New York, dated March 14, 2003. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Exh. 10. The respondent indicates on appeal that he is unable to recall the exact year that Mr. Howard finally told him his immigration case was closed, but he did not know what being “closed” meant, and he contends that Mr. Howard did not advise the respondent that he had been ordered removed from the United States. However, the respondent has not met his burden of showing that he had been diligent during the entire period he seeks to toll. See Rashid v. Mukasey, supra. He indicates that as an uneducated taxi driver with a ninth-grade education, he could not have deduced the gravity of the fraudulent and unethical behavior of Mr. Howard. While the respondent explains that he did not know that he had been ordered removed in absentia in December 2002, and that he had contact with Mr. Howard in 2003, the respondent also states in his letter to Mr. Howard dated August 24, 2011, that Mr. Howard was not responsive to the respondent’s request for a copy of his files and he never heard from him again. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Exh. 15. The respondent has not stated that he contacted any other attorneys from 2003 until consulting with current counsel and filing a motion to reopen in June 2012. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not exercise due diligence as required for equitable tolling. See Rashid v. Mukasey, supra. Consequently, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul C. Agu, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christian Parke
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 17, 2012, denying his motion to reopen proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under a clearly erroneous standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent filed an untimely motion reopen arguing that the time limit for filing the motion should be equitably tolled due to the ineffective assistance of former counsel. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the motion is defective because it does not substantially comply with the procedural requirements outlined in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), or present a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (substantial fulfillment of the procedural requirements of Lozada, supra, is generally necessary to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel unless the record reflects a clear and obvious case of such). Moreover, the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by any of prior counsel’s actions or failure to act in this matter. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004) (a claim of ineffective representation must show that the allegedly deficient performance of former counsel may have affected the outcome in the case). The respondent merely makes vague assertions that his communications with prior counsel were “quite deplorable,” that “nothing meaningful was accomplished” at his one meeting with prior counsel, and that he was not informed of all possible relief available to him in these proceedings. While citing to pertinent case law, the brief submitted by the respondent on appeal reflects a similar lack of detail concerning the attorney-client relationship, and is devoid of any substantive argument to support the claim that the performance of prior counsel was deficient.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Genet Getachew, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider the Board’s May 9, 2013, decision dismissing his appeal from the Immigration Judge denial of a motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The respondent has not identified an error of fact or law in our prior order, but instead reasserts that his failure to appear at the January 17, 2012, hearing was the result of events which were out of his control. Specifically, he asserts that his attorney mailed the hearing notice to his obligor rather than to him. We considered these assertions in or prior order. We emphasized that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent, and that the respondent did not set forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel to constitute exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985). As the respondent has not shown that our prior order contained an error of fact or law, the motion to reconsider is denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of China, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 27, 2011. In that decision, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent has not shown “good cause” for any further adjournment of the proceedings (I.J. at 3), and the Immigration Judge sustained the charge of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) (I.J. at 4-5).1 See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6 (2013). Following the filing of the Notice of Appeal, we established a briefing schedule according to which the respondent’s appeal brief was due on February 10, 2012. The respondent did not submit a brief before the deadline. Instead, the respondent filed a motion to remand on April 11, 2013, in which she contends that her prior counsel by whom she was represented below and who initially represented her in this appeal provided ineffective assistance.2 See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Rivas, 26 I&N Dec. 130, 135 (BIA 2013) (“Motions to remand, like motions to reopen, are discretionary in nature, and the requirements for a motion to remand are essentially the same as for a motion to reopen.” (citing Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127, 138 (BIA 2009) and Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 256-57 (BIA 1985))). However, the respondent’s motion to remand will be denied, and the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent’s Notice of Appeal asserts that the respondent has been “““improperly charged” and argues without citation to evidence in the record of proceeding or the support of meaningful legal analysis that the respondent is not inadmissible under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Act. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(b). The Notice of Appeal reflects that the respondent intended to support her appeal with a subsequent appeal brief but, as already stated, that has not happened. Under these circumstances, we will dismiss the respondent’s appeal. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 820 (9th Cir. 2003) (“If the BIA was forced to decipher general statements of error, unsupported by specific factual or legal references, the BIA would have to spend time and resources reconstructing the proceedings before the IJ and building the petitioner’s legal case, in some instances only to conclude that the appeal was utterly without merit.” (citing Matter of Holguin, 13 I&N Dec 423, 424 (BIA 1969))); Matter of Keyte, 20 I&N Dec. 158, 159 (BIA 1990) (summarily dismissing an appeal where aliens alleged in Notice of Appeal that Immigration Judge’s decision was “unfair,” indicated intent to file a brief or written statement but did not and “neglected to specify whether the alleged error in the immigration judge’s decision lies with his interpretation of the facts or his application of legal standards.”).
 
*2 For the purpose of adjudicating the respondent’s motion to remand based on the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we will presume for the time being that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements for such claims as delineated in Matter of Lozada, supra. See, e.g., Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 937 n. 4 (9th Cir. 2003) (“We seldom reject ineffective assistance of counsel claims solely on the basis of Lozada deficiencies.” (citing Melkonian v. Ashcroft, 320 F.3d 1061, 1072 (9th Cir. 2003) and Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000))). According to the respondent’s declaration submitted in support of the motion (“Declaration of Liu, Zhe”), her prior counsel acted ineffectively by failing to: (1) inform the respondent of the availability of withholding of removal or any other alternative relief from removal; (2) file a Petition for Alien Relative of which the respondent is the intended beneficiary with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”); and (3) submit an appeal brief in support of the instant appeal. We will address each allegation in turn.
 
First, we accept that an attorney’s failure to advise his alien client of relief from removal for with the alien is eligible constitutes ineffective assistance. However, the respondent has not established that she is eligible for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), or under the regulations implementing the Convention Against Torture. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c).
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not a form of relief from removal. Rather, the ineffectiveness claim attempts to show that the respondent’s former counsel prejudiced her ability or opportunity to apply for withholding of removal. However, the prejudice only arises if the respondent can show a prima facie case for relief. In order to do this, the respondent must, at a minimum, claim that she faces a clear probability of prospective persecution or torture in China. Accordingly, she must submit an application for withholding of removal in support of the motion to remand, which “shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.” See section 240(c)(7)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(B); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent has not supported the motion to reopen with any applications for relief and no evidence relevant to her (theoretical) claim for withholding of removal. Thus, the respondent has not established that she was prejudiced by her former counsel’s assistance in this regard.3 See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003) (“To show a deprivation of due process caused by ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien must show that counsel’s ineffective performance prejudiced her.”).
 
*3 Second, the former counsel’s alleged failure to file a Petition for Alien Relative before USCIS is beyond the scope of the instant removal proceedings. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 106-07 (BIA 2009). Furthermore, the respondent was not yet married to the United States citizen spouse during the proceedings before the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 24-25).
 
And finally, accepting that the failure to file an appeal brief can constitute ineffective assistance, the respondent has once again not shown prejudice arising from this failure. That is, the respondent, through present counsel, has not elaborated on the allegations of error in the Notice to Appear, or otherwise asserted any independent allegations of error in the Immigration Judge’s September 27, 2011, decision. Without a showing that the Immigration Judge’s decision contained reversible factual or legal error, the respondent has not established prejudice from former counsel’s failure to file a supporting appeal brief. Cf. Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, supra, at 826 (“All the king’s horses and all the king’s men and the very best counsel in the world could not induce a contrary decision on this record on appeal to the BIA.”).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied, and the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The Immigration Judge declined to reach the charge of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act (I.J. at 5).

2

The respondent initially filed the motion to remand on March 6, 2013, but the respondent used an incorrect alien registration number on the filing, and so, we returned it.

We note that, when the Immigration Judge asked the respondent if she has “any fear of returning to China . . .,” the respondent was nonresponsive to the question (Tr. at 9). In addition, the record reflects that the Immigration Judge asked the respondent’s former counsel, “[I]s this going to be a withholding case?” The respondent’s counsel stated that it would not be (Tr. at 13, 24).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Dominick S. Cardinale, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dara F. Reid
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; rescission
 
*1 On January 5, 2010, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal in absentia, and on February 23, 2011, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 11, 2010, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order. This case was last before the Board on August 30, 2011, when it denied the respondent’s untimely motion to reconsider its February 23, 2011, decision. On May 23, 2013, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
An alien may file only one motion to reopen and it must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); section 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i). An exception to the time and number restrictions exists for orders entered in absentia. See Maghradze v. Gonzales, 462 F.3d 150, 152 n. 1 (2d Cir. 2006); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i), 1003.23(b)(4). The exception provides that an order of removal entered in absentia may be rescinded upon the filing of a motion to reopen within 180 days after the date of the order of removal, if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, or upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive proper notice of the hearing.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may satisfy the exceptional circumstances requirement and may also serve to equitably toll the limitations period for filing a motion to reopen. See Twum v. I.N.S., 411 F.3d 54, 59 n. 4 (2d Cir. 2005); Iavorski v. I.N.S., 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir.2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (B.I.A.1988). However, “[f]or an untimely claim to receive the benefit of equitable tolling . . . an alien must demonstrate not only that the alien’s constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll.” Iavorski v. I.N.S., supra, at 135; see also Cekic v. I.N.S., 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting that “an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled”).
 
*2 The respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of his former attorney, Dominick Sorrentino, Esquire. He has not, however, shown that he has exercised due diligence in bringing this matter before the Board. See Cekic v. I.N.S., supra. The respondent claims that that “[c]ounsel failed to notify (him) of the date and time of . . . hearing” on January 5, 2010. Upon receipt of the Immigration Judge’s February 11, 2010, decision, however, the respondent was made aware that the Immigration Judge determined that he had received proper notice of the scheduled removal hearing, and that the illness which prevented Attorney Sorrentino from attending the hearing “did not relieve the respondent of attending the hearing in his own right.”1 See Immigration Judge’s February 11, 2010, Decision, at 2. Nevertheless, the respondent did not file the instant motion for more than 2 years after the Immigration Judge’s decision. Further, the respondent has not explained the delay in bringing this motion to reopen and rescind before the Board. Accordingly, equitable tolling of the motions filing period is not warranted in this case, and the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and rescind is denied.

We also note that prior counsel filed a response to the respondent’s claims in which he states that at a master calendar hearing on March 24, 2009, he and the Immigration Judge told the respondent that next hearing date was January 5, 2010, and that he repeated this notice to the respondent several times thereafter. See Attorney Sorrentino’s Response at 2.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mark R. Barr, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lillian Alves
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board’s decision in this matter entered on December 7, 2009, sustained an appeal of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for further consideration. The Immigration Judge’s August 2, 2011, decision denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status. The Board entered the final administrative decision when this matter was last before us on February 14, 2013; our order dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision.1 The respondent filed this motion to reopen his removal proceedings on May 15, 2013. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7). The DHS has filed a memorandum opposing the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The Board may consider a timely motion to reopen if it is supported by evidence of material new facts to be proven at a reopened hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The new evidence must have been previously unavailable and must be likely to lead to a different outcome in the respondent’s case. Id., see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1988) (explaining that a party who seeks to reopen proceedings before the Immigration Judge, with all the attendant delays, bears a “heavy burden” of proving that the new evidence would likely change the result in the case).
 
The evidence that the respondent offers in support of this motion was available previously, but the motion claims that it was not presented to the Immigration Judge due to ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of Attorney Litman, who represented the respondent at the hearing. The Board held in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), that an alien’s due process rights may be violated when ineffective assistance of counsel prevents the fundamental fairness of the proceeding and the alien shows prejudice.
 
The Immigration Judge found the respondent to be inadmissible, and therefore ineligible for adjustment of status, on the basis of “reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence” giving “reason to believe” that he has been an illicit drug trafficker or “a knowing aider, abettor, assister, conspirator, or colluder” in illicit drug trafficking. See section 212(a)(2)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C); Decision of the Board, Feb. 14, 2013, at 1. The Immigration Judge relied on specific evidence in the record, including police reports and sworn witness statements, indicating the respondent’s direct involvement in selling methamphetamine and cocaine as part of a network headed by his brother. There were at least five informants or witnesses who stated that the respondent served as a “runner” for his brother, and the statements were consistent and corroborative. See id. at 2; I.J. at 5-7.
 
*2 The respondent denies involvement. He asserts that Attorney Litman was ineffective in not submitting to the Immigration Judge approximately 696 pages of transcripts from the criminal trial in which the respondent was acquitted of several counts of possession or distribution of controlled substances, as well as several character references (who express their regard for the respondent and disbelief that he would be a drug trafficker, but do not rebut the specific information considered by the Immigration Judge). See Motion to Reopen, Tabs A, B.
 
The Immigration Judge and Board were aware of the acquittal. As we noted in our prior decision, the acquittal did not end the inquiry for immigration purposes. The jury in the criminal case considered whether the state had proven certain specific, charged acts of drug possession or distribution beyond a reasonable doubt, based on evidence admitted at trial. The Immigration Judge considered whether there is “reason to believe” that the respondent has been involved in trafficking, based on statements of informants gathered in the course of a law enforcement investigation. The Immigration Judge was required to consider whether the informants’ statements constitute evidence that is “““reasonable, substantial, and probative,” even though such statements may not have been admissible into evidence at a criminal trial.
 
The transcripts of the criminal trial include the testimony of three prosecution witnesses, all of whom testified that the respondent participated in his brother’s drug trade. See, e.g., Motion to Reopen, Tab A at 173-81, 297-98, 356. The motion to reopen focuses on the difficulties the prosecution faced in obtaining a conviction. The transcripts contain information that is significantly damaging to the respondent, however, when viewed from the standpoint of a civil matter in which the respondent must show that he warrants an extraordinary grant of discretionary relief. In considering the present motion, it appears to the Board that Attorney Litman’s decision not to offer the criminal trial transcripts at the hearing before the Immigration Judge may have been a reasonable strategic decision. We cannot say that the decision not to introduce the transcripts was egregious. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639 (noting that litigants are generally bound by the conduct of their attorneys, absent egregious circumstances). The motion fails to demonstrate egregious circumstances, or that the addition of the transcripts to the record before the Immigration Judge would change the outcome of the respondent’s case.
 
The Board concludes that ineffectiveness of counsel and prejudice have not been adequately demonstrated. We do not find that reopening of these proceedings has been shown to be warranted. See Matter of Coelho, supra, at 472-73. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
*3 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Juan C. Blanco, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Maria T. Armas
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Nicaragua, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of January 7, 2013. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia on December 8, 2010. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts.
 
The respondent alleges in her December 19, 2012, motion that she received ineffective assistance by Mr. Marlon Alberto Gonzalez, who represented to the respondent that he was an attorney. Specifically, the respondent maintains that Mr. Gonzalez told her not to appear for her December 8, 2010, hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion as numerically barred,1 and also noted that it was untimely filed.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “““exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996). Here, the respondent has partially complied with the Lozada requirements. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir. 2003) (a petitioner seeking to show ineffective assistance must meet each of the three screening requirements of Lozada, even where counsel’s ineffective assistance was clear on the record). We need not address whether the respondent adequately complied with the Lozada requirements or the Immigration Judge’s finding that the motion is numerically barred2 because the motion was properly found untimely.
 
Moreover, the respondent has not shown that she exercised due diligence. See Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 713 F.3d 1357, 1358 (11th 2013) (finding that equitable tolling generally requires litigant to show (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way). In her December 19, 2012, motion to reopen, the respondent indicates that she suspected “foul play” from Mr. Gonzalez at least by August 2011. Yet the respondent did not seek new counsel until July 2012, and the motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance by Mr. Gonzalez was not filed until December 19, 2012. Consequently, we find that the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by delaying over a year in raising the issue.
 
*2 We find that the respondent has not established an exceptional circumstance herein to warrant the sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). With regard to the respondent’s argument that the DHS should exercise its prosecutorial discretion, the decision of whether to exercise its prosecutorial discretion is a matter solely within the purview of the DHS, and neither the Immigration Judge, nor this Board, has jurisdiction to review such matter. See Matter of Bahta, 22 I&N Dec. 1381, 1392 (BIA 2000).
 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated May 25, 2012, denying his motion to reopen.1 We will dismiss the appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. As the respondent filed his motion to reopen on April 10, 2012, more than 11 years after he was ordered removed from the United States on September 13, 2000, his motion to reopen was untimely under the general rule requiring an alien to file a motion to reopen within 90 days of the entry of an order of removal. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). While the respondent alleges that his former counsel provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not established that he exercised the requisite due diligence needed to warrant equitable tolling of the 90-day filing deadline or that an exceptional situation exists which would warrant sua sponte reopening. See e.g., Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 131-32 (2d Cir. 2008); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006); Iavorski v.

Mark Evans
Associate Regional Counsel
BEFORE: Board Panel: MULLANE and CREPPY, Board Members; LIEBOWITZ, Temporary Board Member.
CREPPY, Board Member:
In a decision dated March 11, 2011, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, finding that it was both time and number barred, and he declined to sua sponte reopen the respondent’s removal proceedings. The respondent has appealed from that decision. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
  
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of China who arrived in the United States on March 20, 1999. He was ordered removed in absentia on August 9, 1999, after failing to appear at a hearing. On September 2, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen to rescind the in absentia order of removal based on lack of notice pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii) (2006). He also sought reopening based on changed country conditions.
 
On November 12, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen to rescind the in absentia removal order, concluding that *162 he had received proper notice of the hearing. However, the Immigration Judge did not address the respondent’s assertions regarding changed country conditions. The respondent did not appeal the denial of the motion.
 
On January 2, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider the November 12, 2008, decision, arguing that the Immigration Judge should have considered his claim of changed country conditions. On April 16, 2009, the Immigration Judge denied the motion because it was untimely. The respondent did not appeal the denial of his motion to reconsider.
 
On February 28, 2011, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen seeking to apply for asylum and withholding of removal. First, the respondent requested reopening of his removal proceedings based on a claim of changed country conditions arising in China since the date of his last hearing pursuant to section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act. In support of his request he submitted evidence that he stated was material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the time of his August 1999 hearing. Second, he asserted that his motion was not time barred because he is entitled to equitable tolling as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel and due process violations. Finally, he argued that the Immigration Judge should reopen the proceedings sua sponte.
 
**2 The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s second motion to reopen, concluding that it was both time and number barred. In analyzing the respondent’s request to reopen proceedings based on changed country conditions, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent could not reopen proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of removal because he was first required to rescind his in absentia removal order under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. The Immigration Judge further determined that even if the respondent could seek reopening based on changed country conditions without first rescinding the in absentia order, his motion would nevertheless be denied as time barred. Since it was not the first motion the respondent filed, the Immigration Judge also found it to be number barred. For these reasons, the Immigration Judge did not reach the merits of the respondent’s motion. Finally, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not present any exceptional circumstances that would justify reopening the proceedings sua sponte.
  
II. ISSUES
 
The issues before us are: (1) whether an alien who is subject to an in absentia removal order must first rescind the order before he can seek to reopen removal proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions; and (2) whether such a motion to reopen is subject to the general numerical limitations on motions to reopen.
 
*163 We conclude that although the respondent is subject to an in absentia removal order, he does not have to first rescind the order before he can seek reopening to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions arising in China. We also hold that the numerical limitations on filing a motion to reopen in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (2013) are not applicable because the respondent seeks reopening to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions arising in China.
  
III. APPLICABLE LAW
 
Prior to 1990, there were no limitations governing the filing of motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 103.5, 242.22 (1989). However, in 1990 Congress added former section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b (1994), which provided consequences for an alien’s failure to appear at a deportation hearing and a procedure for rescinding an in absentia deportation order through a motion to reopen. Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, § 545(a), 104 Stat. 4978, 5061-62 (“IMMACT 90”). Section 242B(e) provided that an alien who was subject to an in absentia deportation order was ineligible for certain forms of discretionary relief for a period of 5 years. Notably, asylum was not one of the forms of relief for which an alien would remain ineligible for the 5-year period. Furthermore, the statute did not specify that an alien was required to first rescind an in absentia order before applying for other available relief. It also did not indicate whether an order of exclusion could be entered in absentia, and it included no procedure to govern the reopening of an in absentia order entered in an exclusion hearing. See former section 236(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) (1994).
 
**3 As part of IMMACT 90, Congress also instructed the Attorney General to ““issue regulations with respect to . . . the period of time in which motions to reopen and to reconsider may be offered in deportation proceedings, which regulations include a limitation on the number of such motions that may be filed and a maximum time period for the filing of such motions.” IMMACT 90 § 545(d), 104 Stat. at 5066. In response to this mandate, the Attorney General promulgated regulations providing that “a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings . . . and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered.” 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.2(c)(2), 3.23b)(4)(i) (1997).
 
The regulations also created exceptions to the 90-day filing deadline for: (1) motions to reopen deportation proceedings to rescind an in absentia order of deportation; (2) motions to reopen to apply for asylum or withholding of deportation based on changed country conditions; and *164 (3) motions jointly filed by both parties. 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.2(c)(3)(i)-(iii), 3.23(b)(4)(i)-(iii). On July 1, 1996, the Attorney General implemented the final regulations governing motions to reopen. Executive Office for Immigration Review; Motions and Appeals in Immigration Proceedings; Correction, 61 Fed. Reg. 32,924 (June 26, 1996).
 
In 1996, Congress enacted the language of the current statute, which codified the restrictions on motions to reopen to rescind an in absentia order of removal. Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Div. C, Pub. L. No. 104-208, § 304(a)(3), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-590, 3009-593 (“IIRIRA”). At that time, the statute provided the following exceptions to the 90-day deadline: (1) no time limit for motions to reopen to apply for asylum and withholding based on changed country conditions; (2) 180 days after the entry of the final order of removal for motions to reopen to rescind an in absentia order if failure to appear was based on exceptional circumstances; and (3) no time limit for motions to reopen to rescind an in absentia order if the alien did not receive notice. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i)-(ii), (c)(6)(C)(ii)-(iii) of the Act. The statute was later redesignated as section 240(c)(7) of the Act. REAL ID Act of 2005, Div. B, Pub. L. No. 109-13, § 101(d)(1), 119 Stat. 302, 304.
  
III. ANALYSIS
  
A. Reopening To Apply for Asylum and Withholding of Removal Based on Changed Country Conditions
 
With this background in mind, we now turn to the question whether the current statute and regulations allow an alien who is subject to an in absentia removal order to reopen the proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions without also seeking to rescind the removal order. As in any case involving statutory interpretation, the touchstone of our analysis is the plain language of the statute. Lamie v. U.S. Trustee, 540 U.S. 526, 534 (2004) (citing Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson, 525 U.S. 432, 438 (1999)).
 
**4 Generally, a motion to reopen removal proceedings must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of a final order of removal, and only one motion may be filed. Sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1) (2013). The relevant statutory exceptions to the filing deadlines are articulated in sections 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) and (iii) of the Act. According to section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii), the 90-day deadline does not apply if the basis of the motion is to apply for asylum or withholding of removal and is based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality, if the evidence to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous *165 proceeding. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), 1003.23(b)(4)(i) (stating that the time and numerical limits are inapplicable if the basis for reopening is to apply for asylum or withholding of removal based on changed country conditions). Section 240(c)(7)(C)(iii) of the Act provides that the filing deadlines for a motion to reopen an order entered in absentia are listed in section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, which states that an in absentia order of removal may only be rescinded:
(i) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (e)(1)), or
 
(ii) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of section 239(a) or the alien demonstrates that the alien was in Federal or State custody and the failure to appear was through no fault of the alien.
 
See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i), 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (providing that only one motion to reopen seeking rescission of an in absentia order entered in removal proceedings may be filed).
 
Thus, the only way an alien can rescind an in absentia order is by demonstrating (1) that there were exceptional circumstances; (2) that the alien did not receive notice; or (3) that he or she was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his or her own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Although the statute outlines how an alien may rescind an in absentia order, nothing in either the statute or the regulations governing motions to reopen prohibits an alien from seeking to reopen proceedings for the limited purpose of applying for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions without rescinding the in absentia order of removal.
 
**5 The textual structure of the Act supports our conclusion that rescission is not required to reopen proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of removal. Congress listed the bases for seeking reopening in separate and independent sections of the Act. See sections 240(c)(7)(C)(ii)-(iv) of the Act (entitled “Asylum,” “Failure to Appear,” and “Special Rule for Battered Spouses, Children, and Parents”). Thus, the filing deadlines for reopening are different depending on whether the reason for reopening is to apply for asylum, rescind an in absentia order, or seek relief as a result of being battered. Id.; see also section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act.
 
The legislative history of section 240 of the Act provides no meaningful guidance on this question because the explanatory material simply paraphrases the language of the statute. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-828 (1996), available at 1996 WL 563320; H.R. Rep. No. 104-469(I) (1996), available at 1996 WL 168955. In examining the legislative history that accompanies the statute creating the filing deadlines and exceptions *166 governing motions to reopen, we find nothing that requires aliens who seek to reopen proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions to first rescind an in absentia order.
 
Our holding today is consistent with our prior precedent, which held that, in certain circumstances, an alien who is subject to an in absentia order could seek to reopen deportation or exclusion proceedings without also rescinding the in absentia order. In Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349, 356-57 (BIA 1998) (en banc), which interpreted former section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act in the context of deportation proceedings, we concluded that an order of deportation entered in absentia need not always be rescinded before the proceedings may be reopened.1 In reaching that conclusion, we relied on the fact that nothing in the Act or regulations specifically required an in absentia order to be rescinded before proceedings could be reopened, noting that the statute merely described the procedure for rescinding such an order. Id. at 352, 356.
 
Although there was no provision in either the statute or regulations that addressed in absentia orders in exclusion proceedings, we held in Matter of A-N- & R-M-N-, 22 I&N Dec. 953, 955-56 (BIA 1999), that exclusion proceedings conducted in absentia could be reopened in the absence of a showing of ““reasonable cause” where the alien sought reopening to apply for asylum or withholding of deportation and demonstrated changed country conditions that indicated a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits. See 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii)(B) (1998) (providing that a motion to reopen exclusion proceedings on the basis that an Immigration Judge improperly entered an in absentia order must show that the alien had “reasonable cause” for failing to appear). In so finding, we were persuaded by the fact that the aliens were not challenging the propriety of the in absentia order. Id. at 956.
 
**6 Given that the language in section 240(c)(7) of the Act is substantially similar to former section 242B, we find that the reasoning in Matter of M-S- is applicable in the context of removal proceedings. Section 242B(e)(1) provided that an alien subject to an in absentia deportation order was ineligible for certain forms of discretionary relief for a period of 5 years. We noted in Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. at 355, that if Congress intended to require an alien who was subject to an in absentia deportation order to *167 rescind that order before applying for relief, it would render the language of former section 242B(e)(1) surplusage.2
 
The same reasoning applies in removal proceedings. Section 240(b)(7) of the Act explicitly bars an alien with an in absentia removal order from reopening his or her case to apply for certain forms of discretionary relief within 10 years from the date of the final order of removal. According to section 240(b)(7),
Any alien against whom a final order of removal is entered in absentia under this subsection and who . . . was provided oral notice, either in the alien’s native language or in another language the alien understands, of the time and place of the proceedings and of the consequences under this paragraph of failing, other than because of exceptional circumstances . . ., to attend a proceeding under this section, shall not be eligible for relief under section 240A, 240B, 245, 248, or 249 for a period of 10 years after the date of the entry of the final order of removal.
 
 
It is well settled that no provision of law should be construed so as to render superfluous other provisions in the same statute. Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 778 (1988). Thus, section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act must be read together with section 240(b)(7) to ascertain its meaning. If we determined that rescission of an in absentia removal order is a condition precedent to reopening removal proceedings, then section 240(b)(7) would be surplusage, because the effect of rescinding an in absentia removal order is that an alien essentially “starts over.” Thus, there are no bars to discretionary relief once an in absentia order is rescinded.
 
If section 240(b)(7) of the Act is to be given some effect, therefore, it must be applied to an alien who is subject to an in absentia removal order, but who seeks reopening without also rescinding the order. In those situations, section 240(b)(7) would apply to bar the alien from applying for the enumerated forms of discretionary relief for a period of 10 years, as long as the alien was given the required notice for failure to appear. We note, however, that asylum was not one of the forms of relief for which an alien subject to an in absentia order would remain ineligible for the 5-year period under former section 242B(e) of the Act or for the 10-year period under section 240(b)(7).
 
**7 Finally, requiring an alien to first rescind an in absentia order of removal before reopening to apply for asylum or withholding of removal would effectively bar an alien who met the requirements for reopening *168 under section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act from having an asylum or withholding of removal claim adjudicated.
 
In sum, based on our analysis of the past and present statutes, we hold that an alien who is subject to an in absentia removal order need not first rescind the order before seeking reopening of the proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions arising in the country of the alien’s nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered.3
  
B. Numerical Limitations on Motions To Reopen
 
The Immigration Judge also determined that, even assuming that an alien who is subject to an in absentia removal order can reopen proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions without rescinding the removal order, the respondent’s current motion is barred by the numerical limitation on filing motions to reopen because he had previously filed another motion. In so holding, the Immigration Judge concluded that section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act only waives the time limitation on motions to reopen, but not the numerical limitation of section 240(c)(7)(A).
 
The statute is silent regarding any numerical exception for motions to reopen to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions. However, we and the Immigration Judges are bound by the current regulations, which specifically waive both the time and numerical limitations for such motions. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), 1003.23(b)(4)(i).4 There is no indication in the legislative history of section 240(c)(7) that in enacting the IIRIRA, Congress did not intend to also *169 waive the numerical limitation, as the regulations had previously done. See 8 C.F.R. § § 3.2(c)(2)(ii), 3.23b)(4)(ii) (1997).
 
The respondent filed a second motion to reopen to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions in China. Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i), such a motion is not subject to the numerical limitations in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). We therefore conclude that the Immigration Judge improperly determined that the respondent’s motion to reopen was numerically barred.
  
C. Respondent’s Motion To Reopen
 
Turning to the respondent’s motion to reopen, we note that in seeking to reopen to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions, an alien must meet the requirements set forth in section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Therefore, in addition to showing changed country conditions, an alien must submit evidence that is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the prior hearing. Additionally, an alien seeking reopening must establish prima facie eligibility for the underlying relief sought. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988). Thus, the alien bears a heavy burden to show that his proffered evidence is material, reflects changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality, and supports a prima facie case for a grant of asylum. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992). Finally, where the ultimate relief is discretionary, a moving party must also show that a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. at 323.
 
**8 The respondent filed a motion to reopen for the purpose of applying for asylum and withholding of removal based on his religious conversion and the alleged increase in persecution of underground Catholic churches in China. Based on the above analysis, we conclude that the Immigration Judge had jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s motion and that the respondent was not required to first rescind the in absentia removal order before seeking to reopen his removal proceedings. Moreover, since the basis of the respondent’s motion is to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions, the numerical limitations in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) do not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i).
 
The Immigration Judge did not address the merits of the respondent’s argument that reopening of the proceedings is warranted because of changed country conditions in China. Nor did he evaluate whether the evidence the respondent submitted in support of his motion is material and *170 was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the prior hearing. We therefore find that a remand of the record is appropriate.5 Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). On remand, the Immigration Judge should evaluate whether the evidence submitted by the respondent indicates a reasonable likelihood that his application will succeed on the merits if the proceedings are reopened.
 
In view of our disposition of the respondent’s appeal, it is not necessary to address his remaining contentions. See INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25-26 (1976) (stating that, as a general rule, courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 465 (BIA 2002).
  
V. CONCLUSION
 
In sum, we conclude that an alien who is subject to an in absentia removal order need not first rescind the order before seeking reopening of the proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions arising in the country of the alien’s nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered. We further hold that the numerical limitations on filing a motion to reopen in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) are not applicable to an alien seeking reopening to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions arising in the country of the alien’s nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
**9 ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
 
Footnotes

1

We held that an alien who did not receive the oral warnings of the consequences of failing to appear at a deportation hearing, was ordered deported in absentia, and later became eligible for adjustment of status could request reopening without also seeking to rescind the in absentia order of deportation where the motion to reopen was filed within 90 days of the final order. Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. at 356-57.

2

In addition, we noted that “[a] limited interpretation of section 242B(c)(1) of the Act would also be consistent with the language of the newly amended statute at sections 240(b)(5)(C) and (7) of the Act.” Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. at 356.

3

We address only the situation in the case before us, where the alien, who is subject to an in absentia order of removal, filed a motion to reopen seeking to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions under section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) more than 10 years later.

4

Specifically, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i), which relates to motions to reopen before the Immigration Judge, provides that the numerical bar
shall not apply if the basis of the motion is to apply for asylum . . . or withholding of removal . . . and is based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.
Motions to reopen before the Board are subject to similar requirements under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).

5

We do not now consider whether the respondent has, in fact, shown changed country conditions arising in China since the date of his last hearing.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Philip M. Alterman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kalin Ivany
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This matter was last before the Board on May 7, 2013, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s January 26, 2012, decision. At that time, we also declined to reinstate the period of voluntary departure that had been granted by the Immigration Judge, finding that the respondent failed to present proof of payment of the voluntary departure bond within 30 days of filing the appeal, as required by regulations that became effective on January 20, 2009. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3)(ii). The respondent’s unopposed motion to reopen will be granted.
 
The respondent seeks to have the Board reopen that aspect of our decision relating to voluntary departure. The respondent has submitted evidence that the departure bond had previously been paid. The motion asserts that the evidence was omitted due to claimed ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) states that it is unopposed to the motion. In light of the evidence submitted and considering the totality of the circumstances, the unopposed motion shall be granted. Accordingly, the following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The pending motion is granted for the limited purpose of reinstating voluntary departure.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See Voluntary Departure: Effect of a Motion To Reopen or Reconsider or a Petition for Review, 73 Fed. Reg. 76,927, 937-38 (Dec. 18, 2008) (codified at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c)(3)(iii), (e)(1)).
 
*2 WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 73 Fed. Reg. at 76938 (codified at 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i)).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nita Dobroshi, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Randall Duncan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 On May 7, 2012, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States, and appeal was waived. See I.J. dec. at 2; Tr. at 8. Nevertheless, the respondent filed two Notices of Appeal forms through different counsel. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction on August 23, 2012, noting that the respondent did not assert or argue that the decision to waive appeal was not knowingly and intelligently made. We also observed that the respondent did not contend that he was provided with ineffective assistance of counsel at the hearing, nor had he demonstrated compliance with the threshold requirements for making such a claim. The respondent’s motion to reopen, alleging ineffective assistance by two prior attorneys in the waiver of the appeal and prior representation before the Board, was received on May 21, 2013. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The pending motion is untimely. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The United States Court of Appeals has held that equitable tolling of the time limit may be available in certain circumstances where there is ineffective assistance. See Ruiz-Turcios v. U.S. Att’y Gen., __ F.3d. __, 2013 WL 2262470 (11th Cir. 2013). In this case, the respondent claims ineffective assistance was provided by his former attorneys in conjunction with the waiver of appeal. However, the respondent has not shown substantial compliance with the requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Dakane v. United States Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005). Although the respondent has filed complaints against two attorneys with the Office of the General Counsel (OGC), he has not shown that he has filed any complaint against either attorney with the applicable state bar association. In addition, while each former attorney was notified that he filed an Immigration Practitioner Complaint form with the OGC, neither notification letter specified that the respondent was seeking reopening before the Board based on ineffective assistance allegations. Consequently, the respondent’s former attorneys were not made aware of the pending motion or their ability to respond to the allegations before the Board. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied. The Board’s May 24, 2013, order granting a stay of removal is vacated.

File: AXXX XX7 569 - West Valley, UT

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
German T. Flores, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeffrey D. Clark
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native of Ivory Coast and citizen of Burkina Faso, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 5, 2013. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal. On appeal, the respondent argues that he was denied his right to counsel. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On July 13, 2012, the respondent was convicted of Possession of a Controlled Substance (Marijuana) with Intent to Manufacture or Deliver, in violation of Idaho law. That conviction was not appealed. The detained respondent was placed in removal proceedings on July 16, 2012. His first hearing was on February 5, 2013. At that time, the respondent told the Immigration Judge that he had been consulting an attorney in Utah (Mr. Flores), and was told to ask for a 2-week continuance to enable counsel to represent him. The Immigration Judge granted him a 2-week continuance (Tr. at 8-9). On February 19, 2013, the respondent told the Immigration Judge that he had negotiated an agreement with an attorney (Mr. Flores), and he was having money wired to him that week. On that basis, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent a 1-week continuance, but he told the respondent that, if the attorney did not appear, he would have to represent himself (Tr. at 11-12).
 
On February 25, 2013, nothing was said about the Utah attorney (Mr. Flores). The respondent provided the Immigration Judge with the card of an attorney in Idaho (Mr. Sutton) and asked him to call him. When he did so, the attorney was not there, and the receptionist said that the attorney had not yet been retained. The Immigration Judge gave the respondent another 1-week continuance to enable counsel to file his notice of appearance (Tr. at 18-20). On March 4, 2013, the respondent told a new Immigration Judge that he had hired an attorney in Idaho to help him pursue post-conviction relief. Nothing was said about the Utah attorney (Mr. Flores). The Immigration Judge considered giving him another continuance to hire an attorney, but the attorney for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) advised her that the respondent had already received 3 continuances. The Immigration Judge then concluded that he had been allowed sufficient time to hire an attorney and would be required to represent himself because he had received 3 continuances, because he was in custody, and because he was a mandatory detainee (Tr. at 22-23). The Immigration Judge then proceeded to take pleadings, found the respondent removable, found him ineligible for relief from removal, and ordered him removed (Tr. at 23-27).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent argues that he was given insufficient time to retain counsel and was thereby denied his right to counsel.
 
Respondents in immigration proceedings have the statutory and regulatory “““privilege of being represented,” at no expense to the Government, by counsel of their choosing. See sections 240(b)(4)(A), 292 of the Act; 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(4)(A), 1362. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.16(b), 1240.3, 1240.10(a), 1240.11(c)(1)(iii); Matter of C-B-, 25 I&N Dec. 888 (BIA 2012). Where the statutory and regulatory privilege of legal representation is not expressly waived, as is the case here, in order to meaningfully effectuate the privilege, the Immigration Judge must grant a reasonable and realistic amount of time and provide a fair opportunity for a respondent to seek, speak with, and retain counsel. See Matter of C-B-, supra. Moreover, an Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.298, 1240.6. See also Matter of C-B-, supra. Cf. Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not show good cause for another continuance. He had 3 continuances amounting to a 1-month period. In light of the facts presented, we conclude that he was granted a reasonable and realistic amount of time and provided a fair opportunity to seek, speak with, and retain counsel.
 
The respondent is represented on appeal by the attorney who he was attempting to retain since his first hearing on February 5, 2013. While he had been in contact with counsel from February 5, 2013, counsel did not submit an entry of appearance during the course of that month. Moreover, counsel has not explained to the Immigration Judge or this Board why he did not file an entry of appearance during the course of that month.
 
On appeal, the respondent also requests remand on the grounds that the conviction, which serves as the basis for removal, and which renders him ineligible for relief from removal, is being challenged before the criminal court pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).1 The respondent alleges that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his conviction, and he has filed a petition to vacate it.
 
*3 We note that the petition was not even filed until April 5, 2013, a month after the respondent’s final hearing, and the respondent does not indicate when the petition will be heard by the state court. The respondent has submitted a copy of the petition and its docket history with the appeal. However, the respondent has not submitted an affidavit from his prior criminal attorney admitting that he failed to advise the respondent concerning the immigration consequences of the plea, or misadvised him, as the respondent alleges. Nor has the respondent submitted his own affidavit indicating, under penalty of perjury, what his prior criminal attorney advised him concerning the immigration consequences of the plea. Consequently, this Board has insufficient evidence to conclude that the conviction will likely be vacated.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue the post-conviction petition, it does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The post-conviction petition to vacate the conviction does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel. See also Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. ___, 133 S.Ct. 1103 (2013) (holding that Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, which requires defense counsel to advise a defendant about the risk of deportation arising from a guilty plea, does not apply retroactively).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David H. Stoller, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Manuel Ramirez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On December 6, 2007, the Immigration Judge issued an order of removal in absentia. On June 27, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, alleging that she did not receive notice of the hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen on the ground that notice of the hearing was mailed to the respondent’s last known address of record and that this notice was sufficient. The respondent filed a timely Notice of Appeal. On July 11, 2012, the Board dismissed the appeal.
 
On April 26, 2013, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen. With new counsel, she alleges that proceedings should be reopened because her former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel. In support of this argument, the respondent presents additional evidence in support of her assertion that she did not receive the notice of hearing. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion.
 
In reviewing the record in light of the current allegations, the respondent’s affidavit, and Board precedent, we find that there is a legitimate basis to conclude that the respondent overcame the presumption of delivery regarding the notice of his December 6, 2007, hearing. See Matter of Anyelo, 25 I&N Dec. 337, 339 (BIA 2010); Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008) (presumption of delivery as to regular mail weaker than presumption that applies to certified mail); Matter of C-R-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 677 (BIA 2008) (presumption of delivery overcome where alien asserts he did not receive notice, he continued to reside at same address, and had no reason to not appear).
 
Moreover, we find that the respondent has overcome the lower presumption of delivery that attaches to regular mail. In particular, we are persuaded by the affidavits of the respondent and her brother, reflecting that they, nor anyone at their residence, received the Notice of Hearing (“NOH”). See Matter of Anyelo, supra; Matter of M-R-A-, supra; Matter of C-R-C-, supra. Under the circumstances, we conclude that the evidence of record sufficiently overcomes the presumption that the respondent received the NOH sent to her by regular mail and that her removal proceedings should be reopened. Accordingly, the following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The prior decisions are vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

Marc A. Jones
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Peru, was ordered removed from the United States, following her failure to appear for a hearing on October 17, 2007. On December 2, 2009, she filed a motion to reopen pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). Her motion to reopen was granted on December 22, 2009, and her case was rescheduled for a new master calendar hearing. On August 18, 2010, the respondent and her attorney of record failed to appear. The Immigration Judge reinstated the original in absentia order of removal and directed the respondent’s removal to Peru based on the charges contained in the Notice to Appear (“NTA”). On September 1, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. In a decision dated October 3, 2011, the Immigration Judge denied reopening. This appeal follows. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of fact by an Immigration Judge only to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying reopening. The respondent does not dispute that she received the NTA on August 30, 2007, which contained the consequences for failing to appear at a scheduled removal hearing. She contends, however, that she never received notice of the August 18, 2010, hearing date and at no time did her attorney inform her that her matter had been set for that date. See December 2, 2009, Motion to Reopen. We have held, however, that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1995). When the court sent notice of the August 18, 2010, hearing date, it sent it to the respondent’s attorney of record, Mr. Solomon Gilliam.1 The respondent’s failure to appear for her hearing is not excused for lack of proper notice. While a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on a failure of counsel to inform his client of the time and date of the hearing can constitute exceptional circumstances, the respondent did not comply with the procedural requirements for making a proper ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Marinov v. Holder, 687 F.3d 365 (7th Cir. 2012); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) (setting forth defined procedural requirements to prove a due process violation based on the performance of counsel). See also Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505 (BIA 1980) (the assertions of counsel do not constitute evidence). Further, contrary to the respondent’s contention on appeal, the Immigration Judge did not find that her prior counsel appeared at the August 18, 2010, hearing. Rather, he noted that counsel withdrew after that date.
 
*2 Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was before the Board on February 25, 2013, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s July 22, 2011, decision denying his application for adjustment of status. The respondent filed this motion to reopen his removal proceedings on May 24, 2013, to re-apply for adjustment of status. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The Board may consider a timely motion to reopen if the motion states the new facts that would be proven at a new hearing, and is supported by affidavits or other evidence that is material and was not available at the time of the prior hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). In Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1988), the Board explained that a party who seeks to reopen proceedings bears a “heavy burden” of proving that the new evidence would likely change the result in the case.
 
As the Board noted in the prior decision, adjustment of status is an extraordinary form of relief which was not designed to supersede the regular consular process of visa issuance abroad, and may be granted only where a favorable exercised of discretion is shown to be warranted. In this case, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent “has accumulated a lengthy criminal history since his arrival in the U.S.” and has “continually flouted the laws of the U.S.,” with a record that includes multiple convictions for the same and similar offenses. See I.J. at 6. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent failed to show that the positive equities in his case outweigh the negative factors. Id.
 
In support of reopening, the respondent offers voluminous evidence, including a psychological report dated May 2013 concerning his progress in rehabilitation and recovery from alcohol dependence. See Motion to Reopen, Tab R. The report itself is new but relies extensively on information existing previously. The respondent claims in his motion that this evidence and the other evidence now presented was not obtained and presented previously due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board held in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), that due process rights may be violated when ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from reasonably presenting his case. In order to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien must demonstrate that he was prejudiced.
 
*2 The Board concludes that the respondent received a full and fair hearing at which the Immigration Judge properly considered and evaluated his evidence (including the respondent’s claim to sobriety since 2005) and correctly determined the legal issues. The respondent’s continued progress toward rehabilitation and recovery is commendable. However, even considering the new evidence submitted with the motion and the entire record, the Board finds no basis for reopening and remanding the case for further proceedings. The respondent’s equities were weighed against the respondent’s lengthy criminal history. The respondent’s motion does not meet his “heavy burden” to show that proffered new evidence would likely change the result in his case. See Matter of Coelho, supra. Prejudice from the claimed ineffectiveness of counsel has not been shown. See Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
The Board concludes that the final removal order in this matter is not subject to reopening, and the respondent’s motion will be denied
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and motion for a stay are denied. All other pending motions in this matter are denied as moot.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rusten C. Hurd, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on February 20, 2013, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status as a matter of discretion. In the prior decision, the Board affirmed this decision on de novo review. See Matter of Blas, 15 I&N Dec. 626 (BIA 1974); Matter of Arai, 13 I&N Dec. 494 (BIA 1970). Among the negative factors noted by the Immigration Judge and the Board was the respondent’s 2003 conviction for improper exhibition of a firearm, which stemmed from a 2001 arrest where he was charged by the police with an attempted home invasion robbery, shooting into an occupied dwelling, and use of a firearm during a felony.
 
In the motion, the respondent argues that his case should be reopened based on the ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney Nashid Sabir, who represented him before the Immigration Judge and the Board (the “former counsel”). The respondent argues that the former counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to submit to the Immigration Judge or the Board copies of the deposition transcripts of two witnesses in his criminal case that resulted in his 2003 conviction, even though he gave these documents to the former counsel before his hearing. The respondent argues that these documents show that these witnesses did not positively identify him as the person who was involved in the robbery attempt and shooting at the house of Lincoln Samuels, the victim. He suggests that these documents would have contradicted the police detective’s report submitted in his case (Exh. 6) and would have supported his contention that he was not the person involved in this incident.
 
However, the Immigration Judge and the Board are not in the position to relitigate the respondent’s criminal case leading to his 2003 conviction. Furthermore, the respondent does not deny in the motion, as the Board noted in the prior decision, that he has been arrested multiple times, although not all of the arrests resulted in criminal convictions. The respondent likewise does not deny that he actually pled no contest to a reduced charge of improper exhibition of a firearm, a first degree misdemeanor. In any event, while the respondent points out that the deposition transcripts of Arlene Frances McCormick indicated that she was not sure whether the gunman’s appearance matched that of a photograph shown to her (Motion, at 5-6; Motion Exh. C, at 16, 201), the police detective’s report showed that there were other witnesses who positively identified the respondent and provided sworn statements (Exh. 6). The respondent also points out that the deposition transcripts of Keino Samuels indicated that he had “no idea who did the shooting” (Motion, at 6; Motion Exh. D, at 28). However, both the police detective’s report and the deposition transcripts show that Keino Samuels was the victim’s younger son and he was in the bedroom in the house when the shooting occurred (Exh. 6; Motion Exh. D, at 27-28).
 
*2 Based on the above, we do not find that the former attorney’s failure to submit the deposition transcripts rendered his assistance “deficient to the point where the hearing was fundamentally unfair and [the respondent] was unable to reasonably present his case,” such that he was prejudiced by this failure. Dakane v. U.S. Attorney General, 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005). Since the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by the claimed ineffective assistance of counsel, we do not find that reopening is warranted based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Furthermore, even if we were to consider the documents submitted with the motion in determining whether the respondent should be granted adjustment of status as a matter of discretion, on de novo review we would not find that they would warrant a different outcome in the respondent’s case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michelle Mendez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
David Delgado
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On May 9, 2013, the respondent submitted this third, untimely motion to reopen his removal proceedings. The final administrative decision remains the Immigration Judge’s in absentia removal order of October 10, 2002. This motion is both untimely and number-barred. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent alleges that his prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance in the creation and submission of his second, untimely motion to reopen, filed with the Immigration Judge on May 11, 2010. He contends prior counsel’s representation was also deficient when appealing the denial of the motion to reopen to the Board, and while filing a motion to reconsider the subsequent Board dismissal. Finally, the respondent contends prior counsel erroneously charged him filing fees and pocketed the money, and failed to file applications and petitions with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) despite being paid to do so.
 
The respondent’s motion does not fall within any exception to the time and number limitations on motions to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(i)-(iv).
 
To the extent that the respondent alleges equitable tolling of the time and number limits is warranted, we are not persuaded that equitable tolling is warranted. See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir. 2008) (holding a request for “equitable tolling of a time- or number-barred motion to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is in essence an argument that the BIA should have exercised its discretion to reopen the proceeding sua sponte based upon the doctrine of equitable tolling”) (internal citations omitted); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (noting the Board’s discretionary authority to reopen sua sponte is reserved for rare, “exceptional” situations).
 
We note the untimely and number-barred nature of this motion does not appear related to the ineffective assistance in filing the second motion to reopen, the subsequent appeal, or the motion to reconsider.1
 
Additionally, the respondent has not established he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance rendered in this case. We understand the respondent’s concerns regarding the financial malfeasance alleged in this case, both with respect to the filing fees and the attorney’s failure to file applications and petitions before USCIS, but those allegations do not show the respondent suffered any prejudice within his removal proceedings. Insofar as the respondent alleges the second motion to reopen was “perfunctory and did not meet the standard of work product of a competent immigration attorney” (Motion at 7), we also conclude the respondent has not established he was prejudiced by the denial of the second motion. The respondent acknowledges that the motion was both untimely and number barred, and he has not proffered the additional arguments or evidence which should ostensibly have been presented to establish the motion fell within any exception to the time or number limits. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(i)-(iv).
 
*2 Upon examination of the evidence, arguments, and record in this case, we find no “exceptional” situation which would warrant exercise of our discretionary authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, supra. This motion will be denied as untimely and number-barred.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent’s first motion to reopen, submitted on December 2, 2009, was filed by a separate attorney who has not been accused of ineffective assistance. That motion, which alleged that the respondent had not received notice of his hearing of October 10, 2002, was denied by the Immigration Judge because the respondent had been personally served with the hearing notice contained on the Notice to Appear.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lisa Weissman-Ward, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Wayne H. Price
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)] - Conditional resident status terminated
 
Sec. 237(a)(3)(D)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(3)(D)(i)] - False claim of United States citizenship
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)] - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I)] - False claim of United States citizenship
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand; stay of removal
 
The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen her removal proceedings to challenge the removability charges under sections 237(a)(3)(D)(i) and (a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(3)(D)(i) and (a)(1)(A), and to have the Immigration Judge review the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ (“USCIS”) denial of her application for a hardship waiver under section 216(c)(4)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B). In our decision dated January 30, 2013, we dismissed her appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision which denied her motion to suppress and found her removable as charged above. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes her motion. The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen filed on April 29, 2013, is timely. She alleges ineffective assistance of former counsel (F. Woodside Wright). In Matter of Compean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General directed the Board to continue to apply the previously established standards for reviewing motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel (pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
The respondent meets the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to allege ineffective assistance of former counsel. She presents her declaration, counsel’s letter to Mr. Wright, and a copy of the complaint filed against Mr. Wright (Motion Exhs. at 55-89).
 
The respondent shows prejudice. See Lin v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir. 2004) (the court does not require that an alien’s representation be brilliant, but it cannot serve to make the immigration hearing so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case). She presents extensive evidence to support her contention that she entered into her first marriage in good faith (Motion Exhs. at 145-260). Mr. Wright, by not seeking review by the Immigration Judge of the USCIS’s denial of her second Form I-751 (application for a waiver under section 216(c)(4)(B) of the Act), prevented her from reasonably presenting her case. This may have affected the outcome of the case. See Correa-Rivera v. Holder, 706 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir. 2013) (the court will find prejudice when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings).
 
*2 The respondent also shows prejudice regarding the two removability charges she challenges. See Correa-Rivera v. Holder, supra. Section 237(a)(3)(D)(i) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that any alien who has falsely represented himself or herself to be a U.S. citizen for any purpose or benefit under this Act (including section 274A) or any Federal or State law is deportable. Section 212(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I), uses the same language except that the alien is “““inadmissible” instead of deportable. She presents evidence in support of her contention that stating that she was a U.S. citizen on her application for admission to the University of Nevada, Reno (Exhs. 2, 3), was not for any purpose or benefit under Nevada law (Motion Exhs. at 90-144). Mr. Wright did not present any evidence on this issue (other than in support of the motion to suppress). Her evidence may have affected the outcome of the case. We conclude that she shows prejudice under the standard in Correa-Rivera v. Holder, supra.1
 
Reopening and remand to the Immigration Judge are warranted because the respondent meets the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, and shows prejudice. Since her motion to reopen is timely filed, due diligence is not an issue. Because we will grant her motion, her stay request has been rendered moot.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Yesenia Polanco, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Melissa K. Metz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
On April 19, 2011, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States in absentia, because he failed to appear for his hearing. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on May 9, 2011, but that request was denied on May 10, 2011. The respondent has appealed from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the respondent was served with the Notice to Appear on January 6, 2011, in person. His counsel was notified by regular mail of the April 19, 2011, removal hearing, on February 15, 2011, by regular mail. There is no support for the statement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in its brief that the notice was mailed to both the respondent and to his attorney. The motion to reopen maintained that the respondent did not receive notice of the hearing. The respondent’s attorney asked that proceedings be reopened and the respondent be given an opportunity to apply for cancellation of removal or that a continuance be granted for his wife to be naturalized. The respondent noted that he has an approved Form I-130 filed by his now United States citizen wife, and that he is eligible to apply for cancellation of removal and for voluntary departure, in the alternative.
 
As correctly indicated in the Immigration Judge’s decision, a Notice of Hearing sent to an alien’s attorney of record is considered constructive notice to the alien. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c), 1292.5; Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 258 (BIA 1985). The respondent did not raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel to establish “exceptional circumstances” for his failure to appear at the hearing. The respondent also did not comply with the procedural requirements for filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as enunciated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741 (4th Cir. 2006) finding no compliance with Lozada), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1182 (2007). Accordingly, that issue is not before us.
 
*2 On appeal the respondent filed an affidavit from his wife stating that no notice of the hearing date for her husband came to their house by mail and that she and their two United States citizen children would suffer hardship, if he is removed. The respondent submitted an affidavit stating that he did not receive notice of the court date. The respondent’s attorney maintains in her affidavit that she did not receive notice of the hearing and that the hearing was not listed on the court’s telephonic calendar. She states that the Immigration Judge notified her in a phone conversation on the day of the hearing that the respondent had not appeared for his hearing, and subsequently the Immigration Judge issued an in absentia order of removal. She also alleges that his wife has naturalized and he is eligible for adjustment of status through consular processing.
 
We presume that a properly addressed notice sent via regular mail is received by the addressee. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). The burden of proof for rebutting that presumption is weaker when items are sent by regular mail as opposed to certified mail. See Matter of M-R-A-, supra. According to the record, the respondent’s counsel was sent a notice of the hearing and that notice was not returned. The respondent’s attorney did not give an explanation of the circumstances which might lead to a failure to deliver the notice and which led to the in absentia hearing. The respondent also did not demonstrate that he is eligible for new relief which was not available at the time of the hearing. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). He does not allege and it does not appear that he can adjust his status in the United States, even though his wife is a United States citizen. Section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). See Hussain v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 153, 156-57 (4th Cir. 2007). Therefore, the Immigration Judge correctly denied the motion. The Board is not authorized to grant the respondent a stay of removal beyond the time necessary to reach a decision on the motion. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d), 1003.2(f).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mun Su Park, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The appeal will be dismissed. The record reflects that the respondent, through counsel, waived appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5. On February 14, 2013, the respondent nonetheless filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) with the Board. While the respondent’s filing includes conclusory unsworn statements in English that he did not intelligently and voluntarily agree to voluntary departure and did not have a clear understanding of the consequences of voluntary departure,1 the respondent does not reference his counsel or comply with any of the requirements for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Moreover, this is not a case in which any ineffective assistance by counsel is apparent on the face of the record. Consequently, upon review, we find that this case is not properly before us. Thus, the Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal through counsel. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a)(1) (final sentence), 1003.39; Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

The sole relief for which the respondent appeared eligible at the January 15, 2013, hearing was voluntary departure, which the Government opposed. Under oath, the respondent requested to be considered for voluntary departure, which the Immigration Judge ultimately granted. We separately note that an appeal from a decision that grants the sole relief requested is subject to summary dismissal. See 8 C.F.R § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(C).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey B. Rubin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 26, 2013. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.1 On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent requests remand on the grounds that the conviction, which serves as the basis for removal, and which renders him ineligible for relief from removal, is being challenged before the criminal court pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).2 The respondent alleges that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his conviction, and he has filed a motion to vacate it. However, the conviction has not been vacated.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009). We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We conclude that good cause was not shown.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue the post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Removability and relief from removal are not at issue on appeal.

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel. See also Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. ___, 133 S.Ct. 1103 (2013) (holding that Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, which requires defense counsel to advise a defendant about the risk of deportation arising from a guilty plea, does not apply retroactively).

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Olusegun Asekun, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brandi M. Lohr
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Kenya, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s February 7, 2013, written decision which denied his second motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief in opposition. The appeal will be dismissed.1
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues involving questions of law, judgment and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of her own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C).
 
The respondent received personal service on February 24, 2012, of the Notice to Appear which bears his signature (Exh. 1). After he was released from immigration custody, a copy of a hearing notice dated March 16, 2012, which scheduled his hearing for September 12, 2012, was mailed to him. He has conceded that he was aware of his September 12, 2012, hearing.
 
Following a hearing conducted in absentia on September 12, 2012, at which the respondent failed to appear, an Immigration Judge found him subject to removal as charged, determined that he had abandoned all potential applications for relief, and ordered him removed from the United States. See generally section 240 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. The in absentia removal order was mailed to the respondent and it was not returned by the postal service.
 
On October 5, 2012, the respondent, through attorney Sanjay Mathur, filed a motion to reopen which alleged that he had forgotten to appear on September 12, 2012, although his counsel had instructed him to appear unless a motion to change venue from Buffalo to Dallas, Texas had been granted. Attached to the motion was a signed and sworn 2-page affidavit from the respondent dated September 28, 2012, which indicated that he had consulted with Mr. Mathur in March 2012, that he formally retained him in August 2012, and that he forgot to appear for his hearing on September 12, 2012.
 
*2 On October 29, 2012, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen because the respondent’s failure to appear based on forgetting his hearing did not constitute an exceptional circumstance. He also declined to reopen the respondent’s case on his own authority. The respondent did not appeal this decision and it is now final.
 
On December 26, 2012, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a second motion to reopen. He now alleged that his previous attorney had falsely informed him that he had filed a motion to change venue. The respondent also submitted an affidavit dated December 16, 2012, in which he alleged that Mr. Mathur told him he had filed a motion to change venue. Respondent believed he did not need to appear in Buffalo on September 12, 2012. The respondent alleged that after he signed the affidavit on September 28, 2012, Mr. Mathur changed the text on the first page to indicate that Mr. Mathur had instructed him of the necessity of appearing on September 12, 2012, but that he failed to appear for his hearing because he had forgotten his attorney’s instructions. He attached a copy of a bar complaint he filed with state authorities on December 10, 2012, along with a copy of his retainer agreement with Mr. Mathur dated August 14, 2012.
 
The DHS filed a response in opposition, noting that it was the respondent’s second motion to reopen which was number barred, that he only filed a bar complaint after the denial of his first motion, and that he had not provided Mr. Mathur with an opportunity to respond to the bar complaint prior to filing the motion to reopen because he filed the motion very soon after filing the bar complaint.
 
On February 7, 2013, the Immigration Judge denied the second motion to reopen because the alleged ineffective assistance of his prior attorney was not newly discovered evidence insofar as it existed at the time the respondent filed the first motion, he failed to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his first motion, which meant that it was a final order, and he was limited to one motion to reopen.
 
We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision.2 The respondent has failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to establish ineffective assistance of counsel because he has not indicated whether a response has been received by Mr. Mathur or whether he has declined to respond. Furthermore, he conceded that he was aware of his obligation to attend the September 2012 hearing and he has not alleged in his second affidavit that Mr. Mathur told him not to attend the hearing. Therefore, he has not established ineffective assistance on this record.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Musto
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)] - Entered U.S. without inspection
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 18, 2011, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen deportation proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was granted voluntary departure in lieu of deportation on January 10, 1997, and waived appeal (I.J. at 1). On April 3, 1997, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge based on ineffective assistance of counsel, which was denied on April 22, 1997. The respondent appealed the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion and the Board dismissed his appeal on December 14, 2001, finding he did not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and he did not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s alleged errors (BIA at 1-2). The respondent filed the present motion on March 15, 2011 with the Immigration Judge, alleging the same basis for reopening: namely, ineffective assistance of counsel of his first attorney as well as the attorney who filed an appeal with the Board and a subsequent attorney who was allegedly retained approximately 7 years after the respondent was ordered deported.
 
The respondent does not dispute the fact that his motion is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (a motion to reopen any case previously the subject of a final administrative order must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision). Rather, the respondent argues that his untimely filing should be equitably tolled because he received ineffective assistance of former counsel(s). But to benefit from equitable tolling, a respondent must show that he exercised due diligence and that he could not have reasonably been expected to file his motion earlier. See El-Gazawy v. Holder, 690 F.3d 852, 859 (7th Cir. 2012); Johnson v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 795, 799 (7th Cir. 2007) (stating that “[i]t is a rare occasion that we reverse a decision on the basis that a time limit should have been equitably tolled . . . it must be shown that the claimant could not have been expected to file earlier.”).
 
*2 Assuming that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated that equitable tolling applies, as he has not shown due diligence in pursuing his claim (I.J. at 2). As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent was aware of the possibility of ineffective assistance, as his second attorney raised this issue in her brief before the Board in August 1997 (I.J. at 2). The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal in 2001, and the respondent has offered no reasonable explanation for waiting more than 9 years from the date of the Board’s final decision in this case to file the present motion. Thus, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated that he acted with due diligence in pursuing his alleged ineffective assistance of counsel claim.1
 
The record reflects that the respondent is the beneficiary of an approved visa petition, has been married to a United States citizen since January 1997, and has a child with his wife (Respondent’s March 15, 2011 Motion, tabs A, C, D). Moreover, the respondent has submitted medical records that indicate that he has been diagnosed with serious cardiovascular issues (Respondent’s March 15, 2011 Motion, tab U). To the extent that the respondent requests sua sponte reopening to apply for adjustment of status based on exceptional circumstances, we note that becoming eligible for relief from deportation after a final administrative order has been entered, as the respondent has done, is common and does not, in itself, constitute an exceptional circumstance warranting our consideration of an untimely motion. To hold otherwise would vitiate the statutory and regulatory deadlines, which are designed to bring finality to immigration proceedings. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992) (motions to reopen are especially disfavored in immigration proceedings because every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien).
 
Moreover, we note that even assuming the respondent presents exceptional circumstances, we would decline to exercise our sua sponte authority, as the record does not indicate that the respondent is statutorily eligible for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), as he conceded that he entered without inspection (Exh. 1; Tr. at 11-12). Section 245(a) of the Act. Moreover, the record also does not indicate that the respondent is statutorily eligible for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act, because although the respondent claims that he is grandfathered under section 245(i) of the Act, the I-130 in the record reflects a priority date of July 5, 2009, and no other visa petition appears in the administrative record (Respondent’s March 15, 2011 Motion at tabs B & E). See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.10(a)(1), (3). As such, we conclude that the circumstances that the respondent described would not warrant reopening on a sua sponte basis. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We note that although the respondent alleges that the Immigration Judge in the original proceedings gave the respondent’s first attorney “““misleading directions” as to where to file the visa petition (Form I-130) (Respondent’s Br. at 2), a review of the transcript reveals that this assertion is without merit (Tr. at 13-15).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marcela Gyires, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Patricia B. Kelly Le Bienvenu
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; termination of proceedings
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Canada, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 26, 2012. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and found her ineligible for relief from removal based on her criminal convictions.1 On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance and denial of a request to terminate removal proceedings. The record will be remanded.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Before the Immigration Judge, the respondent requested continuances to enable her to challenge her criminal convictions before the criminal court pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010)2 and to pursue termination of proceedings through prosecutorial discretion by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Immigration Judge granted continuances from May 19, 2011, until January 26, 2012, but declined to grant a further continuance. The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying a further continuance. However, the respondent does not indicate whether the convictions have been vacated.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).3 We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We conclude that good cause was not shown. While the respondent is free to pursue a collateral attack on the convictions, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). A post-conviction motion to vacate convictions does not render the convictions non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Also at the January 26, 2012, hearing, the respondent requested termination of proceedings to pursue naturalization. The Immigration Judge denied that request. The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying the motion to terminate proceedings to allow the respondent to naturalize. She argues that she is in a regulatory catch-22, because the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a part of the DHS, will not adjudicate her naturalization application while she is in removal proceedings, and the Immigration Judge will not terminate proceedings without an acknowledgment of facie eligibility for naturalization from the USCIS. The DHS responds that the Immigration Judge cannot terminate proceedings without an affirmative communication of prima facie eligibility from the USCIS and that neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board can compel the USCIS to respond to a request for such an affirmative communication. The DHS also points out that the respondent submitted the request for acknowledgment of prima facie eligibility for naturalization to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), also a part of DHS, instead of USCIS, and the request was made only a few days before the scheduled hearing.
 
The Board of Immigration Appeals and Immigration Judges lack jurisdiction to adjudicate applications for naturalization. In order to pursue naturalization, the respondent must file a Form N-400, along with all relevant evidence, with the USCIS. Generally, an Immigration Judge cannot terminate proceedings to allow an alien to pursue that process. An Immigration Judge can only terminate proceedings when an alien has “established prima facie eligibility for naturalization” and the matter “involves exceptionally appealing or humanitarian factors.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1239.2(f). We decline to reach the respondent’s argument that we should revisit our holding in Matter of Acosta-Hidalgo, 24 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2007), in this case where the Immigration Judge has not addressed whether the respondent’s case “involves exceptionally appealing or humanitarian factors.” We find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge to address, in the first instance, whether the “““exceptionally appealing or humanitarian factors” prong of § 1239.2(f) is satisfied.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and entry of a new decision.

Removability and relief from removal are not at issue on appeal.

2

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel. See also Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. ___, 133 S.Ct. 1103 (2013) (holding that Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, which requires defense counsel to advise a defendant about the risk of deportation arising from a guilty plea, does not apply retroactively).

3

In determining whether good cause exists to continue removal proceedings, a variety of factors may be considered, including, but not limited to: the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the motion to continue and the reason for the continuance and any other relevant procedural factors. See Matter of Hashmi, supra.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margaret M. Price
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed an Immigration Judge’s January 24, 2012, decision which granted the respondent “pre-conclusion” voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). The respondent now maintains that she was provided ineffective assistance of counsel and requests a remand. The appeal will be dismissed.1
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error; but we review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals before us, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
To be eligible for pre-conclusion voluntary departure, a respondent must concede removability and waive any right to appeal that decision. Section 240B(a) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D); see also Matter of Ocampo, 22 I&N Dec. 1301 (BIA 2000).
 
The respondent’s removability is not in dispute. The Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure in lieu of having a full hearing on the merits, as the respondent indicated that she understood and sought this form of relief (Tr. at 12-13). Although the respondent may have been uncertain, at first, about the requirements to obtain this form of voluntary departure, she then specifically indicated that she was asking for this relief, accepted that the Immigration Judge’s decision would be final, and agreed to waive appeal (Tr. at 12-14). She stated that she understood that accepting the Immigration Judge’s decision meant she had to prepare to leave the country (Tr. at 13-14).
 
On appeal, the respondent now maintains that she wished to pursue other unstated relief. She avers that because of a fee dispute with her former attorney, the attorney improperly acceded to voluntary departure for the respondent in addition to waiving appeal. We note, however, that the respondent does not directly dispute that she, herself, agreed to depart voluntarily and to the appeal waiver (Tr. at 12-13). Although she asserts she does not speak English, she did not--and has not--objected to the translation which was provided at the hearing. In light of the respondent’s direct answers to the Immigration Judge on these issues, we find that the respondent’s waiver of appeal was knowing and intelligent.2 See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000).
 
*2 The respondent has also not attempted to explain in any meaningful detail the nature of her alleged dispute with her former attorney, including what the attorney agreed to do. While we recognize that the respondent is now appearing pro se, to successfully show ineffective assistance of counsel, she would need to specify the nature of her agreement with former counsel, describing in detail what representations counsel may have made. She would also generally be expected to file a complaint with the attorney’s licensing authority or explain why she has not done so. Additionally, the attorney must be afforded an opportunity to respond to her allegations. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent has not attempted to meet any of these criteria for showing ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, the respondent has not specified what other relief counsel was to have sought for her, nor whether she may actually be eligible for any other relief. Thus, she has not shown that she was prejudiced by her former counsel’s actions. See, e.g., Ochieng v. Mukasey, 520 F.3d 1110, 1115 (10th Cir. 2008) (showing of prejudice necessary to succeed on ineffective assistance of counsel claim). Consequently, remanding the record would serve no apparent purpose.
 
In light of the foregoing, the Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of her right to appeal. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a)(1) (final sentence), 1003.39 (finality of order); Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, supra; Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). As the respondent waived appeal, we have no further jurisdiction in this matter. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marilyn Labrada Dume, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, mailed August 24, 2012, denying her timely motion to reopen. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent seeks to reopen these removal proceedings to pursue an application for adjustment of status of status under section 245(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion because she has not demonstrated that she is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status (I.J. at 1). See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Sevoian v. Ashcroft, 290 F.3d 166, 170, 174 (3d Cir. 2002). In particular, the respondent has not demonstrated that she is a “grandfathered alien” for purposes of section 245(i) of the Act. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.10(a)(1)(i).
 
The respondent has presented evidence that her biological father was admitted to this country as an “F-24” lawful permanent resident (unmarried son or daughter (21 years of age or older) of a lawful permanent resident alien) in 1992 (Respondent’s Motion at 6, 9). See United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Adjudicator’s Field Manual, Appendix 23-7: Class of Admission under the Immigrant Laws, available online at http:// www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/AFM/HTML/AFM/0-0-0-1.html. While not clear, the admission of the respondent’s biological father as an F-24 in 1992 tends to indicate that he was the beneficiary of an immigrant visa petition filed on or before April 30, 2001. However, the respondent has not demonstrated that, within the meaning of section 101(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1), she was considered a derivative beneficiary “child” of the immigrant visa petition. For example, she does not claim that she was born in wedlock, legitimated in accordance with Dominican law, or, prior to her 21st birthday, shared a bona fide father / child relationship with her biological father. See sections 101(b)(1)(A), (C), (D) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(d)(2); Matter of Cabrera, 21 I&N Dec. 589, 591-92 (1996) (“Thus, a child residing or domiciled in the Dominican Republic may qualify as a legitimated child under section 101(b)(1)(C) [of the Act] as soon as his father acknowledges paternity in accordance with Dominican law.”); Matter of Vizcaino, 19 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1988); Matter of Annang, 14 I&N Dec. 502 (BIA 1973) (holding that the content of foreign law is a question of fact that must be proven by the party relying on it).
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent claims that the attorney who represented her before the Immigration Judge provided her with ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to address her eligibility for adjustment of status, we observe that the respondent has not complied with the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), nor established that she was prejudiced by her former counsel’s handling of this matter. Accordingly, we will not disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. The following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Kathleen L. Torres
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the February 21, 2012, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely. An Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States, on October 7, 2011. The respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen on February 3, 2012, but he raised claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and equitable tolling. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen as untimely without addressing either of these issues. We find a remand is warranted to allow the Immigration Judge to address the issues of ineffective assistance of counsel and equitable tolling in light of applicable case law and determine if the 90-day deadline should be equitably tolled. Accordingly, the record will be remanded for further proceedings and the entry of a new decision.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings and the entry of a new decision consistent with the foregoing opinion.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John David Mansfield, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
J.L. Woodmansee
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on April 11, 2002, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider and reopen. On April 15, 2013, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order entered against him. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a brief opposing the respondent’s motion, and, on June 3, 2013, the respondent filed a response to the Department of Homeland Security’s opposition. The respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind will be denied.
  
I. MOTION TO RESCIND
 
Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), states that an in absentia order may be rescinded “upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (e)(1)).”1 The Immigration Judge entered an in absentia order of removal against the respondent on October 11, 2000. The respondent, however, did not file his current motion to rescind until 12 ½ years later. The respondent’s motion to rescind based on exceptional circumstances therefore is untimely.
 
In addition, the regulations pertaining to the filing of motions to rescind in absentia orders entered in removal proceedings state that an alien may only file one motion to rescind. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent filed a motion to rescind with the Immigration Judge on January 8, 2001. The Immigration Judge denied this motion on February 26, 2001, and we upheld the Immigration Judge’s decision on August 22, 2001. The respondent’s current motion to rescind therefore is the respondent’s second motion of this type and is numerically barred.
 
The respondent claims in his motion that the time and numeric limits for filing motions to rescind should be equitably tolled because he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. He contends that his first attorney, Thomas Mix, did not remind him of his hearing on October 11, 2000, and therefore was responsible for his failure to appear. The respondent also contends that his attempts to rectify and explain this situation were compromised by the ineffective representation of his subsequent attorney, Manuel Gonzalez. The respondent has submitted copies of complaints that he claims to have filed against each of these attorneys with the relevant disciplinary authorities. The respondent also has submitted a declaration and a supplemental declaration, documentation pertaining to his eligibility for adjustment of status, and the prior rulings in his case.
 
*2 The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the circuit in which the respondent’s case arises, has held that equitable tolling of the time limit for a motion to reopen is available “when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error.” See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir. 2003); see also Fajardo v. INS, 300 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2002) (stating that the 180-day deadline for filing a motion to rescind an in absentia order based on a claim of exceptional circumstances can be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance of an attorney or a non-attorney). The Ninth Circuit further has indicated that it considered three issues in determining whether an alien exercised due diligence: (1) if and when a reasonable person in the alien’s position would suspect the specific fraud or error underlying her petition, (2) whether the alien took reasonable steps to investigate the suspected fraud or error or, if the alien was unaware of the error, to pursue relief, and (3) when the alien definitively learned of the harm resulting from counsel’s deficiency. Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 680 (9th Cir. 2011).
 
In this case, the respondent has not presented sufficient evidence to establish that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the time or numeric limits on his motion to rescind. In particular, the respondent has not met the procedural requirements necessary for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not presented sufficient evidence to establish that ineffective assistance of counsel caused the entry of the in absentia order against him or prevented him from obtaining rescission, and he has not established that he has acted diligently in discovering any ineffective assistance or in pursuing relief.
  
A. Matter of Lozada Requirements
 
To obtain reopening on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must meet certain procedural requirements. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). These requirements also are applicable to the respondent’s situation. Cf. Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec 472 (BIA 1996) (finding that, under former statute, alien met exceptional circumstances requirement when he established that his failure to appear was due to ineffective assistance of counsel). The respondent, however, has not met these requirements for either of his former attorneys.
 
The respondent has discussed his arrangement with Mr. Mix in the declaration he submitted with his motion, and he has submitted a bar complaint against Mr. Mix which he claims to have filed with the relevant authorities. Nevertheless, the respondent has not offered evidence to establish that he has notified Mr. Mix of the charges against him or explained why he is unable to do so.2
 
*3 Further, the respondent has not presented an affidavit setting forth his agreement with his second attorney, Mr. Gonzalez. The bar complaint the respondent claims to have filed against Mr. Gonzalez contains vague statements regarding their agreement, and the record contains an entry of appearance Mr. Gonzalez filed with the DHS in 2006, but this information is not sufficient to establish that the respondent retained Mr. Gonzalez to represent him for any purpose before the immigration courts or this Board. See, e.g., Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding that erroneous advice received outside and in advance of immigration proceedings did not affect fairness of proceedings and did not provide basis for reopening due to ineffective assistance of counsel); cf. Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893, 896 (9th Cir. 2008) (finding attorney-client arrangement evident from on the record appearances). In addition, the respondent has not presented evidence to indicate that he has attempted to notify Mr. Gonzalez of the charges he is making against him.3 The respondent therefore has not submitted sufficient evidence to establish that he has met the procedural requirements necessary to make a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
  
B. Ineffective Assistance
 
Moreover, even if we were to conclude that the respondent has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, supra, the respondent has not submitted sufficient evidence to establish that the ineffective assistance of his former attorneys led to the entry of the in absentia order or his inability to obtain rescission of this order. The respondent now claims that he did not appear at his hearing on October 11, 2000, because Mr Mix’s office did not remind him of his hearing date.4 This claim, however, conflicts with the statement he submitted with a motion to reopen and reconsider filed with this Board on October 9, 2001. In that statement, the respondent said that he did not appear because he mistakenly believed that his hearing was the following week and his father did not remind him of the correct hearing date until it was too late for him to appear in court.
 
The respondent has attempted to explain the discrepancies in his statements by submitting an additional declaration. See Respondent’s Reply to DHS’ Opposition to Respondent’s Motion To Reopen Removal Proceedings. In this most recent statement, the respondent claims that he did not read the statement that Mr. Mix’ assistant gave him to sign in 2001, and he appears to allege that the assistant was trying to shift the blame for respondent’s non-appearance from herself to the respondent’s father.
 
Even if we accept the respondent’s most recent statement as true, the record shows that the respondent received both oral and written notice of his hearing date and of the consequences for failing to appear from the Immigration Judge (I.J. 2/26/01 at 6). The respondent therefore had sufficient information to allow him to appear in court as required, and he bears some responsibility for not appearing or for not contacting his attorney to ask if he was required to appear. The information of record is not sufficient to establish that the oversight or error of Mr Mix’s office amounted to ineffective assistance.
 
*4 In addition, the respondent has not provided sufficient information regarding the duties Mr. Gonzalez owed to him to establish that any errors on the part of Mr. Gonzalez constituted ineffective assistance. The bar complaints the respondent has prepared against Mr. Mix and Mr. Gonzalez indicate that the respondent only worked with Mr. Gonzalez from 2006 to 2007, and they do not contain sufficient information to establish what Mr. Gonzalez was supposed to accomplish for the respondent during that time. The respondent therefore has not met his burden of establishing that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel in his immigration proceedings.
  
C. Due Diligence
 
Finally, even if we were to conclude that the respondent had met the Lozada requirements and established that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel that affected the outcome of his proceedings, the respondent has not addressed the issue of due diligence in his motion. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra (indicating that, to obtain equitable tolling of a filing deadline, an alien must act with due diligence in discovering the fraud or error that led to missing the deadline). The respondent states in his March 11, 2013, declaration that Mr. Mix called him on October 11, 2000, after he failed to appear for the hearing, but he does not state what steps he then took to address the alleged error on the part of this attorney or to pursue relief. Further, the record shows that Mr. Mix filed a motion to rescind with the Immigration Judge on January 9, 2001, and that the Immigration Judge denied the motion on February 26, 2001. Mr. Mix appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision and then filed a motion to reconsider with this Board. The documents that Mr. Mix submitted to the Immigration Judge and this Board indicated that the respondent had failed to appear due to a mistake on the respondent’s part. At some point during this process, the respondent should have become aware of the representations Mr. Mix was making on his behalf. The respondent, however, has not explained adequately why he waited until 2013 to file a motion to rescind based on the ineffective assistance of Mr. Mix and Mr. Gonzalez. The respondent therefore has not met his burden of establishing that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the deadline for filing a motion to rescind based on exceptional circumstances.
  
II. SUA SPONTE REOPENING
 
We further find that the respondent has not presented sufficient evidence to establish that reopening pursuant to our sua sponte authority is appropriate. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that our discretion to reopen sua sponte is limited to cases where exceptional circumstances are demonstrated). Due to the passage of time, the respondent now is eligible for an exception to the inadmissibility ground contained in section 212(a)(9)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(C)(i). See section 212(a)(9)(C)(ii) of the Act. The respondent, however, has not established that the Secretary of Homeland Security has consented to his reapplying for admission. Id. The respondent therefore remains statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status, the relief he is seeking in reopened proceedings, and reopening to allow him to pursue this relief is not warranted. Cf. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-73 (BIA 1992) (indicating that motions to reopen are disfavored and that this Board may deny reopening when an alien has not established prima facie eligibility for the relief he is seeking). We therefore decline to reopen the respondent’s proceedings pursuant to our sua sponte authority.
 
*5 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind is denied.

Section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act also states that an in absentia order may be rescinded at any time if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive proper notice of his hearing. The respondent has not claimed a lack of notice, and the Immigration Judge found that the respondent received both oral and written notice of the hearing at which he failed to appear (I.J. 2/26/01 at 6).

2

The respondent does state in the bar complaint he claims to have filed against Mr. Gonzalez that Mr. Mix became ill in 2006. The respondent, however, has not offered any other information about Mr. Mix’s situation and has not indicated that illness or other circumstances have prevented him from notifying Mr. Mix of the charges.

3

Our records indicate that Mr. Gonzalez was suspended from appearing before the Board and the immigration courts for 60 days as of June 15, 2011. The respondent therefore might not need to satisfy the notice requirement set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, supra.

4

The respondent’s statement signed on March 11, 2013, and submitted with his current motion also contains internal inconsistencies. The respondent first states that he did not receive a call from his former attorney’s office to remind him of his hearing and he completely forgot about the hearing due to the stress he was under at the time. The respondent then states that, because he did not receive a reminder, he reasoned that his hearing must have been for a later date. This second statement implies that the respondent did, in fact, remember his hearing but did not appear because he did not receive a call from his attorney.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeffrey T. Bubier
Senior Attorney
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen filed on April 29, 2013, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), will be denied.
 
The Board issued a final order in this case on November 26, 2012, and denied a motion to reopen on April 8, 2013. The pending motion is untimely and barred by numerical limitations for motions to reopen. Sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A) & (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The Board could only reopen proceedings under its sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(a). This action is taken only in “exceptional situations”, which are not presented here. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
The respondent was convicted in 2011 of possession with intent to deliver marijuana. The respondent contends that this conviction is not final. He attaches a “Pre-Trial Order of Court-Criminal”, which suggests that the respondent’s appellate rights were reinstated in that case. However, the respondent argued before the Immigration Judge that he was appealing that conviction (Tr. at 7). As the Immigration Judge properly considered, the respondent was nevertheless also convicted in March, 2000, for delivery or possession with intent to deliver cocaine, a drug trafficking aggravated felony (Tr. at 7-8). See also I.J. at 2; DHS Opp.; section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act.
 
The respondent also argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel concerning criminal cases, and cites Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010). The ruling in Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, does not change the finality of a conviction for immigration purposes, unless and until it is overturned by a criminal court. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154, 156-67 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996). Moreover, the Supreme Court has concluded that Padilla is not entitled to retroactive application. See Chaidez v. United States, 133 S.Ct. 1103 (2013).
 
The respondent also argues that he did not receive “timely notice of the dismissal decision” from the Board. Yet the Board promptly mailed both of its prior decisions to the respondent at the address where he is still located, and the decisions were not returned as undeliverable.
 
*2 The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied, and the request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hakeem Ishola, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jaime Diaz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(D)(i)] - Failure to appear for an interview to remove conditional basis of alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence on a conditional basis
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; stay of removal
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 31, 2010. In his decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) filed a motion for summary affirmance. The appeal will be dismissed, and the stay will be denied.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). The respondent’s case is not governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act. See Matter of S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 42 (BIA 2006).
 
The procedural history in the present case is as follows. The respondent was served with an Order to Show Cause (Form I-862) on May 29, 1992 (Exh. 1). On June 8, 1993, a Notice of Hearing was mailed via certified mail to the address the respondent provided to the government upon his release from detention. The Notice of Hearing informed the respondent that his hearing was scheduled for July 29, 1993 (Exh. 2). The respondent’s sister signed the domestic return receipt on June 9, 1993 (Exh. 2). On July 27, 1993, the respondent filed a change of address form and a letter requesting postponement of his hearing date and a change of venue to Salt Lake City, Utah (Exh. 2A). On August 2, 1993, the Immigration Judge issued a decision denying the respondent’s request for a continuance and to change venue. She further ordered the respondent deported in absentia.
 
On October 26, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to rescind his in absentia deportation order. In it, he alleged lack of notice and exceptional circumstances in that he received ineffective assistance from a notario who held himself out to be a lawyer. The DHS filed a memorandum in opposition. On March 31, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. He concluded the respondent received proper notice of his hearing. Regarding the “exceptional circumstances” issue, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent’s motion was untimely and that the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the “Fifth Circuit”) does not recognize the doctrine of equitable tolling in such circumstances. The respondent timely appealed to this Board.
 
*2 We concur with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. Contrary to the respondent’s assertion on appeal, the Immigration Judge properly applied section 242B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b, to the respondent’s motion to reopen because the applicable Notice of Hearing was issued on or about June 8, 1993, approximately 1 year after section 242B of the Act became effective (Resp.’s Br. at 2-3; Exh. 2). See Magdaleno de Morales v. INS, 116 F.3d 145, fn. 4 (5th Cir. 1997) (The amended statute applies if notice of the hearing was provided after June 13, 1992); see also Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I & N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993); Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, fn. 2 (BIA 1996) (Section 242B of the Act applies to a deportation hearing where notice of the scheduled hearing date is issued on or after June 13, 1992).
 
Moreover, notwithstanding the respondent’s assertions to the contrary, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the respondent received proper notice of his deportation hearing (Resp.’s Br. at 8-11). See generally Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27, 32 (BIA 1995) (discussing notice requirements for Orders to Show Cause (OSC) governed by section 242B of the Act). Nor do we find clear error in the factual findings leading up to that determination. The respondent’s Notice of Hearing was mailed via certified mail to the address he provided to the government upon his release from detention, and his sister signed the domestic return receipt. See generally Maknojiya v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 588, 589 (5th Cir. 2005) (when the notice is sent by certified mail through the United States Postal Service and there is proof of attempted delivery and notification of certified mail, a strong presumption of effective service arises that may be overcome only by the affirmative defense of nondelivery or improper delivery by the Postal Service); see also Matter of Grijalva, supra, and Matter of M-D-, 23 I&N Dec. 540 (BIA 2002). The respondent did not file his change of address form until after the notice of hearing was mailed to him, and he clearly had notice of his hearing because he acknowledged the date of his hearing in his request for a continuance and to change venue (Exh. 2A). We disagree with the respondent’s assertion that the Immigration Judge should have delayed proceedings and issued a new notice of hearing to the respondent’s new address, especially since the respondent did not file such request until 2 days before his scheduled hearing (Resp.’s Br. at 11).
 
*3 The respondent also received proper notice advising him of the consequences of his failure to appear (Resp.’s Br. at 11-14).1 Both the respondent’s Order to Show Cause and the Change of Address Form (Form EOIR-33) he received upon release from detention contained this information (Exh. 1). There is no requirement that the advisals be made orally or in person (Resp.’s Br. at 11-14). Thus, the respondent was properly advised of the consequences of failing to appear.
 
Additionally, we disagree with the respondent’s assertion that his request for continuance and change of venue filed 2 days before his hearing vitiates his in absentia hearing (Resp.’s Br. at 12-14). The respondent’s request for continuance and change of venue did not relieve him of his obligation to attend his deportation hearing. Until the respondent’s request for continuance and change of venue was decided, he was required to attend his scheduled hearing in El Paso. See Magdaleno de Morales v. INS, supra; see also Patel v. US INS, 803 F.2d 804, 806 (5th Cir. 1986) (the mere submission of a motion for continuance does not relieve an alien or his counsel of the obligation to appear for a noticed hearing). As the Immigration Judge properly determined in her in absentia order, the respondent chose to move from El Paso, was aware of his scheduled hearing, and chose not to appear (I.J. order dated 08/02/93 at 4). Patel v. US INS, supra. The Immigration Judge’s in absentia order was proper.
 
We further disagree with the respondent’s assertion that his case should be reopened based on exceptional circumstances, in that his notario, who he claims falsely held himself out to be an attorney, improperly told him that he did not need to attend his deportation hearing (Resp.’s Br. at 15-24). Former section 242B(c)(3) of the Act provides that an in absentia order will be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days of the order if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances. We do not agree with the respondent’s assertion that his notario’s incorrect advice constituted an exceptional circumstance. However, even if we did, the respondent waited more than 16 years to file his motion to reopen. Therefore, his motion is untimely. See section 242B(c)(3) of the Act.
 
The respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge erred by not equitably tolling the 180-day deadline (Resp.’s Br. at 18, 24-25). We disagree. The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the Fifth Circuit has not adopted the doctrine of equitable tolling in this context. See generally Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 218 (5th Cir. 2008). We further find insufficient reason to reopen the respondent’s case pursuant to our sua sponte discretionary authority. Id. (alien assertion that he was entitled to equitable tolling of the time and number limitations that applied to motions to reopen because of ineffective assistance of counsel was equivalent to claim that the Board should have exercised its sua sponte discretion to reopen); see also Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948 (5th Cir. 2012); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
*4 Turning to the respondent’s request to reopen deportation proceedings to pursue suspension of deportation, we disagree with his assertion that he is eligible for suspension of deportation under former section 244 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254, in accordance with our holding in Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998), despite the fact that he did not receive oral warning for the consequences of failing to appear for a deportation proceeding (Resp.’s Br. at 25-27). In that regard, we have recently held that the 90-day time limitation for filing a motion to reopen in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) applies to motions to reopen in absentia deportation orders, whether filed before or after the 1996 promulgation of the regulations; we further held that the 5-year limitation on discretionary relief for failure to appear at deportation proceedings under former section 242B(e)(1) of the Act is not in conflict with, and does not provide an exception to, the 90-day deadline for filing a motion to reopen in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). See Matter of Monges-Garcia, 25 I&N Dec. 246 (BIA 2010). As previously noted, the respondent waited more than 16 years to file his motion to reopen. Therefore, his motion is untimely. Id.; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
Finally, we decline to reopen the respondent’s proceedings for “repapering” (Resp.’s Br. at 30-32). Repapering is not within our authority and is not warranted in any event in part for reasons that sua sponte reopening is not warranted.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed, and his stay is denied.

The respondent cites Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001), to support his assertion that he did not receive proper notice advising him of the consequences of failing to appear. We note that Matter of G-Y-R- applies to removal proceedings whereas the respondent is in deportation proceedings. However, even if we applied the reasoning contained in Matter of G-Y-R- to the facts contained in the present case, it would not alter the outcome of the case.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jason A. Flora, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William A. Lund
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 5, 2012, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on October 18, 2011. On appeal, the respondent concedes that he received legally sufficient notice of his hearing, as notice was served on his attorney of record, but contends that his failure to appear was due to established exceptional circumstances, the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen for failure to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (I.J. at 3). The respondent cites to decisions from the United States Court of Appeals for the First and Ninth Circuits in support of his assertion that the proceedings should be reopened despite his failure to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. However, such case law is not controlling in the instant matter, which arises in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit; rather, Lozada continues to be controlling. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not met the evidentiary requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and he has failed to establish “exceptional circumstances” for his failure to appear (I.J. at 3). See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996) (holding that an alien seeking to reopen in absentia deportation proceedings based on her unsuccessful communications with her attorney and her alleged non-receipt of notification from her attorney regarding the hearing date did not establish “exceptional circumstances” where she failed to satisfy all of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim set out in Matter of Lozada, supra).
 
Furthermore, we are unpersuaded by the respondent’s assertion that the Immigration Judge erred in not allowing him to supplement his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel before denying his motion to reopen. We note that the motion did not indicate that the respondent intended to file any supplemental evidence, nor has such evidence been submitted on appeal.
 
*2 Finally, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in not reopening his proceedings sua sponte. However, we conclude that the respondent has not established that sua sponte reopening is warranted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Even accepting the respondent’s assertion that his former attorney did not provide him with actual notice of his hearing date, upon consideration of the record as a whole, we hold that he has presented insufficient evidence of circumstances that would justify a discretionary grant of his untimely motion to reopen and the extraordinary remedy of reopening his removal proceedings sua sponte. See, e.g., Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (sua sponte reopening is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Russell L. Marshak, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 15, 2012, denying his motion to reopen his proceeding.1 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the Immigration Judge’s determination of credibility. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The respondent was granted pre-conclusion voluntary departure on November 17, 2011. On February 14, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reopen to allow him to seek adjustment of status. The respondent contends that he would not have accepted voluntary departure if his former attorneys had informed him that he could adjust his status by continuing to take and by passing the English language test required for a visa in his field or by seeking a new Form I-140 in a non-healthcare-related field. Respondent’s application for adjustment of status has been denied three times for lack of a Visa Screen certification because he has not passed the English language exam. Respondent had not taken the test for several years before his hearing, and has not submitted any evidence that he has passed the exam. In making his apparent ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent has not substantially complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Singh v. Holder, 658 F.3d 879, 884 (9th Cir. 2011).
 
Even if, as the respondent contends, we found that the record sufficiently established the respondent’s claim for ineffective assistance without meeting the requirements of Matter of Lozada, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion as he has not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for the relief sought (I.J. at 3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); see also Lin v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir. 2004); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). The respondent has not presented an application for adjustment of status or an approved visa petition. The respondent’s claim that he could adjust his status through an, as yet unfiled, visa petition from a different employer is purely speculative and insufficient to warrant reopening his proceedings. We further reject the respondent’s contention that the Immigration Judge ignored the ““““primary basis” for his motion to reopen, that his lack of knowledge of his ““““alternative rights and remedies” prevented him from providing a knowing and intelligent waiver of his appeal rights in accepting pre-conclusion voluntary departure (Br. at 17-19). See section 240B(a) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b). As the respondent was represented by counsel, this argument is properly construed as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as addressed by the Immigration Judge and in this order. Furthermore, as the respondent has not presented any evidence that he is eligible for relief under his “alternative rights and remedies,” we cannot conclude that his lack of information precluded a knowing and intelligent waiver.
 
*2 Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: MIGUEL A. MENDEZ-DURAN
File: AXXX XX7 004 - Portland, OR

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rachel Game, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sarah C. Schreck
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on December 17, 2012, when it dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s October 12, 2010, decision. At that time, we also declined to reinstate the 60-day period of voluntary departure that the Immigration Judge had granted because the respondent did not present proof of payment of the voluntary departure bond within 30 days of filing the appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3)(ii). On March 18, 2013, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent claims that he paid the $500 voluntary departure bond on October 13, 2010, and that his former attorney, who has resigned from the practice of law for disciplinary reasons, rendered ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to advise the respondent of the need to submit proof of payment of the bond to the Board with the Notice of Appeal. The Department of Homeland Security does not oppose reopening the proceedings for the limited purpose of reinstating the grant of voluntary departure. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g). The motion will be granted.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted for the limited purpose of reinstating voluntary departure.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
*2 WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kyle D. Brown, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Richard I. Newman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 12, 2011, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On May 4, 2011, the Immigration Judge entered an order granting the respondent the privilege of voluntarily departing the United States on or before September 1, 2011. On September 1, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge alleging ineffective assistance by his former counsel and requesting that proceedings be reopened to await adjudication of the U visa petition filed by his wife. On October 12, 2011, the Immigration Judge denied the motion as untimely and declined to exercise his sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings.
 
We are not persuaded that the Immigration Judge’s decision should be reversed. There is no dispute that the respondent’s motion to reopen, which was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge entered his final administrative order, is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1299a(c)(7)(C)(i); see also Matter of Goolcharan, 23 I&N Dec. 5, 8 (BIA 2001) (noting that the date on which a period of voluntary departure expires is inconsequential to the timely filing of a motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge). Moreover, the respondent does not assert that his motion falls within any of the exceptions to the filing deadlines for motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4). Rather, he argues that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled in light of his prior attorney’s ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Br. at 4-8). Alternatively, he argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not reopening proceedings sua sponte (Respondent’s Br. at 8-9).
 
To the extent the respondent requests equitable tolling of the filing deadline, we note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has not addressed in a published decision whether the motion time limitations may be equitably tolled in cases claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 219-220 (5th Cir. 2008) (holding that a request for equitable tolling of a time or number-barred motion to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is “in essence an argument that the BIA should have sua sponte reopened the proceeding based upon the doctrine of equitable tolling”). An alien seeking equitable tolling of a motion to reopen period based on ineffective assistance of counsel must affirmatively demonstrate how he acted with due diligence during the entire period he seeks to toll, and the respondent has not done so. See, e.g., Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127 (2d Cir. 2008); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006). According to the respondent’s affidavit, he raised the issue of his wife’s U visa with his former attorney prior to the May 4, 2011, hearing (Motion to Reopen, Tab 9). The respondent and his wife decided to file a new Form I-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status, on the day of the hearing, which they ultimately did on August 8, 2011 (Id.) The respondent has not explained why he waited more than 100 days after the Immigration Judge entered his decision to retain a new attorney or to seek reopening of his proceedings. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the respondent acted with due diligence during the time he seeks to toll.
 
*2 We note that even if the respondent had shown that he acted with due diligence, he has not sufficiently complied with the evidentiary requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). An alien seeking to establish ineffective assistance of counsel must (1) provide an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts, including a detailed description of the agreement with former counsel, (2) establish that former counsel has been informed of the allegations and provided with an opportunity to respond, and (3) indicate whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authority, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent has not complied with the second and third requirements. There is no evidence that the respondent’s prior attorney has been informed of the specific allegations being made against him or that he has been given an opportunity to respond. Additionally, the respondent has not indicated whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authority or explained why such a complaint has not been filed. Accordingly, the respondent has not established that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s appellate arguments that the Immigration Judge erred in declining to reopening proceedings sua sponte. Immigration Judges may exercise sua sponte authority to reopen in “truly exceptional situations” where the interests of justice would be served. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999). Proceedings will generally not be reopened sua sponte where an alien seeks to pursue relief over which the Board and the Immigration Judges have no jurisdiction. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2009) (declining to reopen and remand proceedings to allow an arriving alien to seek adjustment of status before USCIS). As the Immigration Judge noted, the USCIS has sole jurisdiction over all petitions for U nonimmigrant status. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1). Moreover, the entry of a final order of removal does not preclude the USCIS from adjudicating a petition, and the respondent may request a stay of removal with the USCIS pursuant to 8 CFR § 241.6(a). See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(f)(2)(ii). Accordingly, we will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Cathy A. Auble
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on March 19, 2013, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his request for a continuance and ordering him removed from the United States. On April 22, 2013, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief indicating that it does not oppose reopening in the respondent’s case. Accordingly, we grant the respondent’s motion to reopen, and we remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings regarding the respondent’s eligibility for voluntary departure and any other relief for which he might be eligible.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s unopposed motion to reopen is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Irina Kogan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s September 12, 2012, decision denying her request for a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent conceded that she is removable as charged under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i). Before the Immigration Judge, she did not dispute the fact of the conviction that forms the basis for her removability. However, the respondent contended that she received ineffective assistance of counsel in her state criminal proceedings because her lawyer did not advise her of the adverse immigration consequences that might result from pleading guilty. Accordingly, she sought post-conviction relief in state court based on Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010), and requested a continuance of her removal proceedings pending the state court’s decision.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent’s desire to await the outcome of her motion to vacate her 2007 New York state conviction for petty larceny did not amount to “good cause” for a continuance. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which was opposed to the respondent’s request for a continuance, issued the Notice to Appear in this matter on November 23, 2010 (I.J. at 1, 3; Exh. 1). The Immigration Judge continued these proceedings in March 2011, December 2011, June 2012, and July 2012 (I.J. at 3-4; Tr. at 12-13, 20, 25-26). The Immigration Judge gave the respondent a specific deadline by which to present evidence that she had filed a motion to vacate, but the respondent did not comply (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 13). Rather, she filed the motion to vacate her conviction on September 7, 2012, 5 days prior to her final hearing before the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 4). On appeal, the respondent asserts that she could not afford to file a motion earlier due to her recent legal expenses. See Resp. Brief at 2.
 
The likelihood of success on the respondent’s motion to vacate is speculative. Even though the respondent apparently is relying upon the 2010 decision in Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, in support of her claims to vacate her New York state conviction, the United States Supreme Court has recently determined that, with respect to federal convictions, the decision in Padilla does not apply retroactively. Chaidez v. United States, 133 S.Ct. 1103 (2013). Nonetheless, we acknowledge that there may be an independent and adequate ground under New York state law upon which the respondent may be able to pursue her post-conviction claims. See Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1040-1042 (1983).
 
*2 Overall, considering the significant amount of time that the respondent was provided to pursue her post-conviction relief claims, her lack of diligence in filing the motion to vacate, the DHS’s opposition to her request, and the speculative nature of post-conviction relief claims, we conclude that the respondent did not establish “good cause” for a further continuance of proceedings. See Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 815 (BIA 2012) (recognizing that an alien should not be granted a continuance “as a dilatory tactic to forestall the conclusion of removal proceedings”).
 
The respondent’s conviction evidently remains undisturbed, as she has yet to indicate that she has received a vacatur. Therefore, her conviction is valid for the purpose of these removal proceedings. Further, the continuing validity of the respondent’s conviction despite the passage of approximately 20 months since the Immigration Judge’s decision, is sufficient to establish that the denial of the respondent’s continuance request was not prejudicial, as it must be in order to constitute a due process violation. See Waldron v. INS, 17 F.3d 511 (2d Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1014 (1994).
 
The Immigration Judge was presented with a facially valid removal charge; even considering the humanitarian considerations present, he need not have adjourned removal proceedings pending the outcome of collateral criminal proceedings. In conclusion, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s request for a continuance and ordered her removed from the United States. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Kimani R. Eason
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 17, 2013. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. In this matter, we find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for preparation of a full decision setting forth the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999); Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994). In the new decision, the Immigration Judge should analyze the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008); Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001). Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision and for the entry of a new decision.

P. Michael Truman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on January 24, 2013, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and reinstated voluntary departure.1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and seeking reopening to apply for adjustment of status based upon his September 24, 2010, marriage to a United States citizen. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. Considering the totality of the circumstances presented, including the evidence submitted, we will grant the motion and remand the proceedings to provide the respondent a further opportunity to pursue relief. We do not express an opinion on the merits of the respondent’s entitlement to relief. On remand, the Immigration Judge may receive any additional evidence he deems appropriate to the full resolution of this matter. Accordingly, the motion will be granted.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings not inconsistent with this order.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mark Jebson
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen her removal proceedings, alleging she was the victim of ineffective assistance during her prior proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security opposes reopening. The motion will be denied.
 
The party requesting reopening bears the burden of establishing the existence of new, previously unavailable, and material evidence which would likely affect the outcome of the proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). If an alien alleges reopening is warranted due to ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien must establish that prior counsel’s conduct was deficient, must demonstrate that the deficiencies prejudiced the alien, and must substantially comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
We are not persuaded that reopening is warranted. The respondent’s motion does not substantially comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. Hamid v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 465, 469 (6th Cir. 2003). The respondent has not submitted any evidence regarding whether a complaint was filed with the appropriate disciplinary committee or whether prior counsel has been informed of these allegations. Additionally, the respondent has not submitted her own affidavit. Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980) (noting uncorroborated statements by counsel in a brief or motion do not constitute evidence). As the respondent’s motion does not comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, we do not address the claims that prior counsel’s conduct was deficient or that the respondent was prejudiced.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lisa A. Guerra, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kathy French Giraitis
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 30, 2013. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.1 On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On appeal, the respondent requests remand on the grounds that the conviction, which renders him ineligible for relief from removal, is being challenged before the criminal court pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).2 The respondent alleges that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his conviction, and he has filed a motion to vacate it. However, the conviction has not been vacated.
 
First, we note that the respondent did not request a continuance on the record. Consequently, the Immigration Judge did not rule on the request on the record or in his decision. Furthermore, while the respondent is free to pursue the post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

1

Respondent (through counsel) admitted the factual allegations in the Notice to Appear and conceded removability for entering the United States without authorization (Tr. at 24; Exh. 1). Removability and relief from removal are not at issue on appeal.

2

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel. See also Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. ___, 133 S.Ct. 1103 (2013) (holding that Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, which requires defense counsel to advise a defendant about the risk of deportation arising from a guilty plea, does not apply retroactively).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Denise C. Hochul
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 10, 2013, denying his motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on October 23, 2012. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal the respondent asserts that he did not receive notice of the hearing. The record reflects that the respondent was served by regular mail with a Notice to Appear. The Notice to Appear advised the respondent that he must notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever he changed his address or telephone number during the course of the proceeding. In addition, the record reflects that the respondent appeared pro se at several Mater Calendar Hearings and appeared with his attorney, Stephen K. Tills, at hearings on February 3, 2011, and April 5, 2011. Furthermore, on February 2, 2012, a notice of hearing was sent to the respondent’s attorney, Stephen K. Tills, Esquire. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (stating that whenever an alien is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to the attorney of record). It appears that the respondent failed to stay in contact with his attorney. The record contains a motion to withdraw from Stephen K. Tills, Esquire, filed on April 19, 2012, requesting that he be allowed to withdraw because of lack of communication with the respondent. A notice of hearing was sent to the respondent at his last known address on May 11, 2012. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, finding that the hearing notice was served upon the respondent’s attorney of record.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the notice of hearing provided to the respondent’s attorney of record, at the time, constitutes notice to the respondent. Matter of Barocio, supra. Furthermore, the Immigration Judge properly found that the respondent did not file a change of address with the Immigration Court, nor did he stay in contact with his attorney and provide contact information for himself.
 
*2 Moreover, to the extent the respondent alleges, for the first time, ineffective assistance of former counsel, we find no compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In that case, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned is informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. Here, however, the respondent has failed to even minimally fulfill any of the above-noted requirements. See Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46-47 (2d Cir. 2005) (finding that Lozada procedural requirements are reasonable, and that, at a minimum, “substantial, if not exact, compliance” with Lozada is required). Moreover, the respondent has not established prejudice. See Debeatham v. Holder, 602 F.3d 481 (2d Cir. 2010) (an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show prejudice resulting from counsel’s alleged deficiencies). As such, reopening on this basis is not warranted. The respondent has not established any other exceptional circumstance for his failure to appear. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jessica Vargas-Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dan Gividen
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, and the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) have each filed an interlocutory appeal from the Immigration Judge’s January 29, 2013, decision denying their joint motion to terminate.
 
Although this Board does not ordinarily entertain interlocutory appeals, we have on occasion ruled on the merits of interlocutory appeals where we deemed it necessary to address important jurisdictional questions regarding the administration of the immigration laws, or to correct recurring problems in the handling of cases by Immigration Judges. See, e.g., Matter of Guevara, 20 I&N Dec. 238 (BIA 1990, 1991); Matter of Dobere, 20 I&N Dec. 188 (BIA 1990). This matter involves a recurring problem in the handling of cases by Immigration Judges. We will therefore accept this case by certification and address the merits of these interlocutory appeals. Matter of Ruiz-Campuzano, 17 I&N Dec. 108 (BIA 1979); Matter of Ku, 15 I&N Dec. 712 (BIA 1976); Matter of Guevara, 20 I&N Dec. 238 (BIA 1990, 1991); Matter of Dobere, 20 I&N Dec. 188 (BIA 1990). The appeals will be sustained.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We will sustain the parties’ appeals because we agree that the respondent’s conviction, which was vacated pursuant to the Supreme Court’s decision in Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010) no longer constitutes a conviction within the meaning of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A).
 
Our conclusion in this case is consistent with our decision in Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003), in which we concluded that a conviction vacated on the merits because of a legal or constitutional defect is not a conviction under section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act but a conviction vacated solely because of its immigration consequences remains a conviction under section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act. We recognize, however, that while the application of Pickering to this case is urged by both the respondent and the DHS, the rule in Pickering has not been adopted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. See Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25, 31 (BIA 1989) (explaining that the Board historically follows a court’s precedent in cases arising in that circuit). As the Immigration Judge noted, the general rule in the Fifth Circuit is that a conviction falls within the meaning of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act even if it is subsequently vacated for any reason. See Renteria-Gonzalez v. INS, 322 F.3d 804 (5th Cir. 2002); see also Garcia-Maldonado v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 284, 291 (5th Cir. 2007).
 
*2 We conclude, however, that in this case the Supreme Court’s decision in Padilla precludes strict application of Renteria. In Padilla, the Supreme Court held that an attorney’s failure to properly advise an alien of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment. The respondent’s conviction was vacated on this basis. Applying Renteria to the instant case would render the Supreme Court’s decision in Padilla meaningless because notwithstanding a judicial determination that the respondent’s conviction was constitutionally infirm and that the conviction was indeed vacated, no meaningful remedy would be available to the respondent, contrary to what the Supreme Court contemplated in its decision. Accordingly, we conclude that the respondent’s vacated conviction does not constitute a conviction within the meaning of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act.
 
In light of our determination that the respondent’s conviction does not remain a conviction within the meaning of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, we will sustain the parties’ appeals and vacate the Immigration Judge’s January 29, 2013, decision.
 
ORDER: The appeals are sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s January 29, 2013, order is vacated, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.

File: AXXX XX3 241 - Boston, MA
May 10, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Desmond P. FitzGerald, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 This matter was last before us on February 24, 2012, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for the limited purpose of providing the respondent with the required voluntary departure advisals pursuant to Matter of Gamero, 25 I&N Dec. 164 (BIA 2010). On May 16, 2012, the Immigration Judge provided the respondent with the required advisals and granted her until May 23, 2012, to depart the United States voluntarily. On June 15, 2012, the respondent filed a timely appeal. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge denied her due process at her May 16, 2012, hearing. She indicates that her primary attorney was unavailable to represent her on May 16, 2012, because he was obligated to appear in a criminal case. Consequently, her primary attorney arranged for a substitute attorney to represent the respondent. The respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge denied her the right to counsel by requiring her to proceed without her primary attorney and by not continuing her case. She requests that the Board remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge to provide her with a new hearing in which she is represented by her primary attorney.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request for a continuance of her removal proceedings to await the availability of her primary counsel. See section 240(b)(4)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(A); Matter of C-B-, 25 I&N Dec. 888 (BIA 2012). The respondent has not demonstrated that she was denied a full and fair hearing by the Immigration Judge’s denial of her request for a continuance. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987) (the decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown, and that decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing). The respondent’s removal proceedings were remanded by the Board solely to provide the respondent with the required voluntary departure advisals and to reinstate her voluntary departure period. The record reflects that the respondent was represented by a substitute counsel at her May 16, 2012, hearing. Hence, we find that the respondent was not denied her right to representation. Moreover, the respondent does not allege that her substitute counsel provided her with ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Thus, the respondent has not established that she was prejudiced by having a substitute counsel represent her at the hearing. See Pulisir v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 302 (1st Cir. 2008) (prejudice occurs when it is shown that an abridgement of due process is likely to have affected the outcome of the proceedings); Matter of C-B-, 25 I&N Dec. 888 (BIA 2012). In light of the foregoing, we agree with the Immigration Judge that “good cause” did not exist for a further continuance of these removal proceedings.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

File: AXXX XX9 176 - Buffalo, NY
May 9, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 3, 2012. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. On appeal, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, which constitutes exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear at his August 17, 2007, hearing. A motion based upon exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order of removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely, inasmuch as it was not filed until February 23, 2012.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he acted with due diligence in filing his motion to reopen and that the filing deadline for his motion to reopen should be equitably tolled. The respondent has the burden to demonstrate that he exercised due diligence during the “entire” time he seeks to have tolled, which “includes both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed.” See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008); Cekic v INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006) (“[N]o matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled.”) In this matter, the record reflects that the respondent admits that he was aware that his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order of removal was returned to the Immigration Court by this Board for lack of jurisdiction on April 29, 2009 (Resp. Br. at 3).1 However, the respondent did not properly file his motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge until February 23, 2012. According to the respondent, he relied upon the statements of his prior counsel, who did not suggest that the respondent take further action to rescind his in absentia order of removal (Resp. Br. at 3). The respondent also argues on appeal that he endured “emotional distress/severe depression” and other medical issues during this time period (Resp. Br. at 2).
 
*2 We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated that he exercised due diligence during the time period he seeks to have equitably tolled. The record reflects that the respondent waited nearly 3 years after learning that his appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction by this Board before consulting with a new attorney. The respondent has not demonstrated that his reliance on the advice of his former attorney to “wait for a new law” was reasonable, where the respondent was aware that his former counsel should have filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court to rescind his in absentia order of removal. Furthermore, even though the respondent has submitted receipts, on appeal, for medical services he received during the time period he seeks to have equitably tolled, the respondent has not submitted his medical records or statements from his physical or mental healthcare providers indicating the nature or severity of his conditions. Hence, this Board is unable to properly evaluate the impact that his physical or mental health problems may have had on the respondent’s ability to seek further advice regarding his immigration case. Under these circumstances, we find that the respondent has not met his burden of proof to demonstrate that he exercised due diligence for purposes of equitable tolling of the deadline for filing a motion to reopen to rescind his in absentia order of removal. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Adam N. Crandell, Esquire
*1 This case was last before us on February 22, 2013, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reconsider this decision on March 25, 2013. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion fails to indicate any error in law or fact which would persuade this Board to disturb our prior decision. See generally Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). In his motion, the respondent requests that this Board reconsider his sua sponte request for reopening based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel; in so doing, he argues that exceptional circumstances exist because his domestic violence conviction does not meet the definition set forth under section 237(a)(2)(E)(i).
 
Notwithstanding the respondent’s reliance on Matter of Velasquez, 25 I&N Dec. 278, we find no error in our previous conclusion that he has not carried his burden of demonstrating that the Immigration Judge erred in finding him removable. See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steve S. Chang, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on July 11, 2012, when the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying post-conclusion voluntary departure. This motion, submitted on March 8, 2013, is untimely filed. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to this motion, which will be denied.
 
The motion contends the time limits should be subject to equitable tolling due to ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, counsel was referencing another alien’s file when crafting the brief. Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793-94 (9th Cir. 2005).
 
While the representation rendered was deficient, the respondent has not established that the deficiencies warrant reopening. Reopening is only warranted on the basis of ineffective assistance if the deficiencies may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. Mohammed v. Gonzales, supra (addressing the need for prejudice if reopening is warranted); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (noting the party requesting reopening bears the burden of establishing the new evidence is likely to affect the outcome of the proceedings). As the respondent has not proffered the arguments and claims which should have been submitted on appeal, she has not shown she may have succeeded in her appeal had the brief properly focused on the facts of her proceedings. Additionally, the Board’s decision addressed the respondent’s case carefully and in detail, and we are not persuaded the respondent’s appeal may have been sustained had additional arguments been presented.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William Baker, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening, reissuance
 
*1 This case was last before us on September 15, 2005, when we affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to rescind the in absentia order entered against him. On March 4, 2013, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and reissue asking us to reissue our prior ruling in his case so that he may file a timely petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The respondent’s motion to reopen and reissue will be denied.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. In his current motion, he states that he failed to appear for his hearing before an Immigration Judge on January 6, 2005, because he had been removed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). He further claims that he and his wife did not file a petition for review with the Ninth Circuit after we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to rescind the in absentia order entered against him because his attorney did not inform him that he could do so. He asks that we reissue our prior decision in light of these circumstances so that he can file a petition for review. In the alternative, he asks that we reopen his proceedings sua sponte.
 
The respondent has not presented sufficient evidence to establish that reissuance or reopening is warranted in his case. The respondent’s motion to reopen and reissue is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (stating that motions to reopen “shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal”). Equitable tolling of the filing deadline for a motion to reopen is available when an alien is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent, however, has not provided sufficient information to establish that he acted with due diligence during the 7 ½ years between the issuance of our prior order and the filing of his current motion.1 See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 680 (9th Cir. 2011).
 
In addition, the respondent has provided conflicting information regarding whether he was, in fact, the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In his motion, the respondent states that his prior attorney was not necessarily ineffective because he and his wife understood that the case was over after this Board dismissed his appeal. The respondent further states that he has not filed a complaint against his former attorney because he does not think there has been an ethical violation. In the statements attached to the respondent’s motion, however, the respondent and his wife indicate that they would have filed a petition for review if their former attorney had told them about this option. With these apparent conflicts and the absence of a formal bar complaint, it is not clear that the respondent has presented sufficient evidence to meet the procedural requirements necessary to establish that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); cf. Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1045 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding that prejudice is presumed when former attorney filed untimely petition for review which prevented alien from pursuing petition).2
 
*2 Finally, the respondent has not provided sufficient information to establish that exceptional circumstances justify sua sponte reopening of his proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that our discretion to reopen sua sponte is limited to cases where exceptional circumstances are demonstrated). More than 7 years have passed since we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to rescind and the respondent has not provided much detail regarding what he has done to pursue his case during that time. In addition, there is a significant discrepancy between the statement the respondent submitted with his motion to rescind the in absentia order and the statement he has submitted with his current motion. In his current statement, the respondent indicates that he did not appear for his hearing because he had been removed. In his original statement, however, the respondent stated that he did not appear for his hearing because he thought the Immigration Judge had told him not to appear if he did not have an attorney. The respondent has not acknowledged this discrepancy or offered an explanation for it. He also has not provided any information to support his assertion that he was improperly removed before his hearing on January 6, 2005. Accordingly, based on the totality of the circumstances, the respondent has not provided sufficient evidence to establish that sua sponte reopening and reissuance of our prior ruling in his case is warranted. We therefore deny the respondent’s motion.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen and reissue is denied.

The respondent’s wife states that, over the years, she consulted with two different attorneys who told her nothing could be done in the respondent’s case. The respondent’s wife, however, does not indicate when she consulted these attorneys. The respondent’s wife also does not indicate when she consulted her current attorney or what prompted her to do so. The respondent therefore has not presented sufficient information to establish that he acted diligently in discovering what he alleges is the error of his prior attorney or in pursuing relief from this error.

The issues of due diligence and compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, were not discussed in Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, and the alien sought a remedy less than 3 years after the ineffective assistance occurred.

File: AXXX XX7 378 - Dallas, TX
May 3, 2013
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lisa Koop, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case comes before the Board on remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Raul Mejia-Comez, No. 12-60365 (5th Cir. 2013).
 
In an order dated May 10, 2011, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for relief and ordered his removal to Mexico. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge based on ineffective assistance of counsel, and argued, inter alia, that he was eligible for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). The Immigration Judge denied the motion on June 14, 2011, and the respondent appealed. In a decision dated December 2, 2011, the Board found that the Immigration Judge erred in determining that the respondent was ineligible for relief under section 245(a) of the Act, and it remand the case to provide the respondent an opportunity for a hearing on his application for adjustment of status.
 
This case was last before the Board on April 10, 2012, when it granted a motion by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to reconsider its December 2, 2011, decision. See section 240(c)(6) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Citing the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(e), the Board granted the motion to reconsider based on evidence that the respondent was removed from the United States on June 14, 2011, prior to the respondent’s filing of the appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen.
 
The respondent petitioned the circuit court for review, and in a decision dated January 2, 2013, the circuit court granted a motion by the Attorney General to remand the case to the Board for further consideration of the motion to reconsider, as well as the respondent’s appeal, in light of recent precedent decisions, including Garcia-Carias v. Holder, 697 F.3d 257 (5th Cir. 2012). Following remand, the respondent filed a timely brief with the Board. The DHS has not filed a brief or statement subsequent to the circuit court’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g).
 
In Garcia-Carias v. Holder, supra, the circuit court held that the regulations that administratively barred motions to reopen filed by or on behalf of aliens who had departed from the United States impermissibly conflicted with provision of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Given the decision in Garcia-Carias v. Holder, supra, and the history and posture of this case, we will deny the motion to reconsider filed by the DHS. Accordingly, the Board’s decision dated December 2, 2011, remains viable, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge to provide the respondent an opportunity for a hearing on his application for adjustment of status.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the Board’s December 2, 2011, decision.1

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the December 9, 2011, decision of the Immigration Judge denying her motion to reopen her removal proceedings conducted in absentia on April 6, 2011. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including the Immigration Judge’s determination of credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent’s order of removal may be rescinded if she demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). “The term ‘exceptional circumstances’ refers to exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of an immediate relative of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
The respondent acknowledges that she received notice of her hearing to be held in Memphis, at 9:00 a.m. on April 6, 2011, at which she was ordered removed in absentia. However, after departing from home in Knoxville at 6:00 a.m. on the 6-hour drive to Memphis, the respondent contacted her former counsel. The respondent claims that she did not continue on her journey, which she knew would end at about noon, because her former counsel told her that she had already been removed (Resp. Motion at Affidavit; I.J. at 2).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision with the following notations. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994).
 
The respondent does not dispute that she had notice of her hearing to be held at 9:00 a.m. on April 6, 2011. The notice was mailed on August 19, 2010, more than 7 months prior to the date of the hearing. The respondent has not described any serious illness or death that caused her to delay departure until 6:00 a.m., or otherwise caused her to miss her hearing. The respondent’s departure time, date, and mode of transportation were entirely within her control. The advice the respondent received from her counsel to return home, after the respondent had already created a situation resulting in her absence, is neither compelling nor does it take the circumstances outside the respondent’s control.1 Therefore, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances.
 
*2 Due to the nature of our disposition of this matter, we need not address the respondent’s other contentions on appeal and we find no basis to remand this case for further proceedings. INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25-26 (1976) (as a general rule, courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach). Finally, we are not persuaded that these circumstances require the exercise of our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Elizabeth Treacy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act

Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
 
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings; continuance; motion to remand
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s January 4, 2013, decision finding him removable as charged and ordering him removed from the United States. During the pendency of his appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand. The motion will be denied, and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines, was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on June 26, 2001 (Exh. 1; I.J. at 2). On September 21, 2010, the respondent was convicted for the offenses of possession of methamphetamine, less than 5 grams; and, burglary, in violation of 720 ILCS sections 646/16(a) and 5/19-1(a), respectively, and for the offense of forgery digital signature in violation of 720 ILCS section 5/17-2(a)(4)(2) (I.J. at 3; Exh. 2). For each of these offenses, the respondent was sentenced to 3 years in prison (I.J. at 3; Exh. 2).
 
The respondent does not dispute the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that he is removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal as a result of his convictions (I.J. at 3). The respondent did not file any applications for relief (I.J. at 4). Rather, through his appeal, the respondent argues that he has been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel in these proceedings because his former attorney did not make the argument that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel during his criminal proceedings.
 
In this regard, we first note that the respondent has not complied with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim pursuant to our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), such that he can succeed. Briefly, the Lozada requirements are (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit detailing counsel’s failings, (2) that counsel be informed of the allegations, and (3) that the motion show that disciplinary charges have been filed with the appropriate authority. Id. Second, the alien “must also show that he or she was prejudiced by the actions or inactions of counsel.” See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003). Further, the record reflects that respondent’s counsel did in fact argue the respondent was a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel during his criminal proceedings (I.J. at 4-5). However, as found by the Immigration Judge, the respondent did not provide evidence establishing he had filed for or was granted any post-conviction relief by the criminal court. Thus, he did not establish that his convictions were not final for immigration purposes (I.J. at 4-5). See Matter of Chavez, 24 I&N Dec. 272 (BIA 2007).
 
*2 Through his motion to remand, the respondent argues that his case should be remanded to the Immigration Judge in accordance with Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), because he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel during his criminal proceedings relating to advisals regarding the immigration consequences of his conviction and that he has filed for post-conviction relief collaterally attacking his convictions. The respondent has submitted a copy of a motion he says was filed with the criminal court regarding his collateral attack in support of his request for a remand.1 Notwithstanding the respondent’s assertions, he has not submitted any evidence that the criminal court changed the disposition of his conviction. Without evidence that his conviction has been vacated or otherwise altered by the criminal court, his convictions remain final for immigration purposes. See Matter of Chavez, supra. Therefore, we find no reason to remand the respondent’s proceedings. The respondent does not otherwise dispute the Immigration Judge’s decision in this case.2
 
Accordingly, the motion will be denied, and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied, and the appeal is dismissed.

The respondent also submitted a copy of a letter from his criminal attorney which he alleges establishes ineffective assistance of counsel based on the attorney’s admissions. While, in this letter, the criminal attorney advises the respondent that he will have to seek post-conviction relief arguing ineffective assistance of counsel, the attorney maintains that he did his best during the criminal proceedings. In any event, the letter does not establish that the respondent’s convictions have been vacated by the criminal court.

In its reply brief, the government argues that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion for a continuance. In her written decision, the Immigration Judge does not reference a motion for a continuance. Likewise, the respondent does not raise this issue on appeal.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Arthur V. Cook, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 16, 2012, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen the removal proceedings. The Immigration Judge previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States to Vietnam, following the respondent’s failure to appear on time for a hearing on May 16, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to this appeal. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.1
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The respondent contends that his failure to appear on time for the hearing on May 16, 2012, was due to an error made by his former counsel. In the respondent’s motion to reopen, filed with the Immigration Court, the respondent’s former counsel admits he made a mistake which resulted in him not appearing in court with the respondent, which was the reason the respondent was late in entering the courtroom for his hearing. Based on this assertion, it appears that the respondent is claiming that he did not appear on time at his scheduled hearing due to ineffective assistance of counsel. In Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996), we held that an alien alleging ineffective assistance of counsel who satisfied the requirements set out by this Board in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), had established exceptional circumstances for purposes of section 242B(c)(3) of the Act.
 
In the case at bar, the respondent has not complied with all of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. The motion is not supported by an affidavit or declaration by the respondent regarding the arrangement that was entered into with his former attorney, nor is there any evidence that the respondent filed a disciplinary complaint against his former attorney. However, because the respondent’s former attorney of record represented the respondent during the filing of the motion to reopen, the attorney had notice of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim and admitted that his mistake resulted in the respondent’s late arrival in the courtroom for his hearing.
 
The record in the instant case strongly indicates that there may have been ineffective assistance of counsel. Despite the respondent’s failure to meet the formal requirements of Matter of Lozada, we find that the respondent has presented a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
*2 The respondent did not have a motive for avoiding his hearing. In fact, the evidence indicates that he was at the hearing but entered the courtroom late because he was waiting for his attorney to join him. Likewise, his efforts in seeking reopening of these proceedings without undue delay further demonstrate his intention to appear for his hearing. Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

On appeal, the respondent argues that he did not receive notice of adjudication of his Form I-751, and that it still has not been ruled on so that the Immigration Court lacked jurisdiction in the case to order the respondent removed. However, evidence of record indicates that the Form I-751 was denied on February 18, 2010. As the case is being reopened and remanded, the respondent will have the opportunity to raise that issue before the Immigration Court.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Xavier Rosas, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, was ordered removed in absentia on February 22, 2001. On December 16, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings, which the Immigration Judge denied on March 2, 2012. The respondent filed a timely appeal of that decision. The appeal will be sustained, proceedings will be reopened and the record will be remanded.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen finding that her motion was untimely and did not warrant sua sponte reopening. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied.
 
In light of the unique circumstances presented in this case, including evidence reflecting that the respondent’s former counsel provided ineffective assistance which resulted in the in absentia removal order because of his direction to the respondent not to appear at her February 22, 2001, hearing, an exceptional situation is present to warrant sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. In reaching this conclusion, we note that the respondent’s ability to demonstrate due diligence has been extremely hindered by the ongoing extensive and serious health issues of her lawful permanent resident husband, and we also note that that the respondent appears eligible for cancellation of removal.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, proceedings are reopened and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Philip A. Barr
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of December 10, 2012. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia on September 11, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a motion for summary affirmance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts.
 
Upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent received proper notice of the date, time, and location of her scheduled hearing before the Immigration Judge.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly found that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent (I.J. at 2; Exh. 2). See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 3.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a). The respondent admitted in her motion that she was given verbal notice of her September 11, 2012, hearing, but because her former counsel, Ms. Caballero, kept the written hearing notice, the respondent alleges she forgot the hearing date. On appeal, the respondent alleges that Ms. Caballero never notified the respondent of her hearing date, and failed to return her phone calls.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “““exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996). Here, however, the respondent has failed to comply with the Lozada requirements. See Lara v. Trominiski, 216 F.3d 487; 498 (5th Cir. 2000) (the general application of the Lozada requirements does not constitute an abuse of discretion). Consequently, the respondent has failed to perfect a claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel, and there is no basis to reopen under “exceptional circumstances”.
 
*2 We find that the respondent has not established an exceptional circumstance herein to warrant the sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tina N. Malek, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Scott Simpson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board’s order dated October 8, 2008, remanded this matter to the Immigration Judge for further fact-finding. The Immigration Judge’s August 27, 2009, decision on remand denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status and ordered him removed to Mexico. The Board entered the final administrative order on November 5, 2010, when we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal for failure to file a statement of reasons for the appeal and unexplained failure to file a brief.1 The respondent filed this motion to reopen his removal proceedings on January 15, 2013. The motion is filed nearly 2 years after the filing deadline. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (90-day time limit for filing motion to reopen). The Department of Homeland Security has filed a memorandum opposing the motion, which will be denied.
 
In bringing this untimely motion to reopen, the respondent claims ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board held in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), that due process rights may be violated when ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from reasonably presenting his case, and the time for filing a motion to reopen may be tolled in cases of ineffectiveness of counsel. The alien must, however, show that he was prejudiced by counsel’s performance. In Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003), the Ninth Circuit held that an alien failed to show prejudice when he could not “show that his admissibility arguments might have been successful on appeal to the BIA.” Since prejudice had not been shown, the court rejected an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in that case and upheld the Board’s summary dismissal of the appeal even though counsel failed to file a brief or statement of reasons for the appeal.2
 
Thus, in Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, supra, and Matter of Lozada, supra, counsels’ failure to file statements of reasons or briefs on appeal, although resulting in summary dismissal of the appeals, did not amount to deprivation of due process and was not prejudicial. In each case, the alien received a full and fair hearing at which the Immigration Judge properly considered and evaluated the alien’s evidence and correctly determined the legal issues. The same reasoning applies in the present matter. This respondent, prior to being admitted as a lawful permanent resident, was convicted under the California Penal Code of assault with a deadly weapon; subsequently, he was convicted of using or being under the influence of a controlled substance. The Immigration Judge properly determined that he never lawfully acquired permanent resident status, and was ineligible for waivers under sections 212(c), 212(h) and 212(i) of the Act. See I.J. at 5-6; see also Tr., Oct. 13, 2005, at 3-5. The respondent’s motion, which does not include a proposed appellate brief or offer the arguments that would be contained in a brief, does not persuade the Board that the Immigration Judge’s decision was incorrect or could have been overturned on appeal if counsel had filed a brief, or that the respondent could establish eligibility for any relief in a reopened hearing.
 
*2 The motion to reopen, therefore, does not establish prejudice from counsel’s performance. The respondent’s untimely motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and motion for a stay are denied.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed in part and denied in part the respondent’s petition for review of the Board’s order. Cosuelo-Quintero v. Holder, 497 Fed.Appx. 756 (9th Cir. 2012).

The Rojas-Garcia decision distinguished Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir. 2000), in which the court recognized an ineffective assistance of counsel claim where the alien’s attorney failed to file a timely notice of appeal, resulting in summary dismissal of the appeal. Dearinger found a rebuttable presumption of prejudice, acknowledging that the alien was required to demonstrate a “plausible ground for relief to justify reopening for ineffective assistance of counsel. Id. at 1046. The alien met that standard.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen his removal proceedings on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen must establish the existence of new, previously unavailable, material evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The party requesting reopening bears the burden of establishing that reopening is warranted and that the new evidence would likely affect the outcome of the proceedings. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N 464 (BIA 1992). In the context of a claim of ineffective assistance, the alien must establish that prior counsel’s representation was defective and that the deficiencies affected the outcome of the removal proceedings. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The respondent’s assertions do not demonstrate that reopening is warranted. The attorney who allegedly committed ineffective assistance of counsel did not represent the respondent during the course of his removal proceedings or during a subsequent appeal to the Board.1 Rather, the respondent alleges the attorney committed ineffective assistance during the course of a filing of an I-130 family-based visa petition, an interview associated with the I-130 petition, and the filing of an application for advance parole. These alleged deficiencies took place in the context of separate proceedings which occurred prior to the initiation of removal proceedings against the respondent and which involve matters over which the Immigration Judge and this Board lack jurisdiction.2 The respondent has not demonstrated that his removal proceedings were affected by ineffective assistance of counsel in any respect. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent does allege that the attorney should have represented him during the appeal and that the respondent was left to represent himself pro se. However, the respondent has not provided evidence that the attorney agreed to represent the respondent during the course of the appeal. We note that the respondent was represented during the initial removal hearings, and the respondent has not accused the attorney who represented him below of ineffective assistance.

2

As the respondent is an arriving alien, the Immigration Judge would also have lacked jurisdiction over any adjustment of status application, even had the I-130 visa petition been approved. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(1)(ii).

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

Margaret R. Kugel
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Immigration Judge did not prepare a separate oral or written decision in this matter fully addressing the issues raised in the respondent’s motion to reopen and, therefore, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for preparation of a full decision. See Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994); Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999). The Immigration Judge’s form order dated February 13, 2012, states that the respondent’s motion is denied “for all the reasons set out in DHS Supplemental response.” The form order also notes that “ineffective assistance of counsel argument inapposite when actions complained of were pre-proceeding.” However, the order does not address the respondent’s contention that his prior attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing to advise him that he had been placed in removal proceedings and had a hearing scheduled. Further, while the form order cites to the respondent’s “failure to corroborate mail receipt problems at his acknowledged address,” it does not acknowledge the respondent’s declaration, or sufficiently analyze whether notice was proper. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674-76 (BIA 2008) (setting forth the criteria for determining if a respondent has presented sufficient evidence to overcome the weaker presumption of delivery that attaches to notices sent by regular mail). Finally, it does not address the respondent’s request for sua sponte reopening.
 
We find that the Immigration Judge’s decision provides an insufficient basis upon which the Board can adequately conduct a meaningful review. Upon preparation of the full decision, the Immigration Judge shall issue an order administratively returning the record to the Board.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marlene Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Judith F. Bonilla
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico who was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 2009, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated December 7, 2012, denying his request for a continuance and ordering his removal from this country. The respondent’s appeal, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), will be dismissed.1
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent is subject to removal from the United States under the provisions of section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), as a result of his 2011 Texas conviction for possession of a controlled substance (cocaine) (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 21-22; Exh. 1). The respondent does not allege that, in light of his aforementioned criminal conviction, he is currently eligible for any form of relief from removal which can be granted by an Immigration Judge or this Board.
 
The respondent’s desire to pursue a post-conviction relief claim with the Texas courts did not amount to “good cause” warranting a continuance of these removal proceedings.2 See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. Even though the respondent, through counsel, has apparently made claims before the Texas courts that his criminal defense attorney provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel, and, through his present counsel, he makes such claims before this Board, it is well-established that the statements of counsel are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). On appeal, the respondent does not identify any actual evidence, i.e., personal affidavits from himself or other competent witnesses, which is contained in the record of these proceedings and supports his counsels’ claims that he has a meritorious post-conviction relief claim under Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), and Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Considering the absence of actual and persuasive evidence to support his claims, we conclude that the respondent has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of his claims before the Texas courts. Additionally, given that the respondent’s post-conviction relief claims are currently pending before the Texas Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, his claims have already been denied by a district court (Respondent’s Br. at 9). See Ex Parte: Gilberto Aguilar, No. 08-12-00369-CR (Tex. App. - El Paso filed Dec. 18, 2012) (appeal from the 243rd District Court of El Paso Country, Texas). The district court’s denial of the respondent’s claims significantly undermines the likelihood that the respondent will eventually prevail on the merits of his claims.
 
*2 Overall, considering the lack of evidence presented by the respondent which substantiates the merits of his post-conviction relief claims and his claims have already been rejected by a Texas district court, we conclude that the respondent did not demonstrate that “good cause” existed for a further continuance of these removal proceedings. See Milton v. Holder, 425 F.App’x. 407 (5th Cir. 2011) (recognizing that the Supreme Court’s decision in Padilla v. Kentucky “does not suggest that immigration proceedings must be stayed while a Padilla-type claim is being pursued in postconviction proceedings.”); Cabral v. Holder, 632 F.3d 886, 890 (5th Cir. 2011); Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 815 (BIA 2012) (recognizing that an alien should not be granted a continuance where the continuance is being requested as a “dilatory tactic to forestall the conclusion of removal proceedings”); Cf. Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009) (recognizing that a continuance may be warranted where an alien has demonstrated that he is the beneficiary of a pending immigrant visa petition and established a likelihood of success on an application for adjustment of status). Accordingly, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to conclude these proceedings by entering an order of removal. The following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Even though the transcript of proceedings does not contain a transcript of the hearings which took place after May 21, 2012, the respondent does not allege that the present transcript is insufficient to allow for a meaningful appellate review of the issues presented in this case. See Claudio v. Holder, 601 F.3d 316, 319 (5th Cir. 2010) (holding that an alien’s appeal brief is the “operative document” through which any issues that he wishes to have considered must be raised). Moreover, transcripts are not required, regardless of need, in every case. Matter of Ambrosio, 14 I&N Dec. 381, 382-83 (BIA 1973).

2

We acknowledge that this Board has not issued a precedential decision which explicitly addresses the factors that should be addressed when alien requests a continuance of removal proceedings while he pursues a claim to post-conviction relief. Nonetheless, we conclude that such a precedential decision is not called for in order to adequately address the respondent’s claims. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(g).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on January 4, 2013, when we found that the respondent had waived his right to appeal through counsel. The respondent had not established that his waiver was not knowing and intelligent or that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and we declined to accept the appeal by certification. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider, and now asserts that his waiver was not knowing and intelligent because his counsel had not adequately advised him of his rights, including his right to appeal. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent raises an ineffective assistance of counsel argument, but has not shown compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), and this is not a case was inadequate representation is apparent from the record. See also Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005). The Immigration Judge specifically confirmed with the respondent at the outset of the final hearing that the “gentleman seated next to [him]” was his attorney and authorized to speak on his behalf. The respondent’s best language was English. Thereafter, in the respondent’s presence, his counsel indicated that it had been determined that the respondent could not proceed with an application for adjustment of status and that “we will agree to removal in this case.”1 Respondent’s counsel stated that he did not think there were any “available applications for relief” and agreed that the detained respondent wanted to take an order of removal. The Immigration Judge asked whether “this is a final order” and respondent’s counsel answered “yes.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (regarding action by an attorney of record).
 
While the respondent now states that his attorney did not explain the outcome of the Immigration Judge’s decision to him and that it came as a “surprise” that his appeal rights had been waived, his present claims in this regard are not supported by affidavit or otherwise. And, of equal significance, the respondent has not provided his prior counsel with any notice of these claims and an opportunity to respond. See id. Further, there is nothing presented with this motion that would cause us to reconsider the prior conclusion that further review of the Immigration Judge’s decision by certification has not been shown to be warranted.2 Under these circumstances, we are not persuaded that reconsideration of our January 14, 2013, decision is warranted. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay is denied as moot.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Melanie Cristol, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William P. Hollerich
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on March 27, 2009, when we affirmed without opinion an Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable as charged. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has now filed the instant timely motion to reopen the removal proceedings, based on the fact that the 2007 conviction for inflicting corporal injury on a spouse, which formed the basis of the respondent’s removability, has been vacated due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The DHS asks the Board to remand this matter to the Immigration Judge so that it may lodge an additional charge of removability against the respondent, based on an independent and still viable 2007 conviction for contempt of court for willful violation of a protection order. The respondent agrees that reopening is warranted, but asks the Board instead to terminate these proceedings without prejudice so that he may be released from DHS custody more expeditiously. The DHS’s motion will be granted, and the record will be remanded.
 
Considering the evidence proffered with the parties’ filings, the proceedings are reopened. See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003) (holding that a conviction that has been vacated by the criminal court based upon a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings is no longer a conviction for immigration purposes); see also Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010) (holding that a criminal lawyer representing a non-citizen in connection with a guilty plea has a constitutional duty to advise the defendant that conviction may pose a risk of deportation). Inasmuch as the DHS has stated unequivocally that it intends to lodge an additional charge of removability against the respondent, we find it more prudent to remand this matter to the Immigration Judge, rather than terminate proceedings without prejudice. The respondent may still pursue release from custody from the DHS and/or the Immigration Court, as appropriate. See generally section 236 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1226; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.19, 1236.1.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The DHS’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for proceedings not inconsistent with the foregoing decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marcelo Gondim, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on February 27, 2009, when the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s March 11, 2008, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the January 28, 2008, removal order entered in absentia. On October 9, 2012, the respondent filed the pending motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent does not dispute the fact that his motion is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Rather, alleging ineffective assistance of former counsel(s), he requests that the applicable time limits be equitably tolled. However, the respondent has not sufficiently shown patent error nor substantially complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, including the requirement that he show prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra; Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). The respondent has submitted no evidence beyond what was previously before both the Immigration Judge and the Board to support his claim that exceptional circumstances, i.e., injuries from a traffic accident, prevented him from attending his scheduled hearing. The submitted insurance report does not reflect the respondent’s alleged injuries. Likewise, he has submitted no evidence to support his alleged claim that he ultimately did appear as scheduled, albeit late.
 
Moreover, on this record, we do not find that the respondent has sufficiently demonstrated due diligence in pursuing the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra; see, e.g., Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2007) (explaining that to warrant equitable tolling of a filing deadline, the petitioner must show that he has acted with due diligence). The doctrine of equitable tolling applies when “despite all due diligence, [the party invoking equitable tolling] is unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of the claim.” Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001) (internal quotations omitted). Despite his asserted inability to read and speak English, the respondent does not dispute that he was, at the very least, aware of both the Immigration Judge’s and the Board’s decisions in this case. Other than contacting current counsel, for which the respondent provides no dates or details, the respondent has offered no reasonable explanation for waiting more than 3 years from the Board’s final decision in this case to file the present motion.
 
*2 On this record, the respondent has not provided an adequate basis to excuse the untimeliness of his motion. Nor has he demonstrated an exceptional situation that would warrant reopening of these proceedings in the exercise of discretion under the Board’s sua sponte authority. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathan Love
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 13, 2010, denying his request for a continuance of proceedings pending action on a collateral attack to his criminal conviction. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge sustained the charge of removability based on the respondent’s February 24, 2005, aggravated felony conviction for conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance in violation of Revised Code of Washington §§ 69.50.401(a)(1)(ii) and 69.50.407 (I.J. at 2; Exh. 2). The Immigration further determined that there was not good cause to continue the case pending action in state court on the respondent’s appeal from the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and vacate his criminal conviction (I.J. at 3-4). The respondent asserts on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying him a continuance of proceedings, argues that his immigration and criminal defense attorneys rendered ineffective assistance, and states that he was not guilty of the drug charge.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a motion for continuance “for good cause shown.” See 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.29, 240.6; Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). In determining whether an alien has demonstrated “good cause,” an Immigration Judge has broad discretionary authority. See Matter of Sibrun, supra, at 355-56. Indeed, we have held that “an Immigration Judge’s decision denying [a] motion for continuance will not be reversed unless the alien establishes that [the] denial caused him actual prejudice and harm and materially affected the outcome of his case.” Id. at 356-57. A conviction is final for immigration purposes despite the possibility of discretionary review or collateral attack. See Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894 (BIA 1994).
 
We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision denying a continuance of proceedings pending resolution in state court of the respondent’s appeal from the denial of his request to collaterally attack his criminal conviction. On the day of the merits hearing, a motion to withdraw the respondent’s guilty plea had been denied by the state court. We agree that a further continuance pending adjudication of a state court appeal was not warranted.
 
*2 As for the respondent’s claims of ineffective assistance, we find no basis to remand for further proceedings. As an initial matter, we note that the respondent has not complied with the evidentiary requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his immigration attorney outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).1 Moreover, he has not established that he was prejudiced by immigration counsel’s actions. Although more than 2 years have passed since the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent has not presented any evidence to establish that his state court appeal was successful and that his criminal conviction has been vacated. See Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999) (finding that prejudice must be shown for a due process challenge and that prejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected outcome); Mohsseni Behbahani v. INS, 796 F.2d 249, 251 (9th Cir. 1986) (finding that to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim there must be a showing of prejudice by counsel’s performance).
 
As for the respondent’s challenge to the actions of his criminal defense attorney and his claim of innocence to the criminal charge, these matters are within the jurisdiction of the state court, not the Immigration Judge or this Board. See Matter of Onyido, 22 I&N Dec. 552, 558 (BIA 1999) (it is impermissible for Immigration Judges or the Board to go behind a conviction and reassess an alien’s guilt or innocence). Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 On June 9, 2011, the Board denied a timely motion to reconsider its August 17, 2010, final administrative order, as well as a timely motion to reopen the removal proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel. A petition for review to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit followed, but during the pendency of that petition, the Board issued its precedent decision in Matter of Arrabally, 25 I&N Dec. 771 (BIA 2012). The Third Circuit granted the government’s unopposed motion to remand the matter to the Board to address what effect, if any, that precedential decision has on the respondent’s case. A post-remand briefing schedule was set, but no briefs have been filed.
 
Based on the totality of the circumstances, we will vacate our June 9, 2011, and August 17, 2010, orders and remand this matter for further proceedings not inconsistent with the Third Circuit’s order. On remand, the Immigration Judge shall further consider the respondent’s application for relief in light of our decision in Matter of Arrabally, supra, and other pertinent law. On remand, the parties shall be permitted to submit additional documentary and testimonial evidence on any issues raised. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The Board’s orders dated June 9, 2011, and August 17, 2010, are vacated.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mercedes Victoria Castillo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 20, 2012. The respondent does not contest removability on appeal, but challenges denial of a continuance. The respondent’s appeal fee waiver request is approved. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent requested a continuance to collaterally attack a criminal conviction pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. _, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).1 An Immigration Judge granted several continuances, for several reasons, over the course of the months May through September, 2012, but on September 20, 2012, a request for a further continuance was denied. I.J. at 2.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).2 We conclude that good cause was not shown.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue his post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). An alien may not collaterally attack the legitimacy of his otherwise valid state or federal criminal conviction in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Ponce De Leon-Ruiz, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (BIA 1996, 1997; AG 1997); Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750 (BIA 1993); Matter of Fortis, 14 I&N Dec. 576, 577 (BIA 1974). Neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board has the authority to look beyond the record of conviction to determine the guilt or innocence of an alien in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Reyes, 20 I&N Dec. 789 (BIA 1994); Matter of Fortis, supra. Rather, such collateral attacks must be addressed to the appropriate criminal court.
 
*2 Though the respondent has filed a post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction, it does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992). The conviction became final for immigration purposes when the respondent failed to appeal his conviction, allowed the appeal period to lapse, waived his right to a direct appeal, or exhausted the direct appeal of his conviction. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A); Matter of Abreu, supra.
 
On appeal, the respondent describes several procedural difficulties that arose during the course of these proceedings with respect to communications between counsel and the respondent. While we sympathize with the inconvenience and difficulties faced by counsel in representing the respondent, there have been no facts alleged that persuade us that the respondent did not receive a full and fair hearing.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in his deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates his right to counsel.

In determining whether good cause exists to continue removal proceedings, a variety of factors may be considered, including, but not limited to; the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the motion to continue and the reason for the continuance and any other relevant procedural factors.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard Thompson Herman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Amy L. Sheurman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Lithuania, has filed a motion to reopen the proceedings and requesting that we reconsider our previous decision, dated August 23, 2012. In the decision, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from a September 9, 2011, Immigration Judge decision denying the respondent a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(i). The motion will be denied.
 
We review the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether or not the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
In her motion, the respondent argues that her previous attorney was ineffective in failing to fully develop the record. She argues he failed to have her clarify problems in her testimony concerning a false claim on a student loan application and to have her husband clearly state that he would not travel to Lithuania, but only while his elderly mother was still alive and needed care in the United States.1 She also argues the attorney erred in failing to submit the student loan documentation. We first observe that the respondent has failed to fully comply with the requirements set out in our decision Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857 (6th Cir. 2006); Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). The respondent states that she did not file a complaint against her former attorney as he is a good person. However, this does not excuse compliance with the requirements. Whether or not the previous attorney meant well does not alter the purposes of this requirement, including the deterrence of meritless claims and highlighting the standards expected of attorneys in immigration proceedings. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639-40.
 
Nonetheless, even had the respondent complied with the filing requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, the motion would be denied as she has failed to demonstrate any prejudice from the actions of the previous attorney. See Sako v. Gonzales, supra. The Immigration Judge and this Board rested our denial of relief, in part, on the respondent’s false statement that her daughter was a lawful permanent resident on an application for college financial aid (BIA at 2; I.J. at 13). The respondent has now submitted a printout from the financial aid office indicating that the daughter’s status was recorded as “eligible - non-citizen” and a response from the office stating there was not enough information to confirm the daughter’s noncitizen status (Resp. Mot., Exh. B). The respondent also argues that, at the time of her testimony, she did not clearly recall what information she had provided on the form.
 
*2 However, the printout submitted fails to support the respondent’s argument, as it does not indicate what status she claimed for her daughter. It has never been argued that she indicated her daughter was a citizen. We continue to accept her testimony at the time of the hearing that she indicated that her daughter was a lawful permanent resident (Tr. at 66 (daughter), 96, 130-35). The failure of the previous attorney to properly submit this document is not material to the respondent’s claim, as it does not contradict the respondent’s testimony. Furthermore, while the respondent now wishes to clarify her and her husband’s testimony or supplement the testimony in various ways, this does not indicate that the previous attorney erred in presenting the case.
 
The respondent also argues that the Board failed to apply the proper legal standard and that we failed to consider all of the evidence of record, in particular the letter submitted by a doctor concerning the husband’s psychological health. We disagree. While the respondent may wish that we gave more weight to the letter and its conclusions, it was considered previously (BIA at 2). The husband will face emotional hardship from the separation and does suffer from depression related to the removal process. Although the letter states that separation would result in “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” to the husband, we continue to find the hardship he will face does not rise to “extreme hardship” as provided for under immigration law. See Matter of Cervantes, 22 I&N Dec.560 (BIA 1999), aff’d 232 F.3d 684 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
The Board and the Immigration Judge also properly considered the husband’s testimony, at the time of the hearing that the husband would remain in the United States, due to the health of his mother (Tr. at 85-86). It follows that he may choose to travel to Lithuania once he no longer needs to care for her, but this is speculative. In any event, despite his depression and lack of language skills, his relocation to his wife’s country is not a hardship that is out of the ordinary for a couple where one member is facing removal. In closing, we also note the respondent’s arguments concerning family unity and the remand of her daughter’s record for possible relief. Nonetheless, this remand was part of our previous decision and was properly considered at that time. Based on the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

The respondent has also submitted a letter from the former attorney to the Department of Homeland Security stating that he lacks experience in Immigration Court. However, this provides little support for the ineffective assistance of counsel claim and a review of the record reveals that the attorney provided proper representation.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hans Meyer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Leila Cronfel
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated September 5, 2012, ordering his removal from the United States. We will dismiss the appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. Contrary to the respondent’s assertions on appeal, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) presented evidence in these removal proceedings which established that the respondent was subject to removal from the United States as a result of a conviction for a drug-related crime. See section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). In particular, the DHS filed a “Submission of Evidence in Removal Proceedings,” which the Immigration Judge admitted into the record of these removal proceedings as Exhibit 2.1
 
We acknowledge that not all of the documents contained in Exhibit 2 constitute portions of the respondent’s record of conviction. However, in reaching his decision, the Immigration Judge only relied upon two specific documents: the sentence order contained at page 4 and the plea agreement contained at page 10 (I.J. at 1-2). It was proper for the Immigration Judge to rely upon these two documents in reaching his conclusion that, as the respondent was convicted of possession of a controlled substance (pyrovalerone), he was subject to removal from the United States under the provisions of section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act (I.J. at 1-2). See Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1308.15(d)(1) (designating pyrovalerone as a controlled substance under Schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act). The respondent does not allege that, at the present time, he is eligible for any form of relief from removal.
 
“Good cause” did not exist for a further continuance of these removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 1240.6. The respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear (“NTA”) on June 28, 2012 (Exh. 1). At the time of the respondent’s ultimate removal hearing, on September 5, 2012, he was represented by counsel. The respondent does not allege his prior counsel provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel or that she was somehow unable to effectively represent him. Considering these circumstances, a continuance was not warranted to provide the respondent an opportunity to secure a new attorney. Cf. Matter of C-B-, 25 I&N Dec. 888 (BIA 2012) (holding that an alien did not have sufficient time to obtain counsel where the NTA was issued on January 17, 2012, and the Immigration Judge entered a removal order on January 25, 2012).
 
*2 The respondent’s desire to seek post-conviction relief also did not warrant a continuance. See Tejeda-Acosta v. Holder, No. 12-9503, 2012 WL 6691072 (10th Cir. Dec. 26, 2012); Jimenez-Guzman v. Holder, 642 F.3d 1294, 1297-98 (10th Cir. 2011); U.S. v. Adame-Orozco, 607 F.3d 647, 653 (10th Cir. 2010). The respondent has not presented any evidence that he has actually filed an appropriate motion for post-conviction relief with the appropriate state court. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980) (recognizing that the statements of counsel are not evidence). Considering the lack of evidence presented, the amount of time that the respondent was provided to pursue his post-conviction claims, and the overall speculative nature of post-conviction relief claims, we conclude that the Immigration Judge also properly denied this request for a continuance. See Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 815 (BIA 2012) (recognizing that a continuance should not be granted where it is being sought “as a dilatory tactic to forestall the conclusion of removal proceedings”).
 
As the respondent is subject to removal from the United States, has not applied for any form of relief from removal, and has not demonstrated that a continuance was warranted, the Immigration Judge properly entered an order of removal in this case. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

It appears that, according to the respondent’s arguments on appeal, the DHS also filed a separate “Submission of Evidence in Bond Proceedings.” However, as bond proceedings are separate and apart from removal proceedings, the record of the respondent’s bond proceedings is not currently before this Board. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(d).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Leslie D. Silverman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Pamela P. Ataii
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Canada, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 4, 2012. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and found her ineligible for relief from removal based on her criminal convictions. On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The Notice to Appear alleges that, on October 18, 2011, the respondent was convicted of Petit Larceny, in violation of Virginia law, and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, with 10 months suspended. On March 8, 2011, the respondent was convicted of Possession of a Controlled Drug, to wit: Cocaine. A record of each of these convictions was entered into the record of proceedings. See section 240(c)(3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41(a). Based on this evidence, the Immigration Judge found the conviction proved (I.J. at 1-2). We do not find this factual finding to be clearly erroneous.
 
The respondent was charged with being removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony involving theft1 and a controlled substance violation2 (Exh. 1). The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged (I.J. at 1-2). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s convictions include an aggravated felony and that there is clear and convincing evidence of removability. See section 240(c)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(a); Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276, 286 (1966). Cf. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.15, 1240.10.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent requests remand on the grounds that the convictions, which serve as the basis for removal, and which render her ineligible for relief from removal, are being challenged before the criminal court pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. _, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).3 Moreover, the respondent alleges that the sentence of her Petit Larceny conviction has been reduced to less than 1 year. However, she has not provided evidence of that. She also concedes that the Possession of Controlled Drug conviction has not been vacated.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).4 We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We conclude that good cause was not shown.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue the post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
Also on appeal, the respondent argues that a deferred sentence does not constitute a conviction. However, a conviction includes a deferred adjudication or deferred sentencing, where no imprisonment or fine is imposed, and where the charge is dismissed on completion of probation. See 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(48)(A);5 Matter of Salazar-Regino, 23 I&N Dec. 223 (BIA 2002); Matter of Punu, 24 I&N Dec. 224 (BIA 1998).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The term “aggravated felony” includes a theft offense (including receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least 1 year. See section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G). See also Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. 183 (2007).

2

Any alien who at any time after entry has been convicted of a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act, (21 U.S.C. 802)), other than a single offense involving possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana, is deportable. See section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). Cocaine is a controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. § 812(c), sch. II (a)(4).

3

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel.

4

In determining whether good cause exists to continue removal proceedings, a variety of factors may be considered, including, but not limited to: the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the motion to continue and the reason for the continuance and any other relevant procedural factors. See Matter of Hashmi, supra.

Section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(48)(A), provides:
The term “conviction” means, with respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or, if adjudication of guilt has been withheld, where--
(i) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt, and
(ii) the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien’s liberty to be imposed.

December 13, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lorena N. Gutierrez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on July 28, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On July 30, 2012, more than 1 year after the Board’s order, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). In the motion, the respondent argues that his proceedings should be reopened based on the ineffective assistance of counsel by attorney Keith Willeford, who represented him before the Immigration Judge and the Board (the “former counsel”). The respondent argues that the former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to file before the Immigration Judge a proper application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1), in a timely manner, and by failing to request an extension. The respondent argues that he complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), by submitting an affidavit and notifying the former counsel of his ineffective assistance of counsel claims, as well as filing a complaint with the State Bar of Texas (Motion Exhs. B, C, D). The respondent also submitted an application for cancellation of removal and supporting documents, consisting of his birth certificate and identification card, his son’s birth certificate, his father’s certificate of naturalization, and the approval notice of an I-130 visa petition filed by his father (Motion Exhs. G, K).
 
However, the respondent’s motion is untimely as noted above, and the respondent has presented no arguments, and has submitted no evidence, showing how he acted with due diligence during the 1-year period since the Board dismissed his appeal. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has not addressed in a published decision whether the motion time limitations may be equitably tolled in cases claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 219-220 (5th Cir. 2008) (holding that a request for equitable tolling of a time or number-barred motion to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is “in essence an argument that the BIA should have sua sponte reopened the proceeding based upon the doctrine of equitable tolling”). An alien seeking equitable tolling of a motion to reopen period based on ineffective assistance of counsel must affirmatively demonstrate how he acted with due diligence during the entire period he seeks to toll, and the respondent has not done so. See, e.g., Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127 (2d Cir. 2008); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006).
 
*2 The respondent urges us to sua sponte reopen his proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Based on the circumstances presented in this case, we do not find that the respondent’s case presents “exceptional circumstances” that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied.1
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

We also note that the respondent has submitted documents showing that his father and son are United States citizens and that he is the beneficiary of an I-130 visa petition filed by his father, but he has not submitted sufficient evidence showing that his qualifying relatives will suffer hardship rising to the level of “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” upon his removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (providing that a motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and “all supporting documentation”).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Aarti R. Sampat, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 On September 27, 2012, this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The record showed that the respondent, through counsel, waived appeal. Our decision observed that the respondent did not, in filing his appeal, argue that the waiver was not a knowing and intelligent one. Thus, the Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider, which will be denied.
 
In his motion, the respondent observes that the Immigration Judge’s order did not reflect that the appeal was waived in his case (Mot. at 1-2). The respondent also states that he did not recall waiving appeal in the immigration court and he asserts that the immigration court’s information system confirmed that the appeal in the case was due by July 11, 2012 (Mot. at 1-2). The respondent argues that appeal was not waived in his case (Mot. at 3-4). In the alternative, he argues that any waiver was not knowingly or intelligently made since his attorney did not explain his appeal rights to him (Mot. at 3-4).
 
The transcript in this matter establishes that the respondent was granted voluntary departure, the only form of relief for which he applied (Tr. at 45-49).1 The respondent does not currently dispute that the attorney who represented him at his hearing stated on the record that appeal would be waived. (Tr. at 49). Although the respondent now asserts that his attorney did not explain his appeal rights to him, the respondent has not filed a motion alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Accordingly, he has not established a basis for reconsideration or reopening. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (providing that an alien is generally bound by the conduct of his attorney).
 
We separately note that even if the respondent had not waived his right to appeal, an appeal from a decision that granted the only relief that was requested is subject to a summary dismissal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(C).
 
The respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James B. Rudolph, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brent Landis
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 The respondent, a native of Iraq and citizen of Canada, appeals from the January 28, 2011, decision of an Immigration Judge, denying his motion to reopen in order to pursue adjustment of status. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings and the entry of a new decision.
 
The Board reviews findings of fact by an Immigration Judge only to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent entered the United States on October 3, 2004, as a non-immigrant “F-1” student. He remained in the United States beyond his period of authorization or after January 11, 2005. On May 18, 2005, he married Ms. Kimberly Walker, a United States citizen. During the marital interview in February of 2006, Ms. Walker admitted that she had married the respondent for the sole purpose of helping him become a lawful permanent resident. On October 4, 2006, a Notice to Appear was filed. On February 12, 2008, an Immigration Judge found that his application for adjustment of status had been abandoned but allowed him the privilege of voluntarily departing the United States. The respondent appealed. During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent departed the United States and the decision of the Immigration Judge became final, as though no appeal had been taken. On January 14, 2011, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The motion was denied by the Immigration Judge and is the subject of this appeal.
 
The record shall be remanded for further proceedings and the entry of a new decision by the Immigration Judge. In seeking reopening, the respondent conceded that the motion was untimely. However, he contended that the actions of his attorney at the time of his hearing, Mr. Chukwuma A. Obiesie, were ineffective and that the time limits for filing a motion to reopen, therefore, ought to be tolled based on this due process violation. He explains that he filed to reopen soon after it became apparent to him that attorney Obiesie had been ineffective and this was revealed on November 1, 2010, when he met with his current attorney to discuss his case.1 The motion filed before the Immigration Judge included, among other things, a statement from the respondent signed under penalty of perjury and a response from attorney Obiesie as to the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel made against him.2 In spite of the respondent’s specific grounds seeking equitable tolling and his supporting evidence, the Immigration Judge’s decision consisted of two sentences, denying the motion and finding it to be untimely.
 
*2 In consideration of the respondent’s specific claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the motion to reopen and the absence of any factual findings by the Immigration Judge as to it, we cannot conduct a proper appellate review. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (stating that the Board may not engage in fact finding in the course of deciding appeals except for taking administrative notice of commonly known facts). Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002) (in light of Board’s limited fact-finding ability on appeal, a remand is appropriate when the record is inadequate for review). Accordingly, a remand is warranted for further proceedings. Upon remand, the Immigration Judge shall entertain the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim and enter explicit findings of fact as to whether the respondent has proven equitable tolling to excuse his untimely motion to reopen and if so, whether reopening is warranted as a matter of law and discretion.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings and the entry of a new decision consistent with this decision.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard C. Gordon, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 28, 1991, denied the respondent’s application for suspension of deportation and ordered him deported to Nigeria. The respondent, through counsel, filed a timely Notice of Appeal with the Board. Counsel subsequently failed to file a brief or otherwise present any specific factual or legal basis for the appeal, and the Board summarily dismissed the appeal in our decision entered on January 16, 1992. The respondent filed a motion to reopen these proceedings on August 23, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The motion, filed more than 20 years after the Board’s order in the matter, is barred by the applicable time limit. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (motion to reopen deportation proceedings must be filed no later than 90 days after the final deportation order). The motion does not cite any exception to the filing deadline, but claims that the respondent’s former counsel was ineffective in his handling of the appeal decided by the Board in 1992 (incorrectly asserting, however, that counsel did not file a Notice of Appeal). We note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has held that the 90-day time limit for motions to reopen is “mandatory and jurisdictional” and not subject to equitable tolling, even where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised. See Abdi v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 430 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir. 2005). We further note that the motion does not show that the respondent has complied with the requirements prescribed by the Board in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988), nor does it show that the respondent has been diligent in pursuing his rights over the time period of more than 20 years since the Board’s decision in his appeal.
 
The motion is not accompanied by affidavits or evidence in any form. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (motion to reopen must be supported by affidavits or other material evidence stating the new facts that would be proven at a reopened hearing). Without an evidentiary submission, the motion does not demonstrate either that counsel’s representation was ineffective or that the respondent is eligible for any relief. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 561-62 (BIA 2003) (holding that alien asserting ineffective assistance of counsel must document that he is eligible for the relief sought). Further, while the respondent claims to be eligible for relief, the motion does not include an application for relief as required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).
 
*2 For the above reasons, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and motion for a stay are denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion for change of venue is denied as moot.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Herbert A. Igbanugo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Thomas S. Madison
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on July 16, 2012, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his petition to remove the conditional nature of his residence in the United States under section 216(c)(3)(D) of the Act. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings on October 15, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen shall not be granted unless it appears that the evidence sought to be offered “was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Further, this Board has held that a party who seeks to reopen proceedings to pursue a discretionary grant of relief from removal bears a “heavy burden” of demonstrating that if his motion to reopen were granted, the new evidence presented would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
With his motion, the respondent has submitted over 30 affidavits from friends and acquaintances as support for his claim that he and his wife entered into a marriage in good faith. We find these statements and affidavits insufficient to bear the respondent’s heavy burden to show that such evidence would likely change the result in his case. Id. The various statements are from witnesses not subject to cross-examination; moreover, as the DHS argues in its opposition, such evidence was previously available during the respondent’s hearing. While the respondent states that his attorney should have told him to obtain such statements, he has not prepared an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in accordance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), nor has he otherwise demonstrated how his attorney’s advice, or lack thereof, excepts him from this regulatory requirement. See Fongwo v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 944 (8th Cir. 2005)(attorney’s alleged advice to forego presentation of documents does not mean they were unavailable).1
 
Lastly, we do not find that the respondent’s evidence presents an exceptional circumstance which would warrant reopening in our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997)(stating that “[t]he power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). As we noted in our previous decision, even without the respondent’s adverse credibility finding, the DHS proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent did not enter the marriage in good faith (Bd. Dec. at 2; I.J. at 6). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.

The respondent’s attempt to distinguish himself from Fongwo due to the fact that his affidavits were not yet prepared is an immaterial distinction.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eudene Eunique Valle, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal on October 11, 2012, and the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen on October 22, 2012. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent, who is a native and citizen of Mexico, was found subject to removal as an aggravated felon, based on a 2007 California conviction for receiving stolen property, and sought no relief from removal.
 
The respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from his criminal defense attorney, as well as the attorney who earlier represented him before the Immigration Judge and Board. That is, according to the respondent, neither attorney has adequately assisted him in seeking to have his conviction vacated.
 
As we found in our October 11, 2012, decision, however, and despite the claims against counsel, the possibility that the respondent may obtain post-conviction relief does not change the finality of a criminal conviction for immigration purposes, unless and until it is overturned by a criminal court. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154, 156-67 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996).
 
There is therefore no reason to reopen these proceedings. See Jimenez-Guzman v. Holder, 642 F.3d 1294, 1297 (10th Cir. 2011)(collateral attack on conviction does not disturb finality of conviction for immigration purposes, so continuance motion properly denied while respondent attempted to vacate criminal conviction); Cabral v. Holder, 632 F.3d 886, 890 (5th Cir. 2011) (collateral attack on conviction does not disturb finality of conviction for immigration purposes, so Board did not err in declining to hold appeal in abeyance while respondent attempted to vacate criminal conviction).
 
The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

File: AXXX XX3 886 - New York, NY
November 26, 2012
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
Appeal
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled (sustained)
 
Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)] - Crime involving moral turpitude (sustained)
 
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the El Salvador, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s July 31, 2012, decision finding him removable as charged and ineligible for voluntary departure. We also construe the respondent’s appellate filing as a motion to remand. The respondent’s motion to remand will be denied and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including the determination of credibility, for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof and issues of discretion, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent does not specifically allege error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that he is removable from the United States as charged by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or that he is ineligible for voluntary departure, the only form of relief for which he applied before the Immigration Judge. Instead, the respondent alleges his attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel and that the proceedings before the Immigration Judge violated his right to due process of law. Additionally, the respondent requests remand to afford him the opportunity to apply for several grounds of relief from removal. Finally, the respondent indicates that he is seeking to vacate the conviction underpinning the charge of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), which was sustained by the Immigration Judge.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is removable from the United States under sections 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) and 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(6)(A)(i) (I.J. at 2). The record reflects the respondent, through counsel, admitted all of the factual allegations contained in the Notice to Appear and conceded removability as charged by the DHS (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 17). Absent egregious circumstances, an alien is bound by formal admissions made by his attorney acting in a professional capacity in the course of removal proceedings. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c) (stating that the Immigration Judge may determine that removability as charged may be established by the admissions of the respondent). The respondent’s vague claim on appeal that his attorney did not adequately represent him does not establish egregious circumstances such that the respondent is not bound by those concessions. In particular, we note the respondent has presented no meaningful argument that he is not present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, or that his 2012 conviction for the offense of sexual abuse in the first degree, in violation of section 130.65(3) of the New York Penal Code, is not a crime involving moral turpitude. See Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 244 (2002); Matter of Olquin, 23 I&N Dec. 896 (BIA 2006). Thus, even assuming the respondent and his counsel may not have communicated optimally among themselves, the respondent has not demonstrated any prejudice in his attorney’s concession, because the respondent is, as a matter of both fact and law, removable from the United States as charged.
 
*2 We are also unpersuaded by the respondent’s vague claim that his constitutional rights were violated. As we indicated above, the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent is removable as charged. On appeal, the respondent alleges he was deprived the opportunity to apply for relief from removal, violating this right to due process. Due process requires “the right to notice of the nature of the charges and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.” Brown v. Ashcroft, 360 F.3d 346, 350 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting Choeum v. INS, 129 F.3d 29, 38 (1st Cir. 1997)). However, “[t]here is no requirement, either statutory or constitutional, that all possible defenses or collateral remedies be explained” to the alien against whom the government is proceeding. Brown v. Ashcroft, supra (quoting Aalund v. Marshall, 461 F.2d. 710, 712 (5th Cir. 1972). Our review of the record discloses that the respondent’s right to due process was not violated. Instead, the record reflects that the respondent was apprised of the nature of the charges against him and was provided with a meaningful opportunity to be heard, including the invitation to apply for relief from removal (Tr. at 18).1
 
Additionally, while the respondent claims generally to be eligible for several grounds of relief, including asylum under section 208 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231, protection under the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16-.18, and waivers of inadmissibility under sections 209(c) and 212(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1159(c), 1182(i), he has not established prima facie eligibility for any of the forms of relief he references in his brief. Thus, we conclude that the respondent has not established the proceedings before the Immigration Judge violated his right to due process or that these proceedings should be remanded to afford him the opportunity to explore eligibility for the forms of relief he references in his appellate filings. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992) (stating that a motion to remand is treated similarly to a motion to reopen, and therefore, requires both a showing of prima facie eligibility for relief and the proffer of material evidence that was “unavailable and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.”).
 
We also acknowledge the respondent’s claim that he has contacted a criminal defense attorney and hopes to have his conviction for sexual abuse in the first degree under section 130.65(3) of the New York Penal Code vacated (Respondent’s Br. at 5). However, the fact that the respondent may be pursuing post-conviction relief in the form of a collateral attack on his conviction in state criminal court does not affect the finality of such conviction for federal immigration purposes. Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992). As no evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that post-conviction relief has been granted, the respondent’s conviction is a final conviction for immigration purposes.
 
*3 Finally, while we acknowledge that the respondent and his family may suffer hardships in the event that he is removed from the United States, neither the Board nor the Immigration Judges have discretionary authority to grant relief from deportation solely on equitable or humanitarian grounds or as a matter of public policy. See Matter of Silva-Rodriguez, 20 I&N Dec. 448 (BIA 1992); Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734, 742 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Our review of the record finds no support for the respondent’s claim that he was denied a fair administrative proceeding because he was not provided with a competency hearing (Respondent’s Br. at 3). The record does not disclose any basis for the respondent’s claim that his “mental condition through the course of this proceedings [sic] was below par” or that the Immigration Judge, “should have detected such incapacitation and lack of presence of mind” (Respondent’s Br. at 3). Rather, our review of the record discloses that the respondent answered the Immigration Judge’s queries responsively and appropriately, and that no other evidence in the record suggests the respondent may not be mentally competent. Thus, we are unpersuaded that there are any lingering ambiguities related to the respondent’s mental competency that require remand. See Matter of M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 474, 477 (BIA 2011) (stating that “[a]bsent indicia of mental incompetency, an Immigration Judge is under no obligation to analyze an alien’s competency)

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anne E. Doebler, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 11, 2012. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.1 On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On appeal, the respondent requests remand on the grounds that the conviction, which serves as the basis for removal, and which renders him ineligible for relief from removal, is being challenged before the criminal court pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. __, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).2 The respondent alleges that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his conviction, and he has filed a motion to vacate it. However, the conviction has not been vacated.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).3 We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We conclude that good cause was not shown.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue the post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Removability and relief from removal are not at issue on appeal.

2

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel.

3

In determining whether good cause exists to continue removal proceedings, a variety of factors may be considered, including, but not limited to: the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the motion to continue and the reason for the continuance and any other relevant procedural factors. See Matter of Hashmi, supra.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Reynold E. Finnegan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a 26-year-old male native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s July 30, 2012, written order which denied his motion to rescind his in absentia removal order. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues involving questions of law, judgement and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On October 5, 2005, the respondent was placed in removal proceedings with the issuance of a Notice to Appear, which he signed. He failed to appear at a hearing on November 7, 2007, and was ordered removed in absentia. The respondent filed a motion to rescind his in absentia order, claiming that he had not received notice of his hearing, and an Immigration Judge granted the motion on February 16, 2011.
 
On June 8, 2011, the respondent personally appeared, along with prior counsel, and was informed that his next hearing was on March 23, 2012. Following a hearing conducted in absentia on March 23, 2012, when he failed to appear, an Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal as charged, and ordered him removed from the United States. See generally section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a.
 
An order of removal issued after in absentia proceedings may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
On July 17, 2012, the respondent, through present counsel, filed a motion to rescind his March 23, 2012, in absentia order, claiming that he had not received notice of the March 23, 2012, hearing from his prior attorney because he was in a “disagreement” with her and she allegedly did not notify him about the March 23, 2012, hearing.1 He also requested reopening because his prior attorney allegedly committed ineffective assistance of counsel without elaboration. Finally, he claimed that he had not received the Notice to Appear.
 
*2 On July 30, 2012, an Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen because the respondent appeared in person at the June 8, 2011, hearing and received personal and written notification of the March 23, 2012, hearing, as well as the consequences for failure to appear.
 
We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent’s prior counsel was properly notified about the March 23, 2012, hearing, which constitutes notice to him. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (notice to alien’s counsel constitutes notice to alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). He also personally appeared at the hearing on June 8, 2011, and was notified about the hearing scheduled for March 23, 2012. Contrary to his contentions on appeal, the respondent received personal service of the Notice to Appear, and he was fully informed about the consequences for failing to appear because the Notice to Appear, which he signed on October 5, 2005, indicated that he received oral notice in Spanish about the consequences.
 
Insofar as the respondent alleged in his motion that his prior attorney had committed ineffective assistance of counsel, he failed to specify what conduct constituted the basis of his ineffective assistance claim, he did not comply with the standards to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel because he had not filed a formal bar complaint against his prior counsel, and he has not specifically raised ineffective assistance as an issue on appeal.2 Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Finally, the respondent alleged in a July 16, 2012, affidavit attached to his motion that he “was engaged in a criminal matter at the same time” without elaboration and that he “possibly” may have been in custody on March 23, 2012, but “I am unable to recall the dates of my incarceration.” In addition, the brief submitted on appeal claimed for the first time that the respondent was requesting reopening on the basis of unspecified “exceptional circumstances,” an apparent reference to his possible incarceration on March 23, 2012. However, it is inappropriate to raise exceptional circumstances as a basis for reopening for the first time on appeal because the Immigration Judge has not had an opportunity to address it, and we will not consider it now. Moreover, these allegations are insufficient without more to establish that the respondent was unable to appear because he was in custody on March 23, 2012, and he has not provided any documentation on appeal to establish whether he was incarcerated on March 23, 2012. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

On March 1, 2012, the respondent’s prior attorney filed a motion to withdraw, which was denied on March 6, 2012. She indicated that the respondent had failed to respond to both telephone calls and letters, and had failed to arrive for scheduled appointments.

2

His contentions for the first time on appeal about how his prior attorney allegedly did not notify him about the hearing because she mailed him letters in 2012 which he did not receive due to an incorrect zip code are irrelevant because he already had been personally notified on June 8, 2011 about his March 23, 2012, hearing, and he failed to maintain contact with his attorney.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anna I. Garcia, Esquire
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. He filed a timely motion to reopen on October 9, 2012, after we missed his appeal on September 26, 2012. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be granted, and the case will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.
 
The respondent was found to be subject to removal under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act, in that he was present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. The Immigration Judge, as affirmed by the Board, declined to grant a further continuance for the respondent to pursue post-conviction relief concerning a Kentucky marijuana trafficking conviction.
 
The respondent presents evidence that, on September 7, 2012, his narcotics conviction was vacated in state court. The motion to vacate the conviction in state court was based on ineffective assistance of counsel and cited Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).
 
Where, as here, a court with jurisdiction vacates a conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, a respondent no longer has a “conviction” within the meaning of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act. Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006)(conviction vacated pursuant to Ohio law for failure of the trial court to advise the alien defendant of the possible immigration consequences of a guilty plea is no longer a valid conviction for immigration purposes).
 
The record will, therefore, be remanded to the Immigration Judge so that the respondent may seek any relief from removal to which he may be entitled.1
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nash Fayad, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The final administrative order of removal in these proceedings was entered by the Board on November 13, 2008. On May 30, 2012, the respondent, a native and citizen of Ethiopia, filed the pending motion. The respondent does not dispute the fact that his motion is untimely. Rather, he contends that the applicable time limits should be equitably tolled because of the deficient performance of former counsel(s). The respondent asserts, in part, that former counsel(s) never informed him that his appeal had been dismissed. However, the respondent, who does not dispute that he was aware that an appeal was pending before the Board, has not described or identified what efforts he undertook during the period between the time his appeal was filed and his alleged 2009 discovery that it had been dismissed. Likewise, he has not described or identified what efforts he undertook between his alleged 2009 discovery and the filing of the instant motion 3 years later, other than to hire current counsel, for which he also provides no dates or details.
 
Nor has the respondent sufficiently complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, including the requirement that he show prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
Under the circumstances, we do not find equitable tolling of the 90-day-deadline warranted. See also Harris v. Hutchinson, 209 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir. 2000) (recognizing that equitable tolling may be appropriate where the litigant was either prevented from asserting his or her claim by some kind of wrongful conduct on the part of the defendant, or extraordinary circumstances beyond the litigant’s control made it impossible to comply with the statutory time limit).
 
On this record, the respondent has not provided an adequate basis to excuse the untimeliness of his motion. Nor has he demonstrated an exceptional situation that would warrant reopening in the exercise of discretion under the Board’s sua sponte authority. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey B. Rubin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 31, 2012. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.1 On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On appeal, the respondent requests remand on the grounds that the conviction, which serves as the basis for removal, and which renders him ineligible for relief from removal, is being challenged before the criminal court pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. __, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).2 However, the conviction has not been vacated.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).3 Because the prospect that the respondent will succeed in having his conviction vacated is only speculative, we agree with the Immigration Judge that good cause was not shown.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue the post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). The post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

1

Removability and relief from removal are not at issue on appeal.

2

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel.

3

In determining whether good cause exists to continue removal proceedings, a variety of factors may be considered, including, but not limited to: the Department of Homeland Security’s response to the motion to continue and the reason for the continuance and any other relevant procedural factors. See Matter of Hashmi, supra.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph Zurita, Esquire
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals the Immigration Judge’s August 6, 2012, decision denying her motion to reopen. We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment arising in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo, whereas we review findings of fact in such appeals under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent’s motion alleged that her prior attorney’s ineffective assistance led to the Immigration Judge’s September 16, 2011, decision ordering the respondent removed in absentia.
 
In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we stated that a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement between the applicant and her legal representative and what actions were to be taken on her behalf, (2) that the counsel whose reputation is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) an indication of whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not.
 
Under our de novo standard of review, we conclude that the respondent’s motion to reopen did not comply with Matter of Lozada. In fact, the motion conceded that no compliance had yet been attempted. It instead asserted that evidence of compliance would be submitted later. The respondent submitted no further evidence during the 2 week period between the motion’s filing and the issuance of the Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
Nor has the respondent demonstrated compliance on appeal that would warrant a remand. The respondent has submitted a statement describing the events surrounding the issuance of her in absentia order of removal, see Respondent’s Brief at Tab A, but this statement is deficient, for it is signed but unsworn. Unsworn allegations do not constitute evidence. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of S-M-, 22 I&N Dec. 49, 51 (BIA 1998). Even if this statement had been sworn, the respondent would not have demonstrated compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, for she has not submitted evidence as to whether prior counsel has been informed of the allegations and given an opportunity to respond and evidence whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities.
 
Although the respondent’s motion did not meet the standards for reopening under Matter of Lozada, supra, a motion can nonetheless be a basis for reopening to apply for a form of relief, such as asylum, if the motion contains evidence of circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the final hearing. See 8 C.F.R § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent’s motion, however, did not present evidence of changed circumstances or country conditions arising after the respondent’s final hearing.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX3 358 - Miami, FL

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
*1 A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b), (c). The Immigration Judge’s written decision was mailed to the respondent’s counsel in September 2007. The respondent did not file her Notice of Appeal with the Board until more than 5 years later on October 1, 2012. Thus, the appeal is untimely. The Immigration Judge’s August 29, 2007, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen accordingly remains final, and the record will be returned to the Immigration Court without further action.1 See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.
 
Because we are dismissing the appeal as untimely, either party wishing to file a motion should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court.2 See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See sections 240(c)(6)(A) and (B) and 240(c)(7)(A) and (C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6)(A) and (B) and (c)(7)(A) and (C); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
We separately note that the respondent’s allegations that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel are not meaningfully raised, where she has not complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), nor shown prejudice.
 
*2 In light of the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.

We note that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) - rather than the Immigration Judge - has jurisdiction over the respondent’s request to pursue adjustment of status, as the respondent is an arriving alien. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 107 (BIA 2009). The USCIS can adjudicate an application for adjustment of status without regard to these removal proceedings.

2

To the extent that the respondent is seeking deferred action, that is a matter of prosecutorial discretion outside the Board’s purview. Nevertheless, the respondent may be eligible to seek deferred action pursuant to the June 15, 2012, announcement from the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), which referenced certain young people who are low law enforcement priorities. Information regarding DHS’ Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals may be obtained on-line (www.uscis.gov or www.ice.gov) or by phone on the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services hotline at 1-800-375-5283 or the Immigration Customs and Enforcement hotline at 1-888-351-4024.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marina Alexandrovich, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alec J. Niziolek
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal on December 20, 2011. He submitted a motion to reopen September 14, 2012, also asking for a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the respondent’s motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely as it was filed more than 90 days after the Board’s decision. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). However, the respondent contends that former counsel provided him with ineffective assistance (Motion at 3). Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). He also asks that the Board sua sponte reopen proceedings (Motion at 9). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
The respondent has submitted a statement averring that he filed a state bar complaint against former counsel, Mr. Bracamonte, and mailed a copy of the same to him. However, as he has not submitted a copy of the complaint, it is unclear what errors he alleged Mr. Bracamonte committed. He has not clarified this omission in his motion. In his statement he appears to contend that Mr. Bracamonte erred by admitting the factual allegations, and conceding removability. However, even assuming that was the basis for his bar complaint, he has not identified any error regarding the factual allegations, nor stated a meritorious ground for contesting the charges of removability (Exhs. 1, 1a). Further, as this Board previously noted, the record contains various exhibits supporting the Immigration Judge’s findings regarding both the factual allegations and the removal charges (Exhs. 2, 9, 10, 13). In this regard, we observe that in the instant motion the respondent concedes, rather than contests, his alienage (Declaration). In sum, given this record, Mr. Bracamonte could have reasonably decided to admit the allegations and concede removability. See Knowles v. Mirzayance, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 1422 (2009) ( “Counsel also is not required to have a tactical reason-above and beyond a reasonable appraisal of a claim’s dismal prospects for success-for recommending that a weak claim be dropped altogether.”); Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 934 (9th Cir. 1986) (attorney’s decision to forego contesting deportability was a tactical decision that did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance).
 
*2 In addition, the respondent has not shown that Mr. Bracamonte’s factual admissions and failure to challenge the grounds of removability “may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Iturribarria v. INS, supra at 899-900. Nor has he shown that there were “plausible grounds” for an alternative outcome. Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003). As such, he has not shown that he was prejudiced by Mr. Bracamonte’s actions. Furthermore, we do not find that this case presents exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of our discretionary authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Therefore, his motion is not exempt from the noted time-bar based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Given this record, neither reopening nor a stay of removal is warranted. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia and a lawful permanent resident of the United States since November 8, 1989, has filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s August 14, 2012, decision, denying the respondent’s request for a continuance; and finding the respondent removable, as charged, and statutorily ineligible for relief on account of the respondent’s 2003 Florida Aggravated Battery conviction, as well as his 2010 Florida Organized Fraud conviction, which the Immigration Judge also found to qualify as an aggravated felony “fraud offense” as defined under section 101(a)(43)(M) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M). The appeal will be dismissed. The respondent’s request to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is granted under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). See Matter of Chicas, 19 I&N Dec. 114 (BIA 1984).
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent does not contest the Immigration Judge’s findings either as to his removability or as to his eligibility for relief from removal. The only issue raised on appeal concerns the Immigration Judge’s denial of his request for a continuance while awaiting a decision by the Florida Supreme Court on the question of nonretroactivity of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in the case of Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).1 See Fundora v. State, 86 So.3d 544 (Fla.App. 2 Dist., 2012) (certifying that case to the Florida Supreme Court for a decision on the issue of nonretroactivity of Padilla v. Kentucky). However, in this regard, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not shown good cause for a continuance. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6 (stating that a party seeking a continuance has the burden of establishing good cause); Matter of Luviano, 21 I&N Dec. 235, 237 (BIA 1996) (stating that if good cause is shown, the decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge and that a denial will not be overturned unless it appears that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing).
 
*2 The question as to when the Florida Supreme Court will reach the issue as to the nonretroactivity of Padilla v. Kentucky, and whether it will benefit the respondent, is completely speculative at this point, and does not amount to good cause for an indefinite continuance. The respondent’s conjecture that his convictions might be invalid, including in light of his arguments as to the retroactive applicability of Padilla v. Kentucky, does not change the finality for immigration purposes of such convictions, unless and until they are overturned by a criminal court. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996). The respondent has presented no evidence with this appeal that the Florida convictions underlying these removal proceedings have been vacated, and therefore the respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge’s denial of his continuance request has compromised the fairness of his removal proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

While Padilla authorizes an ineffective assistance of counsel claim where a defendant is misadvised as to the deportation consequences in pleading to a crime, Florida courts have held that Padilla cannot be applied retroactively. See Smith v. State, 85 So.3d 551, 552 (Fla.App. 4 Dist., 2012) (citing Hernandez v. State, 61 So.3d 1144, 1151 (Fla. 3d DCA 2011)); see also McCalla v. State, 77 So.3d 845 (Fla. 4th DCA 2012); Davis v. State, 69 So.3d 315 (Fla. 4th DCA 2011). We note, moreover, the Federal Circuit courts are split as to whether Padilla applies retroactively. See, e.g., Chaidez v. United States, 655 F.3d 684, 686 (7th Cir. 2011) (Padilla does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review); United States v. Orocio, 645 F.3d 630, 641 (3d Cir. 2011) (Padilla does apply retroactively). However, both the Eleventh Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, and the United States Supreme Court have yet to rule on this issue. See U.S. v. Louis, 463 Fed.Appx. 819, 820 (11th Cir. 2012).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Polina Tomashevsky, Esquire
*1 This case was last before us on May 14, 2009, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s June 10, 2008, decision finding him removable as an aggravated felon. The respondent has now filed, on June 8, 2012, an untimely motion to reopen proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be granted pursuant to our sua sponte authority.
 
The procedural history of this case is as follows: The Immigration Judge initially granted the respondent’s motion to terminate proceedings on February 11, 2005, finding that the respondent was not removable under either section 237(a)(1)(C)(I) nor section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act. Subsequently, in a decision dated September 11, 2006, the Board reversed the Immigration Judge’s decision, and found that the respondent was removable pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act for having violated his nonimmigrant status. We further found that the respondent’s conviction for resisting arrest constituted a crime of violence under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, and therefore created his removability as an aggravated felon under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act. As such, we remanded the record for further proceedings regarding the respondent’s requests for relief from removal, or, in the alternative, for an entry of a final order of removal. The respondent appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,1 but also appeared before the Immigration Court again, and stated on remand, through his attorney, that “we’re reserving all relief. We don’t have any relief at this moment (Tr. at 64). Accordingly, the Immigration Judge issued a summary order of removal on June 10, 2008, indicating that the respondent had not applied for relief. The respondent appealed this decision on September 26, 2008, arguing that the Immigration Judge had erred in finding the respondent removable as an aggravated felon. On May 14, 2009, we found that because the respondent had appealed to the Fourth Circuit rather than filing a timely motion to reconsider our June 10, 2008, decision, we would decline to revisit our previous decision, and we dismissed the respondent’s appeal (2009 Bd. Dec. at 1). The respondent has now filed a motion, on June 8, 2012, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his prior proceedings because his prior counsel did not pursue an adjustment of status application in his behalf, even though he had originally requested such relief prior to the Board’s 2005 remand of his proceedings (Tr. at 2-3, 40).
 
*2 In support of these arguments, the respondent has filed evidence in substantial compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent has also filed evidence in support of his claim that he has maintained an approved visa petition through his brother, with a current priority date, since 2003 (Tr. At 3-4), but that at the remanded hearing in 2007, his attorney stated that no relief was available to the respondent (Tr. at 51, 64). The respondent has also submitted an adjustment of status application, as well as various documents in support of his application for relief.
 
We find that a remand is warranted in our sua sponte authority. It does appear that due to the complicated procedural history of the respondent’s case, his opportunity to demonstrate eligibility for adjustment of status was overlooked at his various hearings. Inasmuch as the respondent does not appear prima facie ineligible for such relief, and given the particular circumstances in the respondent’s case, including the DHS’ lack of opposition, we will reopen the respondent’s proceedings under our sua sponte authority and will provide him a further opportunity to seek relief from removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Upon remand, both parties may further address the respondent’s statutory and discretionary eligibility for adjustment and any commensurate waivers of inadmissibility. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.
