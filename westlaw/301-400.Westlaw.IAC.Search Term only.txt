IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose E. Perez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joy A. Merriman
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent timely appeals the Immigration Judge’s June 4, 2015, decision denying his motion to reopen and reconsider. The respondent has filed a motion to accept his late filed brief, which we grant. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief in opposition. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review issues of law, discretion, or judgment de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the motion to reopen and reconsider were untimely filed (IJ at 3). See sections 240(c)(6) and (7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6) and (7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1). Further, the respondent has not demonstrated that any exception to the time limitation on reopening applies. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4). On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in declining to exercise his discretionary sua sponte authority to reopen and/or reconsider his final order of removal. We agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the motions.
 
We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s discretionary denial of reopening for the reasons set forth in his decision denying reopening (IJ at 3-5). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent requested sua sponte reopening so that DHS may exercise its prosecutorial discretion (Motion to Reopen Sua Sponte filed 4/8/15). The DHS has not indicated that it will exercise its prosecutorial discretion in this case, and neither the Immigration Judge nor the Board have the authority to order DHS to do so. Further, the relief that the respondent seeks from DHS may not be available. See United States v. Texas, -- S.Ct.--, 2016 WL 3434401 (June 23, 2016), aff’g, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015). Since the respondent did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances for reopening proceedings, the Immigration Judge did not err in declining to exercise his discretionary sua sponte authority to reopen.
 
We also find no error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of reconsideration as moot (IJ Dec. dated 6/4/15 at 5). During proceedings before the Immigration Judge, the respondent, through counsel, admitted that he was not a citizen of the United States, that he was a citizen of Mexico, that he entered the United States illegally, and that he was removable as charged (Exh. 1; IJ Dec. dated 6/4/15 at 2, 4; IJ Order dated 10/20/14). His concession of removability was a condition precedent for the only relief he sought See section 240B(a)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i). Based on the respondent’s concessions, inter alia, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent the right to voluntarily depart within 120 days of the issuance of his order. Since the respondent did not voluntarily depart, the Immigration Judge’s order converted to an order of removal effective as of October 20, 2014.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent does not dispute the Immigration Judge’s finding as to alienage. Rather, the respondent argues, as he did in his motion to reconsider, that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated during a stop, which subsequently brought him to the attention of DHS and caused him to be placed in proceedings (Motion to Reconsider filed 3/19/15).1 The respondent contends, as he did before the Immigration Judge, that equitable tolling applies because he pursued his rights diligently and some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way (Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 8-11). The respondent argues that he was not aware of the constitutional violation of his rights until he spoke to his new lawyer.
 
Evidence obtained as a result of a Fourth Amendment violation is suppressible in the course of a civil deportation proceeding only if the violation is egregious or undermines the reliability of the evidence in dispute. See Almeida-Amoral v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 231, 235 (2d Cir. 2006); see also INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1050-51 (1984). An individual in removal proceedings who raises a question about the admissibility of evidence must come forward with proof establishing a prima facie case before the Government will be called on to assume the burden of justifying the manner in which it obtained the evidence. Cotzojay v. Holder, 725 F.3d 172, 178 (2d Cir. 2013).
 
Here, the respondent did not submit a signed, dated affidavit in support of his assertions (IJ Dec. dated 10/20/14 at 4 n. 1). See Motion to Reconsider Sua Sponte at pp. 23-24 (26-27). Moreover, it is well settled that arguments of counsel are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980). As such, the respondent did not meet his burden of proving a prima facie case. Cotzojay v. Holder, supra.
 
Even assuming, purely for the sake of argument, that the information was obtained through an egregious constitutional violation, the respondent’s alienage was established through means independent of any evidence of the stop he wished to suppress. See Vanegas-Ramirez v. Holder, 768 F.3d 226, 236 (2d Cir. 2014) (an alien’s concessions of removability are not fruit of the illegality, but an intervening act of free will); Pretzantzin v. Holder, 736 F.3d 641, 651 (2d Cir. 2013) (evidence of alienage is admissible if obtained through means independent of or sufficiently attenuated from the primary illegality).
 
The Immigration Judge found, and the respondent does not dispute on appeal, that the respondent admitted during his removal proceeding that he was not a citizen or national of the United States and was a native and citizen of Mexico (IJ Dec. dated 6/4/15 at 2, 4). The respondent conceded alienage about two years after the date of the alleged violations, with the assistance of counsel.2 As a result, the concession of alienage was sufficiently independent of any violation that may have previously occurred. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge correctly denied the motion to reconsider sua sponte as moot and the appeal shall be dismissed.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: YONG TEAK LEE A.K.A. YONG LEE
File: AXXX XX6 569 - Atlanta, Georgia
July 12, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hiba Ghalib, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of South Korea, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 24, 2016, denying his motion to reopen the removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, and the likelihood of future events, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record reflects that the respondent and his attorney appeared at a continued Master Calendar hearing on November 5, 2015. Based on the respondent’s admissions and concession of removability (Exh. 2) entered at the May 15, 2015, hearing, the Immigration Judge entered an order granting the respondent’s request for pre-conclusion voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), with an alternate order of removal if he failed to depart on or before March 4, 2016. However, the respondent failed to voluntarily depart by the March 4, 2016, deadline. Instead, on March 4, 2016, he filed a motion alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, and seeking reopening in order to apply for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, 8 C.F.R. § 1255, based on his recent marriage to a United States citizen who had filed an immediate relative immigrant visa petition (Form I-130) on his behalf.
 
The record includes a document (Exh. 3) explaining the conditions attendant to the grant of the request for pre-conclusion voluntary departure, including the waiver of appeal, signed by both the respondent and his attorney on November 5, 2015, indicating their understanding and acceptance of the terms of the agreement. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i). The Immigration Judge’s November 5, 2015, decision became an administratively final order on that date when the respondent agreed to the terms of the grant of pre-conclusion voluntary departure, waived appeal and accepted that decision as final. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.14 and 1003.39.
 
*2 With certain limited exceptions, an alien is permitted to file one motion to reopen a final administrative order of removal, not later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent filed his motion to reopen on March 4, 2016, more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s administratively final order entered on November 5, 2015. Thus, the Immigration Judge properly denied the motion as time-barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
Moreover, to the extent that respondent is arguing that his legal representation before the Immigration Court was deficient, we agree with the Immigration Judge (3-4) that the respondent has not satisfied the procedural requirements for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); accord Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir. 2003). Notwithstanding, even if we were to find the respondent had complied with the Lozada requirements, in order to establish ineffective assistance of prior counsel, the respondent must establish that his former counsel’s performance was so deficient that it impinged the “fundamental fairness” of the hearing and he suffered prejudice thereby. See Ali v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 643 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir. 2011) (alien must establish prejudice in order to prevail on ineffective assistance claim), citing Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, 178 F.3d 1139, 1146 (11th Cir.1999); see also Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273-74 (11th Cir.2005) (“Prejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.”); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (establishing ineffective assistance of counsel requires an alien to demonstrate prejudice from counsel’s conduct, such that it compromised the fundamental fairness of the hearing). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, supra at 561. Here, no such prejudice has been shown.
 
Although the respondent now claims prejudice in that he would not have agreed to the grant of voluntary departure, if he had known he had other options, he does not identify in his motion what were those other options. Rather, the record reflects respondent’s former counsel elected to pursue the only apparent form of relief from removal then available to the respondent, pre-conclusion voluntary departure. An attorney’s tactical decisions in the preparation and presentation of an alien’s case, including accepting an extended period of voluntary departure, do not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel. See, e.g., Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 934 (9th Cir. 1986). We find no violation of due process or a denial of a fair hearing, as the respondent, represented by counsel, had ample opportunity to meet with him; and prepare for and present his case before the Immigration Court.
 
*3 Further, while an Immigration Judge retains limited discretionary authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte in “exceptional situations,” see Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997), we agree with the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 4-5) that the respondent’s motion presented no such situation.
 
Therefore, in light of the foregoing, we find that the Immigration Judge was correct in denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. Finally, in view of our disposition, the respondent’s request for a stay of removal will be denied. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion for a stay of removal is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jason A. Nielson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William M. Hunt
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s motion is untimely filed and is denied on that basis. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The motion has not been shown to satisfy any exception to the time limitations imposed by law on motions to reopen removal proceedings. Further, untimely motions to reopen to apply for adjustment do not fall within any statutory or regulatory exception to the time limits on motions and generally will be denied. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 105 (BIA 2009).
 
Moreover, we decline to equitably toll the applicable time limits based on the respondent’s asserted ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for advancing such a claim, or the requirement that he show prejudice resulting from former counsel’s alleged deficient performance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). Further, the respondent does not dispute that at the very least, he was aware of the Board’s February 7, 2012, decision approximately 3 months after the decision was issued. Other than hire current counsel, for which the respondent provides no dates or details, the respondent has not offered a persuasive explanation for waiting more than 4 years to file the present motion.
 
On this record, the respondent has not provided an adequate basis to excuse the untimeliness of the present motion. Nor has he demonstrated an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretion to reopen his proceedings under our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “[t]he power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph A. Baker, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Hilary Rainone
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia, appeals from the May 19, 2015, decision of the Immigration Judge denying a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including those on credibility, for clear error, and review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues on appeal on a de novo basis. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
The respondent was granted multiple continuances to await a decision on his application for deferred status pursuant to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) which was ultimately denied. At his hearing before the Immigration Judge in May 2015, the respondent requested a further continuance to file a motion to vacate a criminal conviction. However, the pursuit of post-conviction relief does not constitute good cause to delay proceedings since the outcome of such an endeavor would be speculative, and a conviction is considered final for immigration purposes unless and until it is overturned. See Matter of Cuellar, 25 I&N Dec. 850, 855 (BIA 2012); Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987) (the decision to grant or deny a continuance for good cause is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge and will not be overturned on appeal unless it is shown that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6. Therefore, we find no error in the decision of the Immigration Judge to deny the respondent’s motion for a further continuance. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
To the extent that the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in his removal proceeding, we find that he has failed to substantially comply with the procedural requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). By the respondent’s own admission, he has taken only initial steps to file a formal complaint with the state bar where his prior counsel is licensed (Brief at 4). Furthermore, former counsel’s alleged failure to file a motion in state court regarding the respondent’s criminal conviction is not relevant to these removal proceedings. We thus find that he has not established that prior counsel’s representation resulted in the prejudice necessary to prevail on such a claim. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Accordingly, the motion to remand will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sergio VeLarde, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on January 15, 2016, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and seeking reopening to reapply for cancellation of removal. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. Considering the totality of the circumstances presented, including the evidence submitted, we will grant the motion and remand the proceedings to provide the respondent a further opportunity to pursue relief. We do not express an opinion on the merits of the respondent’s entitlement to relief. On remand, the Immigration Judge may receive any additional evidence he deems appropriate to the full resolution of this matter. Accordingly, the motion will be granted.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings not inconsistent with this order.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Hana A. Sato
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India who was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on July 14, 2005, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge dated July 1, 2015, denying her motion to reopen. The respondent has filed an appeal brief, as well as a supplemental brief with additional evidence and argument, which we have construed as a motion to remand. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has expressed opposition to the appeal and the motion. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and her motion will be denied.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
An in absentia order of removal may be rescinded only where (1) the alien files a motion to reopen within 180 days of the date of the order of removal and demonstrates that the failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1), or (2) at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) and (2) of the Act, or was in Federal or State custody and the failure to appear was through no fault of the respondent. See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i)-(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 722-23 (BIA 1999).
 
Proper notification under section 239(a)(1) of the Act includes informing an alien of the time and place for his or her scheduled appearance before an Immigration Judge. See section 239(a)(1)(G)(i) of the Act. Where a hearing notice is properly addressed and sent by regular mail according to normal office procedures, a presumption of delivery attaches, although it is weaker than the presumption that applies to documents sent by certified mail. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 671-73 (BIA 2008). Additionally, a hearing notice is properly served on an alien if served on the alien’s counsel of record. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; see also Garcia v. INS, 222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
In her motion, which she filed on March 13, 2015, the respondent sought reopening of her proceedings on the basis of lack of notice. Specifically, the respondent alleged that she received no notice of her July 14, 2005, hearing, which demonstrated inadequate representation by her former counsel preventing her from having an opportunity to present her case. The respondent also alleged in her motion that the consequences for failing to appear at her hearing were not adequately represented to her at any time after her proceedings were initiated because the warnings in the Notice to Appear were given in a language that she barely spoke (Hindi) and she did not speak, write, or read English in 2005.1 She further alleged that her former attorney’s assertion (per the tape recordings of her in absentia hearing) that he informed her of her hearing date was not true as she never heard from her attorney after she last saw him at her bond hearing. According to the respondent, she first learned of her removal order in March or April 2013 after she hired an attorney to help her look into her immigration status and she never saw a copy of the in absentia removal order until her current attorney, with whom she started speaking in July 2014, showed it to her (Respondent’s Motion at 1-9 and Tab B, Affidavit).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge failed to consider whether she overcame the presumption of receipt under Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008), and instead simply concluded that she received proper notice because the Notice of Hearing (“NOH”) was sent to her attorney, without addressing her allegations regarding lack of notice (Respondent’s Brief at 4-7). The respondent also argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge completely ignored her contentions that her former counsel’s actions were shockingly inadequate and his performance so prejudicial as to warrant [a finding of] ineffective assistance. She asserts that she has a lack of understanding of the terms of her agreement with her former counsel and that she never filed a complaint against him but argues that, because she never signed an agreement with her former counsel, she should not be held to the same strict compliance [requirements] of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), as an individual who personally hired and signed an agreement with her attorney (Id. at 7-9).
 
The respondent also challenges on appeal the Immigration Judge’s finding that, by filing her motion almost 10 years after she was ordered removed in absentia, she did not demonstrate due diligence. According to the respondent, the delay was not unreasonable as she diligently pursued relief “since she discovered the circumstances of her claim” (Id. at 9-11). Finally, the respondent argues that sua sponte reopening of her proceedings is warranted because she intends to seek a provisional waiver, followed by a request for lawful permanent residence through consular processing, based on an approved visa petition; she is the primary caretaker of her United States citizen husband, who lost his right eye in 2000 and has had four eye surgeries in 14 years, as well as of their two United States citizen children; and, as a person of good moral character with no criminal record, is not a priority for removal under the DHS’s current guidelines (Id. at 11-13).
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s appellate arguments and we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision for the reasons stated in the decision (I.J. at 1-5). The respondent has not alleged that the NOH was not delivered as mailed and there are no indications on this record that that notice did not reach the respondent’s former attorney. Thus, as there is no question that the presumption of delivery attaches (section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act), the respondent’s argument that she did not receive notice of her hearing does not support a claim for reopening (Id. at 2-3).
 
Additionally, the respondent did not file her motion within 180 days of her removal order nor establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel so as to obtain equitable tolling of the filing deadline (Id. at 3-4). We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). Precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this case arises, provides that while the requirements of Lozada are generally reasonable, they need not be rigidly enforced where their purpose is fully served by other means (I.J. at 4). See Correa-Rivera v. Holder, 706 F.3d 1128, 1131 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002)); see also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (“Lozada is intended to ensure both that an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one”).
 
*3 We agree with the Immigration Judge that the general statements proffered by the respondent in her motion do not provide a clear indication of ineffective assistance of counsel and that the respondent has not complied with any of the Lozada requirements. First, the respondent’s affidavit does not detail the agreement that was entered into with her former counsel. Instead, it offers a vague reference of the nature of the respondent’s agreement with her attorney. Second, the respondent has conceded that she has not informed her former counsel of the allegations she has made against him, which has prevented that counsel from having an opportunity to respond to those allegations. Third, the respondent has not filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority against her former counsel or explained why such a complaint has not been filed (Id. at 3).
 
We further agree with the Immigration Judge that the evidence in this case shows a lack of due diligence by the respondent. The respondent could have discovered her former counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness when she hired her second attorney in March or April 2013 or, at the latest, in July 2014, when she spoke with her current attorney about the documents she has obtained pursuant to a FOIA request, yet she filed her motion in May 2015 (Id. at 4).
 
We find that, under the circumstances of this case, the respondent has not established a basis to rescind the Immigration Judge’s in absentia removal order and reopen her proceedings.
 
We also find that the respondent has not established that sua sponte reopening of these proceedings is warranted. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We do not find that the information provided by the respondent in this regard establishes that her case presents a truly exceptional situation warranting reopening.
 
In her motion, the respondent asks that we consider one of our unpublished decisions, dated June 25, 2015, in which we issued a remand after concluding that administrative closure to allow the alien to pursue an I-601 provisional waiver application may constitute relief for purposes of reopening. We will deny the motion for the reasons stated by the DHS in its brief opposing the respondent’s motion. See DHS’s brief titled “Department’s Opposition to the Respondent’s ‘Supplement to Respondent’s Brief in Support of Appeal.”DD’ First, the respondent’s submission, which was received after the September 17, 2015, deadline we set when we granted a briefing extension request on August 27, 2015, does not comply with the Board Practice Manual’s requirement that a brief filed outside the period granted in a briefing schedule be accompanied by a Motion to Accept Supplemental Brief that complies generally with the rules for motions, including service on the opposing party. See Board Practice Manual, section 4.7(g). Second, the respondent is asking the Board to rely on an unpublished decision, which has no precedential value. Third, even if we were to consider the non-precedential decision submitted with the motion, the circumstances in that case are very different from those in the instant case, particularly in that the motion in that case was timely filed. Thus, the respondent in the instant case is not similarly situated as the alien in our unpublished decision that he now seeks to have admitted into the record.
 
*4 Given the foregoing, we decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen and will deny the respondent’s motion to remand. Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Margaret W. Wong, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of June 19, 2015. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s June 10, 2015, motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on June 3, 2010. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The Notice of Hearing (NOH) for the June 3, 2010, hearing was mailed to the respondent’s former counsel, Barry Frager, Esquire, on December 16, 2009 (I.J. at 1; Exh. 3). The respondent failed to appear at his hearing and an in absentia order was entered on June 3, 2010. The respondent filed a motion to reopen in absentia proceedings through present counsel on June 10, 2015, alleging that he did not receive notice of his hearing. The motion further alleged that prior counsel failed to inform the respondent of his hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding reopening not warranted based upon lack of notice because notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent (I.J. at 2-3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
While the respondent alleges his counsel did not notify the respondent of his hearing date, the Immigration Judge properly found that the respondent has not shown ineffective assistance of counsel insofar as he has not complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988)(I.J. at 2-3). See Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857, 863 (6th Cir. 2006). We find without merit the respondent’s appellate contention that strict adherence to the Lozada requirements is not necessary (Respondent’s Brief, at 8), where the respondent has not explained his failure to fulfill any of the Lozada requirements. See Ibarra-Reina v. Lynch, __ F.3d __ No. 15-3395, 2016 WL 3212266, at 4 (6th Cir. June 7, 2016) (holding that although Lozada is not enforced rigidly, neither have requirements been as loosely applied as the alien suggests).1
 
*2 In Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998), the Board held that an alien may reopen for purposes of pursuing previously unavailable relief in circumstances where she was not given oral warnings in her native language of the consequences of failing to appear at a deportation hearing and where the motion complies with the general time limits governing motions to reopen. The motion is untimely, however, and thus reopening on this basis is not warranted.
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge that no exceptional circumstances have been presented to warrant sua sponte reopening (I.J. at 11). Pursuant to our holding in Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), the power to reopen sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). While the respondent has presented some positive factors and alleges hardship to his U.S. citizen spouse and children, these factors either individually or in the aggregate are not so exceptional as to trigger the limited authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte. Indeed, many aliens who have been present in the United States for a period of years have accumulated favorable equities subsequent to being ordered removed. See Matter of Bedford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000) (burden is on the movant to show exceptional circumstances).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We find meritless the respondent’s argument on appeal that the Immigration Judge failed to consider Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 675 (BIA 2008) (Respondent’s Brief, at 7). That decision is inapposite because the facts are distinguishable from the case here.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Berc Agopoglu, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated March 15, 2016,1 denying his motion to reopen. We will dismiss the appeal.2
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear on March 7, 2006 (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). On January 25, 2007, the Court mailed written notice of a rescheduled hearing, both to the respondent, at his address of record, and to his former attorney (I.J. at 2; Exh. 2). As the respondent did not appear at the scheduled June 11, 2007, hearing, the Immigration Judge proceeded in absentia and ultimately ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States (I.J. at 2). The respondent filed his motion to reopen on February 29, 2016 (I.J. at 2).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent’s motion did not contain sufficient evidence to establish that reopening was warranted on account of lack of notice. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). In particular, the respondent has not submitted sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that the United States Postal Service effectively delivered the Notices of Hearing (NOH) to himself and his attorney. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008) (holding that there is a slight presumption of delivery where notice is sent by regular mail and setting forth factors which should be considered when evaluating a claim that a NOH was not received); see also Sembiring v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 981 (9th Cir. 2007); Salta v. INS, 314 F.3d 1076 (9th Cir. 2002). In support of reopening, the respondent did not present an affidavit from either himself or his former attorney disavowing receipt of the NOH. Even assuming for purposes of analysis that the assertions in the motion to reopen could substitute for an affidavit from the respondent, neither the motion nor the respondent’s appeal brief meaningfully contends that the respondent’s former attorney never received the NOH that the record indicates was sent to him. See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (providing that when a person is represented, any required notice shall be given to his counsel of record); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that service on an alien’s counsel of record constitutes notice to the alien). Nor has the respondent contended in the alternative that his former attorney received the NOH but failed to inform the respondent of the hearing date, or that his former attorney in any other way provided deficient representation that potentially could give rise to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Considering these circumstances, we conclude that the Immigration Judge properly declined to reopen these proceedings on the basis of lack of notice (I.J. at 2-3).
 
*2 The respondent’s motion was otherwise untimely. See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i), (c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), (4)(ii). The respondent has not meaningfully articulated changed conditions in El Salvador which would permit him to file an otherwise untimely motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i).
 
To the extent that the respondent seeks sua sponte reopening of these proceedings, such measures have not been shown to be warranted. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We note in particular that over 8½ years elapsed between the entry of the in absentia order in the (duly noticed) proceedings and the filing of the respondent’s motion to reopen, which evinces a lack of due diligence in the pursuit of his claims.3 Accordingly, we decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
We acknowledge the respondent’s counsel’s appellate claim that the Immigration Judge erred in ruling on the respondent’s motion to reopen while (allegedly) not in possession of the record of proceedings (Respondent’s Brief at 4). However, upon our review, we conclude that the respondent has not established that the manner in which the Immigration Judge adjudicated his motion to reopen was insufficient or defective in any regard. The respondent’s counsel’s speculative belief that because the respondent’s file was not available for him to review at the Los Angeles Immigration Court on January 30, 2016, then the Immigration Judge must not have been in possession of the record of proceedings on March 15, 2016, when she denied the motion, is unsupported by objective evidence.4 Thus, we find no grounds upon which to conclude that the respondent was prejudiced or that he suffered any due process violation such that remanded proceedings would be warranted for further consideration of his motion to reopen.
 
For the reasons set forth above, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The Immigration Judge’s decision was mailed to the parties on March 21, 2016.

2

As we will dismiss the respondent’s appeal, his request to stay his removal pending adjudication of his appeal is denied as moot. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 109-110 (BIA 2009).

3

That the respondent was aware of the in absentia order as early as 2007 is evidenced by his pro se submission on July 3, 2007 of a Notice of Appeal, seeking to appeal that order directly to this Board. In an order dated August 20, 2007, we concluded that we were precluded from adjudicating the merits of the 2007 appeal in view of the requirement under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act that a motion to reopen be filed with the Immigration Judge.

4

We acknowledge the respondent’s counsel’s claim that an immigration officer informed him that he had the respondent’s file, and that he could not allow him to review it. It is unclear from the respondent’s counsel’s affidavit whether the immigration officer was referring to the Court’s record of proceedings, as counsel appears to suggest, or the Department of Homeland Security’s internal file or “A file” (Respondent’s Brief, Exh. A).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Murad Khan Ahmed, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Morocco, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s November 25, 2015, decision denying his October 22, 2015, motion to reopen removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility determinations, for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other questions de novo, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent entered the United States on September 19, 1998, as a nonimmigrant visitor, and remained longer than authorized (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). Thereafter, he was placed in removal proceedings, and on June 3, 2004, he was granted the privilege of voluntarily departing the United States pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), on or before September 30, 2004 (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). The respondent did not depart (I.J. at 2). On October 22, 2015, he filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. It was denied.
 
On appeal, the respondent does not assert that his motion is timely (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent therefore must establish that he qualifies for an exception to the generally applicable motions deadline.
 
The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request to equitably toll the motions deadline based on his former attorney’s ineffective assistance. Namely, the respondent claims that his former attorney did not timely file the visa petition through which he now seeks adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i) (Respondent’s Brief at 2-3, 7). He also contends that sua sponte reopening is appropriate, as his motion is supported by exceptional circumstances (Respondent’s Brief at 5-8).1
 
In order to equitably toll the motions filing deadline based on ineffective assistance, an alien must, among other things, demonstrate that he exercised due diligence before and after he discovered or should have discovered the ineffective assistance. Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008).
 
The respondent, however, has not established that he exercised due diligence in pursuing reopening (I.J. at 3). The respondent should have discovered his former attorney’s ineffective assistance in August 2002, when the visa petition filed by his sister on his behalf was approved (I.J. at 3; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab H).2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, he did not file his motion to reopen until October 22, 2015 (I.J. at 3).
 
*2 To the extent the respondent suggests that he was unable to exercise due diligence because he experienced depression between 2004 and 2011 (I.J. at 3; Respondent’s Brief at 4, 8; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tabs M, N), the respondent’s explanation does not account for the periods between 2002 and 2004, or between 2012 and 2015 (I.J. at 3). As such, there is an insufficient basis to conclude that he was unable to exercise due diligence during the entire period he seeks to toll (I.J. at 3).
 
Even if the respondent had exercised due diligence, we have no authority to toll the April 30, 2001, deadline imposed by section 245(i) of the Act. The statute contains a fixed cut-off date for eligibility, and it is independent of any variable. We therefore cannot toll the statutory deadline for eligibility to pursue adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See generally Balam-Chuc v. Mukasey, 547 F.3d 1044, 1047-50 (9th Cir. 2008) (affirming the Board’s finding that the deadline imposed under section 245(i) of the Act operates as a statute of repose not subject to equitable tolling).3
 
Finally, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent’s case does not warrant sua sponte reopening (I.J. at 3-4). Sua sponte reopening is invoked sparingly and reserved for truly exceptional circumstances. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-35 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). The respondent has not established that his circumstances are so exceptional as to trigger the limited authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte (I.J. at 3-4). Further, he has not demonstrated that he is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status (I.J. at 3-4). See sections 245(c)(2), (7) of the Act; section 245(i) of the Act. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Insofar as the respondent requests a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion, he must address his request directly to the Department of Homeland Security (Respondent’s Brief at 8).

2

Notably, the visa petition approval notice indicates that the petition was accorded a priority date of June 22, 2001 (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab H).

3

The respondent also claims that his former attorney’s conduct was ineffective because he advised the respondent not to depart the United States pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s grant of voluntary departure (Respondent’s Brief at 3). Nevertheless, the respondent’s failure to depart no longer acts as a bar to eligibility for discretionary relief because 10 years have passed since the entry of the voluntary departure order (Respondent’s Brief at 6). See section 240B(d)(1) of the Act. He thus has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by advice his former attorney allegedly provided relating to voluntary departure. See Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d 879, 882-83 (2d Cir. 1994).

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alexandra Rivas
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. On August 18, 2014, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On April 14, 2016, he filed an untimely motion to reopen. The respondent alleges that the time limitation should be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent contends, inter alia, that his former counsel should have disputed the charges of removability more vigorously and that he should not have been treated as an arriving alien. The respondent further argues that due to intervening precedent, his conviction is no longer an aggravated felony and he is eligible for cancellation of removal.
 
The motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel is denied as the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Although he attached a copy of a complaint to bar counsel, the motion does not include any evidence that it was actually filed (Motion, Exh. E). Further, the respondent has not demonstrated due diligence. See Avila-Santoyo v. Att’y Gen., 713 F.3d 1357, 1363 n. 5 (11th Cir. 2013) (en banc). The respondent has been aware of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, since our August 18, 2014, decision, but he still has not demonstrated compliance.
 
We will, however, grant the motion to reopen under our discretionary sua sponte power due to intervening precedent. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Donawa v. Att’y Gen., 735 F.3d 1275 (11th Cir. 2013)(conviction under section 893.13(1)(a) of Florida law does not qualify as an aggravated felony under the “drug trafficking crime” clause of section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act). Accordingly, we will remand this proceeding for further consideration of whether the respondent is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

26 I. & N. Dec. 765 (BIA), Interim Decision 3865, 2016 WL 3538417
U.S. Department of Justice
Executive Office for Immigration Review
Board of Immigration Appeals
MATTER OF ANTONIO GOMEZ-BELTRAN, RESPONDENT
Decided June 27, 2016
**1 *765 An alien cannot establish good moral character under section 101(f)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)(6) (2012), if, during the period for which it is required, he or she gives false testimony under oath in proceedings before an Immigration Judge with the subjective intent of obtaining immigration benefits.
 
FOR RESPONDENT:
Marina N. Alexandrovich, Esquire
Tempe, Arizona
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY:
Brent Landis
Senior Attorney
BEFORE: Board Panel: MALPHRUS and CREPPY, Board Members; GELLER, Temporary Board Member.
MALPHRUS, Board Member:
In a decision dated October 3, 2012, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable on his own admissions under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (2012), as an alien who is present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, and denied his applications for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1) (2012), and voluntary departure. The respondent has appealed from that decision and has filed a motion to reopen and remand. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes both the respondent’s appeal and his motion. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion will be denied.1
  
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico who last entered the United States on January 1, 2007. On his application for cancellation of removal, the respondent claimed that he had only one conviction, which *766 was on January 9, 2009, for driving under the influence. However, when he testified before the Immigration Judge, the respondent at first stated that he had never been convicted of any criminal offense. He only acknowledged the conviction after being reminded by counsel that it was listed on his application. The respondent’s attorney then asked if he had “any other arrests or convictions anywhere in the world,” to which the respondent clearly answered, “No, sir.”
 
On cross-examination, the respondent initially reaffirmed his claim that he had no other arrests or convictions. After he repeatedly denied any further criminal activity, the DHS confronted him with a series of specific dates and offenses that the respondent had not disclosed on his application.2 Even after the DHS questioned the respondent about the first of these offenses, he did not correct his prior misrepresentation or voluntarily reveal the extent of his criminal history, waiting instead until the DHS asked him about each incident. The respondent eventually admitted five additional arrests or convictions that were not included in his application and were not disclosed during the hearing until the DHS confronted him with each one.
 
**2 The Immigration Judge found that the respondent gave false testimony regarding his criminal history at the hearing and determined that he was not credible. Based on the respondent’s false testimony, the Immigration Judge concluded that he lacked good moral character under section 101(f)(6) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)(6) (2012), and was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal and voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge also denied his applications for relief in the exercise of discretion.3
  
II. ANALYSIS
  
A. Good Moral Character
 
The respondent has the burden of establishing that he meets all applicable eligibility requirements for cancellation of removal and that he merits a grant of relief in the exercise of discretion. See section 240(c)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4) (2012); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d) (2016). To qualify for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, the respondent must establish, among other things, that he has been a person of *767 good moral character for at least 10 years immediately preceding the date of his application.4 Section 240A(b)(1)(B) of the Act.
 
Section 101(f)(6) of the Act provides that no person can establish good moral character if, during the period for which it is required, he or she “has given false testimony for the purpose of obtaining any benefits” under the Act. The term “testimony” in section 101(f)(6) is limited to oral statements made under oath. Matter of L-D-E-, 8 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1959) (holding that false statements in an application do not constitute testimony). The Supreme Court has determined that the statutory bar applies to any oral statements made under oath by a person who has a subjective intent to obtain immigration benefits, regardless of whether the misrepresentation is material. Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 780 (1988) (stating that section 101(f)(6) “denominates a person to be of bad moral character on account of having given false testimony if he has told even the most immaterial of lies with the subjective intent of obtaining immigration or naturalization benefits”).
 
Immigration court proceedings are adversarial in nature and are governed by formal rules of procedure, which include requiring the Immigration Judge to take witness testimony under oath at transcribed *768 hearings. Section 240(b)(1) of the Act; Jacinto v. INS, 208 F.3d 725, 732-33 (9th Cir. 2000); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.7(b), 1240.9 (2016). False statements made under oath during proceedings before an Immigration Judge may constitute false testimony within the meaning of section 101(f)(6) of the Act. See Phinpathya v. INS, 673 F.2d 1013, 1018-19 (9th Cir. 1981) (“Testimony means a statement made by a witness under oath for the purpose of establishing proof of a fact to a court or tribunal.”), rev’d on other grounds, 464 U.S. 183 (1984); Matter of Barcenas, 19 I&N Dec. 609, 612 (BIA 1988) (finding that an alien’s false statements at a deportation hearing rendered him ineligible for voluntary departure); cf. Ramos v. INS, 246 F.3d 1264, 1266 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that false statements made in an asylum examination are “false testimony”); Bernal v. INS, 154 F.3d 1020, 1023 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that false statements made under oath in a naturalization interview are “false testimony”).
 
**3 Truthful testimony and disclosures are critical to the effective operation of the immigration court system. In the asylum context, courts have noted that the process depends on the alien’s fundamental obligation to tell the truth. Martinez v. Holder, 557 F.3d 1059, 1065 (9th Cir. 2009) (stating that the “asylum process is ultimately an honor system” and that the major check on the system is not the “[Immigration Judge’s] scrutiny or the government’s fact checkers,” but is, instead, “the asylum seeker’s belief that he or she will be held to that oath”); Diallo v. Gonzales, 447 F.3d 1274, 1280 (10th Cir. 2006) (“Asylum seekers must be held accountable for the veracity of statements that they swear to under oath.”). The same principle applies to applications for cancellation of removal.
 
In this case, the respondent testified that he had only been convicted of a single offense in 2009, denied any further incidents, and then admitted five additional arrests or convictions when confronted with each one by the DHS during cross-examination. He claims that his testimony was not untruthful because he honestly answered questions regarding specific offenses and dates and that it only appeared inconsistent when he was asked “vague, open-ended questions.”5
 
We do not agree. The questions regarding criminal history on the cancellation of removal application and at the hearing were not vague; they were simple and direct. The respondent was asked about his criminal history several times during the hearing and was given ample opportunity to disclose all his arrests and convictions before he was confronted by the *769 DHS. There is no indication that he did not understand the questions.6 Cf. United States v. Hovsepian, 422 F.3d 883, 887-88 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc) (finding no subjective intent to deceive under section 101(f)(6) of the Act where inaccuracies resulted from poor memory, mistake, or vague questioning).
 
Nor was the interpretation of the proceedings in any way faulty. The respondent made no objection regarding the interpreter at the hearing, and he has made no showing on appeal that the interpreter did not perform competently. See Matter of D-R-, 25 I&N Dec. 445, 461-62 (BIA 2011); Matter of Exilus, 18 I&N Dec. 276, 280-81 (BIA 1982). The respondent claims that the interpreter mistakenly interpreted his date of birth as May 5, instead of May 14, but there is no indication that this discrepancy had any impact on his case. Furthermore, we find no merit to the respondent’s suggestion that the DHS may have questioned him about another person’s criminal record as a result of the incorrect birth date, because the respondent admitted each arrest or conviction referred to by the DHS. The remaining interpretation errors the respondent has identified were minor and unrelated to his false testimony. See Matter of D-R-, 25 I&N Dec. at 461-62.
 
**4 Although the respondent eventually answered questions truthfully when confronted with his criminal records, this does not undermine the fact that he made false statements when initially asked about his arrests and convictions. He did not fully and voluntarily disclose his criminal history and only admitted each arrest or conviction when specifically confronted with it by the DHS. See Ramos, 246 F.3d at 1266 (stating that the petitioner’s admission to lying did not preclude a finding that she lacked good moral character because ““her later honesty . . . does not remove her from the ambit of the statute”). Therefore, the respondent did not voluntarily make a timely recantation of his false testimony. Valadez-Munoz v. Holder, 623 F.3d 1304, 1310 (9th Cir. 2010) (stating that “when a person supposedly recants only when confronted with evidence of his prevarication, the amelioration [for recantation] is not available”); Matter of Namio, 14 I&N Dec. 412, 414 (BIA 1973).
 
When asked why he did not fully disclose his criminal activities, the respondent stated only that he “did not know.” The Immigration Judge did not err in rejecting this response as unpersuasive. The respondent’s *770 explanation raises a strong inference that he made false statements with the subjective intent to prevent the Immigration Judge from considering his criminal record in determining whether he is statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal and warrants such relief as a matter of discretion. See Akwasi Agyei v. Holder, 729 F.3d 6, 16 (1st Cir. 2013) (holding that the petitioner’s false testimony about his sham marriage warranted a finding that he lacked good moral character because his unexplained “fear” of telling the truth raised the “strong inference” that he was “afraid” he would be denied adjustment of status, which “is indistinguishable from a subjective intent to obtain immigration benefits via fraud”).
 
In determining whether the evidence is sufficient to establish that an applicant gave false testimony within the meaning of section 101(f)(6) of the Act, the trier of fact must conduct a case-by-case assessment. See Hovsepian, 422 F.3d at 887 (“Whether a person has the subjective intent to deceive in order to obtain immigration benefits is a question of fact.”); see also Siewe v. Gonzales, 480 F.3d 160, 167 (2d Cir. 2007) (“Drawing inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence is a routine and necessary task of any factfinder. . . . In the immigration context, the [Immigration Judge] is the factfinder to whom this indispensable work is delegated.”); accord Matter of D-R-, 25 I&N Dec. at 454. While not every misrepresentation or omission will be sufficient to constitute false testimony under section 101(f)(6) of the Act, this is not a close case. See generally Kungys, 485 U.S. at 781 (stating that the good moral character bar does not apply to mere ““concealments”).
 
**5 We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent actively sought to mislead the court regarding the extent of his criminal history when he only admitted his 2009 conviction and denied any others in responding to clear questions that called for full disclosure. Consequently, the Immigration Judge did not clearly err in finding that the respondent made false statements under oath with a “subjective intent to deceive” for the purpose of influencing the Immigration Judge’s decision regarding his applications for relief from removal. Id. at 780-81. We therefore conclude that the Immigration Judge properly held that the respondent is precluded from establishing good moral character under section 101(f)(6) of the Act and that he is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1)(B) of the Act and for voluntary departure.7
 
*771 Moreover, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent does not merit a favorable exercise of discretion on his applications for relief from removal. See section 240(c)(4)(A)(ii) of the Act. Based on our de novo review of the record, we conclude that the respondent’s equities, which include his long residence and family ties in the United States, are outweighed by his significant criminal history and his untruthfulness during the hearing. See Aragon-Salazar v. Holder, 769 F.3d 699, 706-07 (9th Cir. 2014) (stating that the Immigration Judge can consider an applicant’s lack of truthfulness during the hearing as part of the discretionary determination on an application for relief). Accordingly, we conclude that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s applications for cancellation of removal and voluntary departure, and we will dismiss his appeal.
  
B. Motion To Remand
 
The respondent’s motion was filed during the pendency of his appeal, so it is considered to be a motion to remand. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4) (2016); see also Matter of L-V-K-, 22 I&N Dec. 976, 978-80 (BIA 1999) (discussing differences between a motion to reopen and a motion to remand in the context of an appeal). We conclude that the respondent has not demonstrated that a remand is warranted based on his newly submitted evidence and allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992); see also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127, 138 (BIA 2009) (stating that the requirements for a motion to remand are essentially the same as those for a motion to reopen).
 
First, the respondent has not substantially complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 597-99 (9th Cir. 2004). Nor has he presented a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel,” as provided under Ninth Circuit law. Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (“Lozada is intended to ensure both that an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one.”). However, even if there had been substantial compliance, the respondent has not shown that his first attorney’s performance was deficient. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310-11 (BIA 1998).
 
**6 Contrary to the respondent’s assertions, prior counsel was aware that the respondent is the beneficiary of an approved visa petition. But since his priority date was not current and no visa was immediately available to him, the respondent was not eligible to adjust his status. Furthermore, administrative closure would not have been warranted because of the *772 remote availability of a visa and the speculative nature of the respondent’s ability to adjust his status, particularly in light of his false testimony and criminal history. See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688, 696 (BIA 2012).
 
In addition, we reject the respondent’s assertion that his prior counsel was ineffective because he did not discover or disclose the respondent’s complete criminal history. The respondent admitted that he misrepresented his criminal history to his first attorney, who stated that the respondent had only informed him of the 2009 offense. The responsibility for the respondent’s false testimony, and its consequences, therefore rests on his own shoulders.
 
We find no merit to the other arguments the respondent raised in his motion regarding his ineffective assistance claim. Therefore, because the respondent has not established that prior counsel’s performance was deficient or that it adversely affected the outcome of the proceedings, we find no basis for remanding. See Lianhua Jiang v. Holder, 754 F.3d 733, 741 (9th Cir. 2014) (finding no denial of due process where the alleged violation did not affect the outcome of the proceedings); Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 857-58 (9th Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (stating that prejudice must be shown to prevail on a due process claim based on ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
Finally, although the respondent claims that he is now eligible for additional relief from removal, he has neither submitted an application nor established prima facie eligibility for any such relief. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992) (stating that a motion to reopen is properly denied when a prima facie case for the relief sought has not been established); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.
 
Footnotes

1

Subsequent to filing a brief on appeal, the respondent’s attorney moved to withdraw as counsel of record. Because no adequate basis has been shown to permit withdrawal of counsel at this late stage of the appeal, the motion is denied.

2

We note that the question on the cancellation application regarding the applicant’s criminal history is broadly worded to require full disclosure of all arrests and convictions.

3

We review the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including those relating to credibility, to determine if they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2016). We review de novo all questions of law, discretion, and judgment. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

4

The respondent’s false testimony occurred during the period in which he was required to establish good moral character. In Matter of Ortega-Cabrera, 23 I&N Dec. 793 (BIA 2005), we held that an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act is a continuing application for purposes of evaluating whether an applicant has established the required 10-year period of good moral character. In this case, the respondent provided false testimony before the Immigration Judge in June 2012, 2 years after his application was filed in May 2010, and 4 years prior to our current resolution of the matter.
In Castillo-Cruz v. Holder, 581 F.3d 1154, 1162 (9th Cir. 2009), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this case arises, cited Matter of Ortega-Cabrera and applied our approach to determining the period of good moral character for section 240A(b)(1) cancellation of removal. Moreover, other circuit courts have expressly deferred to our interpretation under Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Rodriguez-Avalos v. Holder, 788 F.3d 444, 452-55 (5th Cir. 2015); Duron-Ortiz v. Holder, 698 F.3d 523, 526-28 (7th Cir. 2012).
In Aragon-Salazar v. Holder, 769 F.3d 699, 706 n.4 (9th Cir. 2014), the Ninth Circuit held that an application for special rule cancellation of removal under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (“NACARA”), Pub. L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160, 2193 (1997), is not a continuing one for purposes of evaluating good moral character and that the required period of good moral character refers only to the 7 years immediately preceding the filing of the application. The court declined to follow Castillo-Cruz, finding that it arose “in a different context.” Id. We conclude that Castillo-Cruz continues to be controlling in the context of applications for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act.

5

The respondent may have been confused by the use of the term ““departure” during a line of questioning concerning his entries and departures. However, in finding that the respondent gave false testimony, the Immigration Judge did not appear to rely on this possible inconsistency, and we have not considered it in reviewing his decision.

6

The respondent was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings, and there were no indicia of incompetency. See Matter of M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 474, 477 (BIA 2011) (stating that “an alien is presumed to be competent” and that “absent indicia of mental incompetency, an Immigration Judge is under no obligation to analyze an alien’s competency”).

7

Since the respondent has not established good moral character, we need not address the Immigration Judge’s determination that he did not meet his burden to prove the requisite hardship under section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act. See INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25 (1976) (stating that “courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach”).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrew Park, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The final order of removal in these proceedings was entered by the Board on September 18, 2014, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent filed an untimely and number-barred motion to reopen his proceedings on May 19, 2016. See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent does not dispute the untimeliness of his motion, but alleges ineffective assistance of counsel and requests that the Board exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen his proceedings in the interests of justice. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent has submitted evidence that the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Orange, has allowed the respondent to withdraw his guilty plea and vacated his 2014 conviction for possession for sale of marijuana in violation of California Health and Safety Code Section 11359 and allowed him to plead guilty to accessory to a crime, a felony in violation of Penal Code section 32 (Supplement to Motion to Reopen filed on June 7, 2016, at Tabs 3-5). Now the respondent has presented evidence indicating that his prior conviction was vacated because the plea procedures did not comply with CPL§ 440 (see Motion at attachments, Supplement to Motion to Reopen at Tabs 3-4). See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003) (holding that a conviction that has been vacated by the criminal court based upon a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings is no longer a conviction for immigration purposes); see also Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010) (holding that a criminal lawyer representing a non-citizen in connection with a guilty plea has a constitutional duty to advise the defendant that conviction may pose a risk of deportation).
 
Under the circumstances, we will reopen the proceedings on our own motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We express no opinion on the outcome of the case. On remand, the Immigration Judge may receive any additional evidence she deems appropriate to the full resolution of this matter. Accordingly, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the respondent’s removability and if necessary, any eligibility for relief from removal.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mary H. Berlanga, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s June 19, 2015, decision denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings held in absentia on May 14, 2015. The Department of Homeland Security has not opposed the appeal, which will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Upon de novo review, we affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. On appeal, the respondent reiterates that he did not receive notice of his hearing. He states that he did not receive a notice of hearing at the address he provided to the court, and therefore was unaware of the May 14, 2015, hearing. The record reflects that the Notice to Appear was served personally on the respondent on December 6, 2013, and that he received oral notice in the Spanish language and written notice of the the consequences of failing to appear at his removal hearings (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). On January 6, 2014, attorney Ronald Higgins entered an appearance on behalf of the respondent (I.J. at 1). On January 7, 2014, attorney Avia Castillo-Garza entered an appearance on behalf of the respondent (I.J. at 1). The Immigration Court mailed both Mr. Higgins and Ms. Castillo-Garza a hearing notice for the respondent’s May 14, 2015, removal hearing (I.J. at 1). There is no evidence in the record indicating that the notice of hearing was returned to the immigration court as undeliverable.
 
Based on the foregoing, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent received proper notice inasmuch as written notice of his hearing was provided to his attorneys of record. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (finding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (providing that whenever a person is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to the attorney or representative of record, or to the person himself if unrepresented). To the extent the respondent asserts that his former attorneys provided ineffective assistance of counsel, he did not establish such a claim. The respondent did not comply with the procedural requirements for filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as enunciated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 Moreover, to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for purposes of reopening, the respondent must demonstrate that he was substantially prejudiced by his former counsels’ performance. See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). Proving prejudice requires that the respondent make a prima facie showing that, absent counsels’ deficient performance, he would have been entitled to the relief he sought. See Miranda-Lores v. INS, 12 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994) (citation omitted). However, the respondent has not provided any applications for relief or established that he is prima facie eligible for any form of relief from removal. The fact of Mr. Higgins’s resignation of his law license does not, in and of itself, constitute ineffective assistance of counsel in this case such that the respondent suffered prejudice as a result of his representation.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Murray D. Hilts, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John D. Holliday
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 5, 2014, decision denying her motion to reopen removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, under a clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The following facts are not in dispute. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, entered the United States on or about May 1985 (I.J. at 1; Application for Cancellation of removal (Form EOIR-42A) at 2). The respondent was granted temporary resident status on February 1, 1989, and adjusted her status to that of lawful permanent resident (LPR) on March 5, 1993 (I.J. at 1; Exh. 2; Resp. Motion to Reopen at 24). On June 25, 1997, the respondent was issued a Notice to Appear charging her with removability under section 212(a)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C), as an alien the Attorney General knows or has reason to believe is an illicit trafficker in a controlled substance (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). On November 14, 1997, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and denied her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) (I.J. at 2; Order of the Immigration Judge, dated Nov. 14, 1997). The respondent did not appeal that decision (I.J. at 1). The respondent was removed to Mexico, and she unlawfully re-entered to the United States soon thereafter (Resp. Brief at 4).
 
On February 10, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, arguing that ineffective assistance of prior counsel prevented her from pursuing an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act (I.J. at 2; Resp.’s Motion to Reopen). Specifically, she asserts that under Ortega de Robles v. INS, 58 F.3d 1355 (9th Cir. 1995)--which held that an LPR could include time spent as a lawful temporary resident to establish the requisite 7 years of lawful unrelinquished domicile for former section 212(c) relief--she had established 7 years of continuous residence for section 240A(a) relief at the time of her removal hearing (Resp. Brief at 7-10). Her prior counsel’s “failure to keep abreast” of Ortega de Robles v. INS, supra, amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel (Resp. Brief at 7-10). The Immigration Judge denied reopening, concluding that the respondent had not shown that she was prejudiced by prior counsel’s assistance (I.J. at 3-4). See Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 587 (9th Cir. 2011); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, with the following notations. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). At the time of the respondent’s removal hearing in 1997, neither the Board nor the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had held that an LPR could include time spent as a lawful temporary resident to establish 7 years of continuous residence for cancellation of removal (I.J. at 4). The respondent’s reliance on Ortega de Robles v. INS, supra, is misplaced as that case addressed eligibility for former section 212(c) relief and was issued 2 years before cancellation of removal existed as a benefit. See Matter of Abdelghany, 26 I&N Dec. 254, 257 n.6 (BIA 2014) (explaining that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (effective April 1, 1997) eliminated former section 212(c) relief and created cancellation of removal). Thus, contrary to the respondent’s appellate assertion, there is no “““clear[] conflict” between Board precedent at the time of the respondent’s removal hearing and prior counsel’s concession that the respondent did not have the requisite 7 years of continuous residence (Resp. Brief at 10). As noted by the Immigration Judge, the Board did not hold that admission as a temporary resident could be counted toward the residency requirement for cancellation of removal until 2 years after the respondent’s removal hearing (I.J. at 4). See Matter of Perez, 22 I&N Dec. 689, 692 (BIA 1999).
 
The respondent argues that her prior counsel should have argued that the holding in Ortega de Robles v. INS, supra, regarding lawful domicile for former section 212(c) purposes applied to continuous residence for section 240A(a) purposes (Resp. Brief at 6-8). Given the unsettled nature of the law at that time of the respondent’s removal hearing, we agree that prior counsel did not commit ineffective assistance of counsel by conceding the respondent’s ineligibility for cancellation of removal (I.J. at 4-5). Moreover, we agree with the Immigration Judge that respondent did not establish prejudice, as the law was unsettled at that time. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899-90 (9th Cir. 2003) (explaining that prejudice results when “the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings”) (internal citation or quotation marks omitted).
 
Finally, considering the totality of the circumstances presented and alleged, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances sufficient to justify exercising his discretionary authority to reopen the respondent’s removal proceedings sua sponte (I.J. at 4-5; Resp. Brief at 10). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard Joseph Link, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michele Henriques
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)] - Convicted of crime involving moral turpitude
 
 
APPLICATION: Termination
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s December 1, 2015, decision denying his motion to terminate these removal proceedings. See Matter of G-N-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 281 (BIA 1998) (discussing Immigration Judge’s obligation to weigh the merits of a motion to terminate filed by the Department of Homeland Security after a charging document is filed and jurisdiction has vested with the Immigration Court). The Department of Homeland Security has offered a statement of non-opposition to this appeal. The appeal will be sustained and the proceedings will be terminated.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was charged with removability pursuant to the above-listed charge. Prior to the commencement of these proceedings, the criminal court granted the respondent’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea to the underlying offense. See Motion Tabs A-C. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s unopposed motion to terminate the removal proceedings, finding that “it appears that the vacatur was entered solely [sic] for the basis of avoiding immigration consequences and not vacated on the merits of the (underlying) charge.” See Immigration Judge’s Decision at 3.
 
In Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003), the Board held that if a criminal court vacates an alien’s conviction for reasons solely related to rehabilitation or immigration hardships, rather than on the basis of a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the conviction is not eliminated for immigration purposes. Both parties to these proceedings argued before the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s attorney in his criminal case rendered ineffective assistance of counsel when advising him of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea. See Transcript of the Proceedings at 6-8, 16, 19-20. On appeal, the respondent asserts that the vacatur was based on ineffective assistance of counsel and both parties argue that termination of the removal proceedings would not contravene the holding in Matter of Pickering, supra.
 
*2 While the December 18, 2013, decision of the criminal court resulted in the vacatur of the respondent’s conviction to enable him to replead and avoid the immigration consequences of his initial plea agreement, upon review of the evidence before the Immigration Judge, it is clear that the vacatur was based, at least in part, on the finding that the respondent’s defense attorney rendered ineffective assistance by providing the respondent with incorrect advice regarding the risk of removal arising from his December 7, 2012, plea agreement. See Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 369 (2010). The criminal court’s October 18, 2013, decision vacating the conviction was not entered “““solely” to enable the respondent to avoid the immigration consequences of his conviction. The criminal court’s decision was also entered to correct a procedural defect in the criminal proceedings whereby the respondent was provided improper legal advice regarding the immigration consequences of his guilty plea prior to entering the plea. Accordingly the respondent’s appeal will be sustained, and the motion to terminate will be granted.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to terminate the removal proceedings is granted and the proceedings are terminated.

File: AXXX XX2 312 - Boston, MA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lawrence Gatei, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; termination
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic. On June 26, 2012, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his request for a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief and ordering his removal. Subsequent to our decision, the respondent was removed to the Dominican Republic (Respondent’s Motion at 2, 4). On March 1, 2016, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and terminate proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a response to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent claims that the conviction which formed the basis for the Immigration Judge’s removal order was vacated for immigration purposes (Respondent’s Motion at 1-5). In this regard, the respondent submits state court records which indicate that, on April 7, 2014, a Massachusetts criminal court vacated his 2009 conviction for knowingly or intentionally manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing cocaine and for knowingly or intentionally possessing cocaine pursuant to Chapter 94C, Sections 32A(a) and 34 of the Massachusetts General Laws (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab B). The respondent asserts that these documents constitute previously unavailable material evidence and requests that proceedings be reopened pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) and terminated (Respondent’s Motion at 3-4, 6).
 
The decision in these proceedings became final on June 26, 2012, when the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(7). With certain exceptions not pertinent here, a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before September 24, 2012. The motion to reopen was not filed until March 1, 2016, and the respondent has not articulated any basis for equitable tolling of the statutory time limitation (Respondent’s Motion). See Xin Qiang Liu v. Lynch, 802 F.3d 69, 75 (1st Cir. 2015); Neves v. Holder, 613 F.3d 30, 36-37 (1st Cir. 2010). Thus, the respondent’s motion to reopen based on previously unavailable material evidence is denied as untimely.
 
*2 The respondent also requests that we exercise our discretionary authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte in light of his vacated conviction (Respondent’s Motion at 1, 4-6). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The respondent bears the burden of proof to establish the reason the conviction was vacated. Rumierz v. Gonzales, 456 F.3d 31 (1st Cir. 2006); Matter of Chavez, 24 I&N Dec. 272 (BIA 2007). A conviction vacated under a rehabilitative statute or to avoid the immigration consequences of the conviction, remains a conviction for immigration purposes. See Herrera-Inirio v. I.N.S., 208 F.3d 299, 306 (1st Cir. 2000); Matter of Marroquin-Garcia, 23 I&N Dec. 705, 713-17 (A.G. 2005); Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). A conviction vacated by a criminal court based upon a procedural or substantive defect is no longer a conviction for immigration purposes. See Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006); Matter of Pickering, supra.
 
The documents attached to the respondent’s motion include a criminal docket and handwritten docket entries related to the respondent’s 2009 conviction (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab B). The docket entries indicate that the respondent filed two motions to vacate his conviction with the criminal court, both of which were denied (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab B). The docket entries also indicate that two motions to reconsider were filed and that hearings were held with respect to the respondent’s requests for post-conviction relief. The last entry in the docket states, “Case Nolle Pressed all fees and fines remitted” (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab B). Copies of the transcript and the motions referenced in the docket entries were not provided.
 
The respondent, through counsel, asserts that his motion to vacate his conviction was based on a constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and evidence tampering (Respondent’s Motion at 2). However, uncorroborated declarations of counsel are not evidence and we are unable to discern the basis for the vacatur of the respondent’s conviction based on the record before us. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 505-06 (BIA 1980). As the respondent has not presented evidence sufficient to establish the basis for the criminal court’s order, he has not met his burden of proof. See Rumierz v. Gonzales, supra; Matter of Chavez, supra. Moreover, the respondent has not established that he acted with diligence by filing his motion to reopen nearly two years after his conviction was vacated. Lastly, the respondent has not established that exceptional circumstances which warrant sua sponte reopening otherwise exist in his case (Respondent’s Motion at 2-3).1
 
*3 In light of the foregoing, we decline to exercise our discretionary authority to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, supra, at 976 (holding that the Board’s sua sponte authority is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to circumvent the time limits where enforcing them might otherwise cause hardship); see also Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 112 (BIA 2009). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and terminate is denied.

We acknowledge the family ties referenced by the respondent in his motion (Respondent’s Motion at 2-3). However, the hardship caused by separation from family members is not an exceptional situation which warrants sua sponte reopening. See Matter of J-J-, supra; see also Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2009).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a motion requesting the Board reconsider our decision of March 8, 2016, in which we affirmed the denial of his first untimely motion to reopen. The respondent also again seeks reopening with the submission of additional evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). As a motion to reconsider, this motion is timely filed. Insofar as the respondent seeks reopening, this motion is untimely and number-barred. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The record does not contain a response from the Department of Homeland Security. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must identify a material error of fact or law in the decision for which reconsideration is being requested. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). The respondent argues that his prior motion should have been construed as a “statutorily authorized” motion to reopen, notwithstanding that it was untimely filed. In support of this argument, the respondent relies on an interpretation of the term “sua sponte” which is limited to circumstances in which the Board chooses to reopen proceedings in the absence of a motion from the parties (Motion to Reconsider and Reopen at 6-11). He contends that if his motion was “statutorily authorized,” and not subject to reopening under “sua sponte” discretionary authority provided for in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), then the limitation on our discretionary authority in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) does not apply.
 
We are not persuaded of any material error in the Board’s decision of March 8, 2016. First, the respondent relies solely on a narrow reading of the phrase “““on its own motion” in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), which ignores the proviso that the Board may reopen “at any time.” The phrase “at any time” is inclusive of times when the Board is ruling on a motion from the parties. The respondent does not cite any authority for his interpretation of the Board’s authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Moreover, as the respondent acknowledges, the respondent’s interpretation directly contradicts not only Board precedent but also relevant circuit court authority (Motion at 9-11). See Ovalles v. Holder, 577 F.3d 288 (5th Cir. 2009); Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, 330 F.3d 672 (5th Cir. 2003); see also Garcia-Carias v. Holder, 697 F.3d 257, 265 (5th Cir. 2012).
 
*2 Further, the respondent ignores that on appeal the Board was not interpreting our own authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), but rather the Immigration Judge’s authority to do so under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). While these regulatory provisions are generally interpreted in an identical fashion with respect to sua sponte reopening, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) is explicit that an Immigration Judge’s authority to reopen sua sponte may be utilized “upon his or her own motion at any time, or upon motion of the Service or the alien” (emphasis added). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
Finally, if the respondent’s argument were accepted it would require the mandatory denial of his motion to reopen on the basis of untimeliness. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act contains an explicit timeliness limitation on motions to reopen. For those motions such as the respondent’s which do not fall within a statutorily authorized exception from the time limits, the regulatory authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte represents the sole mechanism by which the motion could be granted. For these reasons, the respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.
 
The respondent also seeks to present additional evidence to cure defects in the prior motion, and to that end this motion constitutes an untimely, second motion to reopen. Specifically, the Board previously noted that the respondent’s motion to remand on appeal did not comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent’s current motion seeks to remedy that deficiency by submitting evidence of compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
As alternatively noted by the Board in our decision of March 8, 2016, the respondent has not set forth a viable argument for ineffective assistance. The respondent has alleged equitable tolling was warranted because prior counsel did seek equitable tolling in the respondent’s first untimely motion. However, he has not explained why competent counsel would have sought equitable tolling in his first motion to reopen.1 Equitable tolling is ordinarily reserved for circumstances in which a party is actively misled or in which ineffective assistance of counsel prejudiced an alien and prevented a timely filing of an application or motion. See, e.g., Ott v. Johnson, 192 F.3d 510, 513 (5th Cir. 1999). The respondent, by contrast, was seeking reopening based on an intervening change in law, which does not constitute a basis for equitable tolling. See Matter of X-G-W-, 22 I&N Dec. 71 (BIA 1998); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999). To the extent that the respondent seeks sua sponte reopening based on an intervening change in law, we construe the departure bar in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) as a limitation on our discretionary authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte.
 
*3 Finally, we note that the respondent has not shown he would no longer be found removable even if we reopened proceedings. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). The respondent references United States v. Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d 921 (5th Cir. 2001), which did hold that convictions for driving under the influence do not establish removability for an aggravated felony crime of violence (Motion at 2-3). However, the respondent had also conceded removability under section 237(a)(2)(E)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), and the respondent does not allege that he is no longer removable on that basis.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

Respondent has submitted a letter from prior counsel which acknowledges that he did not seek equitable tolling in the first motion. However, the letter does not suggest prior counsel admitted to rendering ineffective assistance, as respondent claims, as the letter does not suggest that prior counsel was deficient for having not done so (Motion at 3-4; Motion, Tab A, at 7).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert Gordon Berke, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on March 29, 2002, after not appearing at a hearing. She filed a motion to reopen on October 17, 2014, and she appeals from the Immigration Judge’s December 12, 2014, decision denying the motion. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that exceptional circumstances, to wit, ineffective assistance of counsel, prevented her from appearing at her hearing. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) (providing that a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal); Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672 (9th Cir. 2011) (requiring for equitable tolling that an alien acted with “due” or “reasonable” diligence in discovering any “deception, fraud, or error” that prevented an alien from timely filing a motion). In her declaration, the respondent states that she appeared at her hearing with her former counsel, and she was informed by the Immigration Court that she would receive her Notice of Hearing by mail. However, the Notice of Hearing reflects that the respondent was personally served on February 15, 2002. In addition, the respondent states that a year passed, and she did not hear either from her former attorney or the court. She states that she attempted to contact her former attorney via telephone, was unable to reach him, and discovered in 2013 that she had been ordered removed from the United States in absentia. Notwithstanding her personal service of the Notice of Hearing and whether she satisfied the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has not explained why she did not immediately inquire about her immigration status with the Immigration Court or another attorney after she was unable to make contact with her former attorney. In light of the respondent’s lack of due diligence, we decline to equitably toll the 180-day for filing her motion to reopen, and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny it as untimely filed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Amy L. Velasquez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Nicaragua, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated February 9, 2016, denying his request for a continuance and ordering his removal from the United States. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent does not dispute that he is subject to removal from the United States because he is an alien who is present in this country without being admitted or paroled by an immigration officer or who arrived at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General (I.J. at 1-2; Exh. 1). See section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). Moreover, he does not contend that, at the present time, he is eligible for any form of relief from removal which can be granted by an Immigration Judge or this Board. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.1(a)(1) (enumerating many of the forms of relief from removal which can be granted by an Immigration Judge). For example, on appeal, the respondent concedes that his conviction for sexual battery precludes him from establishing eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1) (Respondent’s Br. at 4). The respondent has declined to apply for voluntary departure (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 8).
 
Despite the absence of an express opposition from the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), the respondent did not establish that there was “good cause” for a continuance of these removal proceedings (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 1240.6. While the respondent, through counsel, claimed that he had contacted an attorney to file for post-conviction relief, he did not present any evidence that he had actually filed for post-conviction relief with the appropriate state court (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 8-9). See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (recognizing that the statements of counsel are not evidence). Overall, considering the speculative nature of the outcome of the respondent’s yet-to-be filed post-conviction relief claim and the absence of any evidence that such a claim would be filed in the near future, it was appropriate for the Immigration Judge to conclude these removal proceedings by denying the respondent’s request for a continuance and ordering his removal from the United States. See Matter of Sanchez Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 815 (BIA 2012) (recognizing that a continuance should not be granted where it is being sought “as a dilatory tactic to forestall the conclusion of removal proceedings”); cf. Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009) (holding that a continuance may be warranted where an alien has demonstrated that he is the beneficiary of a pending immigrant visa petition and established a likelihood of success on an application for adjustment of status).
 
*2 The respondent has also not established that he was prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his request for a continuance and enter an order of removal. See Lapaix v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 605 F.3d 1138, 1143 (11th Cir. 2010); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983). Notwithstanding the respondent’s aforementioned conviction for sexual battery, he is otherwise subject to removal from the United States as charged in the Notice to Appear. Moreover, the respondent has not shown that, if his conviction was vacated, the outcome of these proceedings would likely be different, i.e., he would have been granted relief from removal.1 See Ibrahim v. INS, 821 F.2d 1547, 1550 (11th Cir. 1987). In particular, the respondent has not established that, if his conviction was vacated, he would likely succeed on the merits of a claim to cancellation of removal. While, through counsel, the respondent contends that “life has become extremely difficult” for his family, he has not presented any evidence which establishes that his removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. See section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act; Matter of Monreal, 23 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2001) (holding that to establish “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship,” an applicant for cancellation of removal must demonstrate that his or his qualifying relative would suffer hardship that is substantially beyond that which would ordinarily be expected to result from the alien’s deportation).
 
Finally, the respondent has not established that the record should be remanded to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the evidence that he has presented on appeal. The respondent, who contends that his conviction for battery was the result of a consensual encounter with a man, has presented evidence that, subsequent to the Immigration Judge’s entry of the order of removal, he filed for post-conviction relief based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and other constitutional defects in his criminal proceedings. See generally Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010); Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238 (1969). However, despite the filing of a claim to post-conviction relief, his conviction remains final for immigration purposes. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323 (BIA 1996); Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992). Overall, considering the lack of evidence which establishes that the respondent is otherwise prima facie eligible for relief from removal, we are not persuaded that, if the record was remanded, the respondent’s speculative eligibility for post-conviction relief and, in turn, eligibility for cancellation of removal would be shown to amount to “good cause” for a continuance. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (holding that a party seeking a remand must establish that, if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were remanded, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case).
 
*3 For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s request for a continuance and order his removal from the United States to Nicaragua. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

While, on appeal, the respondent refers to being a “category one enforcement priority,” the classification of an alien by the DHS is not subject to review by this Board. See Matter of Fede, 20 I&N Dec. 35, 36-37 (BIA 1989). As such, we do not deem the potential loss of an opportunity to be deemed a lower enforcement priority by the DHS’s internal classification procedures to amount to prejudice warranting remanded proceedings. If the respondent believes that he should not be removed from the United States, he is not precluded from requesting a stay of removal from the DHS. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.6.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey A. Devore, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Collin Schueler
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was before the Board on December 7, 2015, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion to remand on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent filed this motion to reopen proceedings on March 7, 2016, again alleging ineffective assistance. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion.
 
As we stated in our prior order, the appeal brief and motion to remand did not document that the respondent is eligible for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Accordingly, prejudice resulting from ineffective assistance of counsel was not shown. The present motion includes documents that were neither offered at the hearing nor included with the respondent’s previous motion to remand. The motion states that “counsel was in possession of evidence which the [r]espondent had provided” (Mot. at 3), but does not specify the evidence or explain why it was not provided with the previous motion.
 
The documents submitted with the present motion do not establish the respondent’s continuous physical presence in the United States so as to be eligible for TPS. Only one document dates from before March 9, 2001, and that document merely evidences the respondent’s presence on a particular date and does not establish continuous presence. See Mot., Tab C. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (“A motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing [.]”). As the respondent’s evidence does not demonstrate eligibility for relief, prejudice has not been established. Further, as noted, the respondent has not explained why the evidence now offered for the first time was not previously presented, including with the motion to remand. For these reasons, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Arthur Campbell Cooke, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Iran, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s August 4, 2015, decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a brief in opposition to the appeal. Proceedings will be reopened and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel such that his proceedings should be reopened. The Immigration Judge acknowledged that the respondent’s previous counsel did not file the application for relief from removal - specifically, cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) - within the time frame the Immigration Judge had set (I.J. at 1). However, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent’s own acts contributed to his counsel not filing the application, and therefore, he had not demonstrated that ineffective assistance had prejudiced the outcome of proceedings (I.J. at 2).
 
Upon our de novo review, we determine that the respondent’s proceedings merit reopening. We first note that the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed jointly with the DHS (I.J. at 1). Further, as noted above, the DHS has not filed an opposition to the respondent’s current appeal. Second, the respondent has met the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (I.J. at 2). The respondent’s previous counsel was aware of the filing deadline and did not file the cancellation application within the time frame set by the Immigration Judge or withdraw her representation of the respondent (I.J. at 1).
 
Thus, while we acknowledge the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent was afforded an opportunity to apply for relief, we do not agree that the application was waived, when the respondent affirmatively hired counsel to file the application, and counsel neglected to do so. Finally, the respondent is prima facie eligible for relief from removal and has submitted the relevant application. See Joint Motion to Reopen Proceedings filed June 15, 2015. Under the totality of the circumstances, we agree that the respondent’s proceedings merit reopening and the record should be remanded to the Immigration Judge for a hearing on the respondent’s eligibility for relief from removal under section 240A(a) of the Act. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

May 19, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Chunyu Jean Wang, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 On January 14, 2016, the respondent submitted her third motion to reopen proceedings in which the Board dismissed her appeal on August 16, 2004. The motion will be denied.
 
To the extent that the respondent suggests that the Board committed error in not addressing issues relating to the Immigration Judge’s conduct of the hearing, this aspect of her motion is in the nature of one seeking reconsideration. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Whether treated as a motion to reopen or reconsider, the respondent’s motion is untimely, and as a motion to reopen it is also number-barred as it is her third such motion. Sections 240(c)(6), (7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6), (7); 8 C.F.R. § § 1003.2(b), (c)(2).
 
The respondent contends that reopening and/or reconsideration is nonetheless appropriate in light of misconduct on the part of the Immigration Judge, and as her first attorney gave her erroneous legal advice, preventing her from pursuing derivative asylee status. The respondent also asserts that other attorneys failed to raise or address the issues she now cites in her motion. As she avers that she experienced a gross miscarriage of justice and her due process rights were violated, she asks that proceedings be sua sponte reopened. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
However, the substantive basis for the respondent’s motion is that she was provided ineffective assistance by the numerous attorneys1 who have previously represented her in these proceedings. Despite this assertion, the respondent has not complied, even substantially, with any of the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against any of her various former counsels. Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133, 143 (2d Cir. 2007); Twum v. INS, 411 F.3d 54 (2d Cir. 2005); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). She correctly notes that her first attorney, who prepared her asylum application, was later disbarred (and was expelled from practicing before this Board on May 6, 2002). However, this fact alone does not exempt the respondent from any compliance with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against him or any of her other former attorneys.
 
*2 In this regard we note that her first attorney never appeared in person before the Immigration Judge on the respondent’s behalf. While an associate at his firm did appear on one occasion, that hearing was continued, and the merits of the respondent’s asylum claim were not reached (Tr. at 6-11). Thereafter the respondent appeared with other counsel, not associated with her first attorney’s law firm, with the Immigration Judge noting at the February 15, 2001, hearing that her first attorney had been arrested. Neither he nor anyone from his law firm was representing the respondent at the time of her merits hearing on April 28, 2003. Rather, the respondent had three other attorneys appear on her behalf during the remainder of her hearings (Tr. at 14, 30, 48, 58, 61). The respondent was also represented by three different attorneys during the course of her appeal and two prior motions to reopen. As such, the fact that her first attorney and/or his office was involved at the outset of the respondent’s case does not establish he was ineffective per se and does not excuse her failure to comply with any of the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against any of her subsequent former representatives. Therefore, reopening on this basis is not warranted.
 
As noted, the aspect of the respondent’s motion arguing a gross miscarriage of justice relative to the former-Immigration Judge’s handling of her case is in the nature of one seeking reconsideration. It is untimely by more than a decade. Section 240(c)(6) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). As indicated above, to the extent that the respondent avers that former counsel erred by not raising this issue, she has not complied with the requirements for reopening on such a basis. Twum v. INS, supra. The respondent has not identified any exceptional circumstance preventing her from such compliance, or which otherwise supports sua sponte reopening or reconsideration of her proceedings. Matter of G-D-, supra at 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (“As a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.”); Matter of J-J-, supra.
 
We further do not find that this case presents a gross miscarriage of justice as alleged by the respondent. We do not condone either the tone or non-judicious comments of the Immigration Judge. However, as the Board specifically declined to join in the Immigration Judge’s frivolous finding, the respondent was not precluded from pursuing adjustment of status, contrary to her arguments otherwise.
 
This case is also distinguishable from the situation presented in Matter of Farinas, 12 I&N Dec. 467, 471-72 (BIA 1967), wherein we found a gross miscarriage of justice. In that case the respondent’s deportation order, which was valid when entered, became invalid by virtue of controlling circuit precedent issued prior to the execution of the order. We further note that another case, Matter of Malone, 11 I&N Dec. 730, 731-32 (BIA 1966), also finding gross miscarriage of justice, is distinct from the respondent’s case as that respondent’s deportation order was clearly not in accord with the law as interpreted at the time of issuance. Neither of these situations is present here. Also, unlike those cases, the respondent’s arguments are largely premised on various claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Both the circuit where this case arises and the Board have clear precedential authority regarding the requirements for such claims, and the respondent has made no effort to comply with any of the same, nor explained why no action has been taken in this regard.
 
*3 As such, we find that the respondent’s motion is not exempt from the noted statutory bars, and the exercise of our sua sponte authority is not warranted. Therefore, we find that neither reopening nor reconsideration is warranted. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
AL Kola, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alexandra Kostich
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 20, 2015, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his October 14, 2014, removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
In his motion to reopen, which was not accompanied by an affidavit, the respondent alleged that his failure to appear resulted because he mistook the hearing date, believing it was on December 15, 2014. The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, finding that the respondent’s confusion regarding his hearing date did not constitute exceptional circumstances beyond his control that would excuse his failure to appear. See Uriostegui v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 660 (7th Cir. 2005) (concluding that mishearing the date uttered by the interpreter was nowhere near the illustrative examples of exceptional circumstances given in the statute).
 
On appeal, the respondent now alleges lack of notice and also avers that his prior attorney never informed the respondent of his court date. The respondent did not assert lack of notice in his motion to reopen, and he has not proffered an affidavit or explained why lack of notice was not previously alleged. Counsel’s arguments are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980).
 
*2 Ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an exceptional circumstance that excuses an alien’s failure to appear and allows reopening of the removal proceedings and rescission of a removal order. Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472, 473-74 (BIA 1996). However, the alien must satisfy the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988) for claiming ineffectiveness of counsel. Specifically, the alien must: “(1) submit an affidavit establishing that she had an agreement with counsel to represent her and detailing its terms; (2) present evidence that she has given notice to her counsel of the ineffectiveness claim and an opportunity to respond to the allegations, and include any response she has received; and (3) if the attorney violated his ethical or legal obligations, show that she has filed a complaint with the governing disciplinary authorities or explain why she has not done so.” Lin Xing Jiang v. Holder, 639 F.3d 751, 755 (7th Cir. 2011) (citing Matter of Lozada). Satisfying the Lozada requirements “““is a necessary condition to obtaining reopening on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.” Id.
 
Here, the respondent has not identified who his prior attorney was. Nor has he fulfilled any of the requirements necessary for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, supra. Consequently, reopening on this basis is not warranted. See, e.g., Ghaffar v. Mukasey, 551 F.3d 651, 656 (7th Cir. 2008) (“Ghaffar did not comply with any of the Lozada requirements. Consequently, the Board acted well within its rights to deny his motion for remand”); Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498, 504 (7th Cir. 2001) (“[W]e have difficulty understanding how an alien who fails to comply with the Board’s criteria can succeed in challenging its decision”).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Blake Doughty
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent filed a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s December 2, 2015, decision. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion, and the entry of a new decision.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, and the likelihood of future events, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015; Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in an appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The sole issue presented on appeal is a due process challenge to the Immigration Judge’s conduct of the proceedings by failing to continue the proceedings to allow the respondent to appear with the counsel of his choice.
 
The record reflects that when the respondent first appeared before the Immigration Judge at a master calendar hearing on November 12, 2015, the Immigration Judge continued the proceedings for 6 days, until November 18, 2015, to allow the respondent to appear with counsel. On that date, the respondent appeared with counsel, at which time the pleadings were taken (Tr. at 31). Respondent’s counsel indicated that respondent would likely seek cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The Immigration Judge (Tr. at 31) continued the proceedings for one week, until November 25, 2015, for the filing of all applications for relief from removal, admonishing the respondent and his attorney that if not filed by that time they would be deemed abandoned. At the reconvened proceedings, no applications were submitted. The respondent’s counsel claimed (Tr. at 33) that he had not prepared any applications for relief because respondent’s wife had told him his “services would no longer be required.” This was contrary to the respondent’s explanation to the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 33) that his wife had told him that his attorney no longer wanted to represent him. Respondent’s counsel (Tr. at 34) sought clarify the communication he had with respondent’s wife claiming he had advised them that “““there was very little likelihood that [the respondent] can prevail on any kind of application,” notwithstanding the substantial equities supporting the respondent’s request, because “a cancellation of removal is very difficult to win.” The Immigration Judge continued the case until December 2, 2015, for the filing of all applications for relief, noting that as respondent’s counsel had yet to submit a motion to withdraw, he continued to represent the respondent (and not his wife) in these proceedings. A week later at the reconvened proceedings, when no applications were filed, respondent’s counsel told the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 40) that he thought respondent’s newly-retained counsel would appear and file the application for cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge (Tr. at 40) rejected that explanation, noting that as no new Notice of Appearance (Form EOIR-28) had been filed with the Immigration Court by any other attorney on behalf of the respondent, he still continued to represent him as the attorney of record. The Immigration Judge proceeded to find all applications for relief abandoned for failure to timely file and ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States.
 
*2 We note that all applications and related documents that are to be considered in a proceeding before an Immigration Judge must be filed with the Immigration Court having administrative control over the record of proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(a). The regulations provide that if an application or supportive documentation is not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application shall be deemed waived. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.31(c); Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992) (“The Board has long held that applications for benefits under the Act are properly denied as abandoned when the alien fails to timely file them.”); Matter of Jean, 17 I&N Dec. 100 (BIA 1979). Failure to file necessary documentation or to meet security and biometric requirements also “constitutes abandonment of the application” unless the applicant demonstrates “good cause” for such failure. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.47(c).
 
We acknowledge the regulations allow an Immigration Judge to find the respondent’s failure to submit his application for relief from removal within the time set to constitute an abandonment of the application. However, that decision must be balanced against the due process concerns of ensuring the respondent has a full and fair hearing. The respondent’s entire immigration proceedings before the Immigration Judge commenced and were concluded in less than 3 weeks. The record clearly reflects that the continued representation of the respondent by said attorney was not viewed favorably by either party, and the record indicates the respondent was in the process of obtaining new legal representation. The outcome of the respondent’s case was clearly prejudiced by said attorney’s actions, i.e., his failure to timely submit the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal.1
 
Consequently, we find that under the particular circumstances of this case, in order to ensure the respondent’s right to a full and fair hearing, a remand is appropriate to allow the respondent to appear represented by his newly-retained counsel, who could then properly file the necessary application for relief from removal.
 
Accordingly, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, and the entry of a new decision.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, and the entry of a new decision.

Although the respondent was clearly prejudiced by the failure to timely file the application for relief from removal, we do not find it necessary at this juncture to determine whether the actions (or inaction) of said attorney constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals the Immigration Judge’s February 2, 2016, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On January 16, 2015, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed and the respondent waived appeal. On February 1, 2016, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a motion to reopen, requesting sua sponte reopening of proceedings to allow the respondent to apply for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”) (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2-3). The respondent also stated that he may raise a claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel, after obtaining additional information (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 4, fn 3). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposed reopening, arguing that the respondent did not assert exceptional circumstances to justify sua sponte reopening (DHS Opposition to Motion at 4). The DHS further asserted that, to the extent that the respondent was asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent’s motion should be denied for failure to comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (DHS Opposition to Motion at 5-6).
 
On February 2, 2016, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion, finding that the respondent did not comply with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent appeals this determination.
 
In his motion to reopen and on appeal, the respondent claims that previous counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Along with his brief on appeal, the respondent has filed new evidence that he claims supports his assertion that his former attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel and that his actions prejudiced the respondent (see Respondent’s Brief at 7-9, see also attachments A-D). Among these documents is a letter written by the respondent’s prior counsel stating that although the respondent articulated a fear of return to El Salvador, no asylum application was pursued before the Immigration Court or the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) (see attachment D).
 
*2 The respondent has shown ineffective assistance of counsel, which justifies a remand. Based on the totality of the circumstances, we determine it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge to allow the respondent to pursue an application for asylum and related relief.1 The Immigration Judge should also consider whether, in accordance with section 235(d)(7)(B) of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), Pub. L. No. 110-457, 122 Stat. 5044  (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3)(C)), the USCIS has initial jurisdiction over any application for asylum and withholding of removal.
 
On remand, the parties should be given the opportunity to present additional evidence and arguments. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The removal proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raymond G. Lahoud, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kamephis Perez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 12, 2016. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and denied a requested continuance.1 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance. At the hearing, the respondent requested a continuance of proceedings to enable him to pursue post-conviction relief with regard to the convictions that serve as the basis for removal and render him ineligible for relief from removal. The respondent was granted a continuance from July 28, 2015, to September 1, 2015, to submit an application for relief. He submitted no application on that date (I.J. at 2-3). Another continuance was granted to enable the respondent to submit the plea minutes from the conviction (I.J. at 3; Exh. 4). The case was then continued to January 12, 2016, for a decision (I.J. at 3). The respondent requested another continuance because he was still pursuing the motions to vacate the convictions that render him removable (I.J. at 3). The Immigration Judge denied the request in part because the plea minutes relating to the latter conviction show that the state court judge asked the respondent whether he understood that a guilty plea may result in his deportation (I.J. at 3-6; Exh. 4).2
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §.§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009). We conclude that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors in determining that good cause was not shown for a continuance.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue the post-conviction motions, such motions do not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). Nor do they render the convictions non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra; Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992). We also note that the respondent’s motions were scheduled to be heard on April 27, 2016, but the respondent does not indicate that the convictions have been vacated.3
 
*2 Also on appeal, the respondent challenges his classification as an arriving alien. He asserts that his re-entry into the United States was not an admission. He asserts that his June 2015 trip to the Dominican Republic was brief, casual, and innocent, and therefore should not be considered an admission under the Fleuti doctrine that arose out of Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U.S. 449 (1963).
 
However, this Board has concluded that the amendment to section 101(a)(13) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13), by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (Sept. 30, 1996) (IIRIRA), eliminated the Fleuti doctrine. See Matter of Collado-Munoz, 21 I&N Dec. 1061 (BIA 1998). In Matter of Collado-Munoz, this Board held that, under the amended section 101(a)(13), a lawful permanent resident who was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, on return from travel abroad, would be seeking admission. The Supreme Court assumed this to be the case in Vartelas v. Holder, 132 S. Ct. 1479, 1484-85 & n.2 (2012). In that case, the Supreme Court held that the Fleuti doctrine still applies to lawful permanent residents with pre-IIRIRA convictions who travel abroad. See Vartelas v. Holder, supra, at 1489-92. However, in the present case, both of the respondent’s convictions are post-IIRIRA convictions, having occurred on January 27, 1999, and October 6, 2010. Consequently, the amended section 101(a)(13) applies to the respondent, and he was properly classified as a lawful permanent resident seeking admission.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Relief from removal is not an issue on appeal.

In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel. See also Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. ___, 133 S. Ct. 1103 (2013) (holding that Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, which requires defense counsel to advise a defendant about the risk of deportation arising from a guilty plea, does not apply retroactively).

If the respondent were to ultimately prevail in his post-conviction motions, he may file a motion to reopen with the Board asking it to consider such evidence.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rory H. Potter
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on July 9, 2015, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our April 28, 2015 affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s November 5, 2013 decision. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his 2004 removal order based on a change in the law. The respondent now filed a motion to reopen with the Board. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has opposed the respondent’s current motion. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
As the DHS correctly points out, the respondent’s motion, submitted on July 10, 2015, is both untimely and number-barred. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent acknowledges that his current motion is number-barred, but argues that sua sponte reopening is nonetheless warranted on the basis of the ineffective assistance of his attorney. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir. 2008) (“This court has held that a request for equitable tolling of a time- or number-barred motion to reopen on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is ‘in essence an argument that the BIA should have exercised its discretion to reopen the proceeding sua sponte based upon the doctrine of equitable tolling.”DD’ (internal citation omitted)).
 
The respondent’s attorney’s failure to meet the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit’s filing deadline for appealing the Board’s decision does not demonstrate a sufficient basis to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings. The respondent did not meet the procedural requirements to claim ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 496-98 (5th Cir. 2000) (upholding the Lozada requirements). In fact, the respondent has retained the same attorney for this motion to reopen. The respondent also does not demonstrate that he merits a favorable exercise of our discretion, after previously filing an untimely motion and failing to raise issues before the appropriate adjudicative body, and after we have twice previously declined to exercise our sua sponte authority. See generally Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “[t]he power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

April 27, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven R. Espinoza, Esquire
*1 A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was mailed on December 21, 2015. The appeal was accordingly due on or before January 20, 2016.1 The record reflects, however, that the Notice of Appeal was mailed after the due date and filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on March 16, 2016. We conclude that the appeal is untimely.
 
In conjunction with the appeal the respondent files a motion to accept late-filed appeal.2 Counsel states in his February 29, 2016, declaration that his staff did not calendar the deadline to file the Notice of Appeal with the Board and did not bring the Immigration Judge’s decision to his attention until on or about February 9, 2016 (Motion Exh. B). We conclude that the respondent does not show substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to properly allege ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent does not present his affidavit regarding the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. His February 16, 2016, statement that he wants counsel to file an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen leaves many questions unanswered (Motion Exh. C).3 The second requirement is excused because counsel obviously knows about the allegations of ineffective assistance.
 
The respondent did not file a complaint against counsel with California state bar authorities or explain why not. Counsel did not self-report his ineffective assistance to California state bar authorities. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 825-26 (9th Cir. 2003) (failure to file bar complaint not fatal where former counsel submitted letter of self-report to bar); section 6068(o) of the Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code (duties of attorney). When an alien retains prior counsel to pursue an argument of inadequacy of that same attorney, the reporting requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, remain meaningful. It is not for the attorney to decide issues regarding his or her prior conduct. The self-reporting requirement lets a state bar decide and puts the state bar on notice if there are further problems, particularly problems of a continuing nature.
 
*2 We conclude that the respondent does not show substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada and we thus do not consider this appeal by certification. The Immigration Judge’s decision is therefore now final, and the record will be returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.
 
Because we are dismissing the appeal as untimely, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See sections 240(c)(6)(A) & (B) and 240(c)(7)(A) & (C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6)(A) & (B) and (c)(7)(A) & (C); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); see Matter of J- J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
In light of the foregoing, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to accept late-filed appeal is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed as untimely.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vera Alicia Weisz, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on October 22, 2015. By a decision of that date, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the decision of the Immigration Judge of April 1, 2014. The Board noted that the respondent had not provided any evidence with his appeal to establish his contention that a conviction had been vacated and did not submit a brief as had been indicated on his Notice of Appeal. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and seeks the reopening of proceedings and relief from removal. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion.
 
In the proceedings before the Immigration Judge and in the respondent’s appeal to the Board, the respondent was represented by Myava R. Escamilla who was disbarred by the California State Bar on October 16, 2015. Given the facts presented by this case, we find that the respondent has properly asserted a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See generally Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-640 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be granted and the record will be remanded for further proceedings to allow the respondent the opportunity to apply for any relief for which he may be eligible.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Genesis A. Peduto, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 6, 2015, which ordered him removed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but we review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed upon noting that no application for relief was filed and that no relief was available. We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. Although the respondent indicated on the Notice of Appeal that he intended to file a separate written brief or statement, no such submission has been received, despite counsel being granted the requested extension. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E). In the Notice of Appeal, the respondent states only that there was ineffective assistance of counsel and that counsel failed to file for any relief on behalf of the respondent. However, the respondent does not in any way comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Moreover, he has not identified any relief for which he may be eligible. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on May 6, 2015, at which time the respondent’s appeal of the decision of the Immigration Judge of September 25, 2013, was summarily dismissed. On August 3, 2015, the respondent filed the timely motion to reopen now before the Board alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The respondent has substantially complied with the process requisite to asserting such a claim. See generally Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-640 (BIA 1988). The respondent has provided a detailed affidavit describing the claimed ineffective assistance of counsel who is now deceased. Given the affidavit and other evidence presented, we find that reopening should be granted.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen is granted and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision. On remand, the respondent will have the opportunity to apply for any relief from removal for which he may be eligible.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gerald Karikari, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Andrew Kowalczyk
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent filed a motion to reconsider, considered timely filed, on January 29, 2016, after we issued a final removal order on December 16, 2015. Section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The motion, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), will be denied.
 
The Board’s December 16, 2015, order affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision denying a further continuance of the proceedings. We also upheld the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent had abandoned any application for relief from removal, due to his failure to file the application by the filing deadline. We noted that an Immigration Judge has authority to set deadlines for the applications, and may deem an application abandoned if not filed by a deadline. We noted that the respondent had been in removal proceedings for three years, and was granted six continuances. We agreed with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s desire to further recover from his April 2014 knee surgery did not establish good cause for a continuance. Nevertheless, the respondent did not file any application for relief by the deadline.
 
The pending motion does not establish any error of fact or law in our December 16, 2015, decision, or show that an argument was overlooked. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). While the motion suggests that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel from his prior attorneys, the assertions meet none of the procedural requirements for making such a claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent claims that his hearing was not fair, in that he was not provided a Twi interpreter. This claim was not made on appeal to the Board. Matter of Cervantes, 22 I&N Dec. 560, 561 n.1 (BIA 1999)(declining to address an issue not raised by party on appeal).
 
In any event, despite the respondent’s belated suggestion that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, or should have been provided with an interpreter, he does not show prima facie eligibility for any form of relief from removal. Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247, 251 (BIA 2007). While the respondent says that he is pursuing a visa application as a widower, no evidence of any such application is presented. Additionally, the Board in visa petition proceedings affirmed the DHS’ decision that the respondent failed to establish that his marriage to his now-deceased wife was legally valid.
 
*2 The respondent’s case also does not represent an “exceptional situation”, warranting reopening under our sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
The pending motion will, therefore, be, denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marcela Gyires, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Richard Jamadar
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of December 4, 2014. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on January 18, 2007. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The record reflects that on April 24, 2006, an Immigration Judge terminated proceedings, finding that the respondent had shown prima facie evidence of U.S. citizenship. The DHS appealed, and on November 24, 2006, the Board sustained the DHS appeal, vacated the Immigration Judge’s decision, and remanded the case to the Immigration Court. As Mr. Pineda had entered his appearance before the Board by filing a Form EOIR-27, a copy of our decision was mailed to him.
 
The December 20, 2006, Notice of Hearing (NOH) for the January 18, 2007, hearing was properly mailed to the respondent’s counsel, Ralph Pineda, Esquire, who had previously entered his appearance in Immigration Court through the filing of a Form EOIR-28 (IJ. at 2, 4). The January 18, 2007, in absentia order was personally served on Mr. Pineda on the same date. In his September 18, 2014, motion to reopen in absentia proceedings, which was not accompanied by an affidavit from the respondent, the respondent alleges that he thought he need not appear because the Immigration Judge had previously terminated proceedings. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
On appeal, the respondent again alleges he should have been served with notice. However, the respondent has not established that notice to counsel was improper, and that it did not constitute notice to the respondent; nor has the respondent alleged or established ineffective assistance of counsel. To establish ineffective assistance of counsel as “exceptional circumstances” for an alien’s failure to appear, the alien must substantially comply with the procedural requirements set forth by the Board in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005). Lozada requires the alien to: (1) support the motion with an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel and what representations counsel did or did not make to the alien in this regard; (2) inform counsel of the allegations being leveled against him or her and give counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) state in the motion “““‘whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not.”DD’ Dakane, 399 F.3d at 1274 (quoting Lozada, supra, at 639). Here, the respondent has complied with none of the above-noted requirements, and consequently we find no basis to disturb the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carlos A. Piovanetti, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s November 17, 2015, order denying his October 19, 2015, motion to reopen. The respondent has also submitted evidence on appeal, which we construe as a motion to remand. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
A motion to reopen must generally be filed within 90 days of the date of a final order of removal. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent does not challenge the Immigration Judge’s determination that the motion to reopen was filed outside of this 90-day window (I.J. at 2). Instead, the respondent argues that the timeliness requirement should be equitably tolled in light of ineffective assistance of counsel he claims to have received during his removal proceedings (Form EOIR-26 at 2). See Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 713 F.3d 1357, 1362-65 (11th Cir. 2013) (en banc). Specifically, he claims that his prior attorney failed to fully consider his potential avenues for pursuing Special Immigration Juvenile (“SIJ”) status before advising the respondent to accept an order of removal.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not satisfied the procedural requirements for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 3). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); accord Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir. 2003). As the Immigration Judge properly noted, the respondent has not established that prior counsel has been informed of the present allegations or that a complaint has been filed with the relevant disciplinary authorities (Id.). See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. Thus, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not properly raised a claim for reopening on this basis, even under a lower “substantial compliance” standard. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 1222 (declining to decide whether substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements is sufficient); see also Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005) (assuming, without deciding, that substantial compliance is sufficient). The motion is therefore untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
*2 We also find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request for sua sponte reopening (I.J. at 3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). Absent evidence that the relevant state court order has been obtained, the respondent’s potential eligibility for a yet-to-be filed application for SIJ status is too speculative to warrant reopening at this point. See also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (explaining that sua sponte authority is reserved for truly exceptional situations).
 
Finally, we construe the additional evidence the respondent has submitted on appeal as a motion to remand. See Matter of L-A-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 516, 526 (BIA 2015). The evidence reflects the respondent’s ongoing efforts to obtain the relevant state court order needed to apply for SIJ status. For similar reasons discussed above, we are not persuaded that the respondent has met his heavy burden of establishing that the result in this case would be different if a remand were granted for consideration of this evidence. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carlos Piovanetti, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Denise C. Hochul
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of November 13, 2014. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on August 29, 2014. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal.1 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
The respondent moved to reopen proceedings, acknowledging that he had notice of his August 29, 2014, hearing, but alleging that a change of venue motion had been filed on August 22, 2014, and further asserting that due to the respondent’s limited economic resources and his misplaced belief his presence would be excused, he failed to appear at his hearing.
 
Contrary to the respondent’s assertion, the record does not reflect that the change of venue motion was filed prior to the August 29, 2014, hearing but instead it was only included in the motion to reopen filed on October 6, 2014 (I.J. at 3). Regardless, even had the change of venue motion been filed before his hearing, the “mere submission of a motion for change of venue does not excuse an alien’s failure to appear.” Romero-Morales v. INS, 25 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir. 1994). In addition, as noted by the Immigration Judge, although the motion included an affidavit from the respondent, it pertained to the enclosed motion to change venue, and does not address why he failed to appear at his hearing on August 29, 2014.
 
To the extent the respondent implied in his motion that he failed to appear because of ineffective assistance by counsel for failure to file the change of venue motion, he has not substantially complied with the procedural requirements for bringing an ineffective assistance claim. The requirements include submitting (1) an affidavit describing in detail the agreement with counsel, (2) proof that counsel was informed of the allegations and had an opportunity to respond, and (3) a statement regarding whether a complaint was filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and, if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988); Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that an “alien who has failed to comply substantially with the Lozada requirements ... forfeits her ineffective assistance of counsel claim.”).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent now alleges that he was unable to attend his hearing because he took his niece to a medical appointment on the date of his hearing, and he proffers a letter from a physician. We will construe the submission as a motion to remand and will deny the request. See Matter of L-A-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 516, 526 (BIA 2015) (“A motion to remand for the purpose of presenting additional evidence must conform to the same standards as a motion to reopen and will only be granted if the evidence was previously unavailable and would likely change the result in the case”).
 
We first note that the respondent has not adequately explained why this was not raised in the motion to reopen. The respondent’s counsel alleges that this evidence was not available because the respondent’s counsel “had not heard from respondent” when the motion was filed. However, the respondent’s failure to maintain contact with his counsel does not establish that the evidence was previously unavailable and could have been submitted or summarized with his original motion to reopen. See Li Yong Cao v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, All F.3d 149, 156 (2d Cir. 2005) (explaining that the BIA may decline to remand where the movant has failed to “comply with the requirement of 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(c)(1) [now found at § 1003.2(c)(1)] that his motion articulate material, previously unavailable evidence”).
 
Moreover, the respondent did not submit medical records or other corroboration to support his apparent claim that he was unable to attend his hearing because his niece suffered from a serious medical condition. See Alrefae v. Chertoff, 471 F.3d 353, 357-358 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting that “““[t]he BIA’s standard for exceptional circumstances appears fairly stringent, both in terms of the required severity of the circumstances and the proof required to establish a claim”); see also Matter of B-A-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 57, 58-59 (BIA 1998) (“Where an alien argues that his failure to appear resulted from a ‘serious illness,’ we normally would expect specific, detailed medical evidence to corroborate the alien’s claim.”). Because the doctor’s note did not clarify the severity of the respondent’s niece’s condition, the respondent has not established that his niece’s condition prevented the respondent from attending his hearing.
 
The Board has stated that “[n]otifying the Immigration Court of the respondent’s unavailability is a minimal and logical step that, if not taken, is a factor which tends to undermine a claim of exceptional circumstances.” Matter of B-A-S-, supra, at 57. Here, there is no indication that the respondent sent the doctor’s note to the Immigration Judge or notified the Immigration Court of his inability to be present prior to the hearing. Consequently, the respondent has not established that the proffered evidence would change the outcome of proceedings and remand is not warranted.
 
*3 The respondent has not established any exceptional circumstances to support sua sponte reopening. See generally Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (Board’s discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (Board and Immigration Judges retain authority to sua sponte reopen or reconsider proceedings in exceptional situations; sua sponte authority is not meant to cure filing defects or otherwise circumvent the regulations).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003. 1(e)(5).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In its opposition to the DHS motion for summary affirmance, the respondent’s counsel alleges that he has not received the briefing schedule, and he requests a new briefing schedule. The record reflects that two briefing schedules were mailed to the respondent’s counsel at the address he provided. One was issued on January 27, 2015, providing a due date of February 17, 2015, and then a second one was issued on January 28, 2015, providing a due date of February 18, 2015. There is no indication that either notice was returned by the postal service, and therefore no new briefing schedule will be issued.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul Saul Haar, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)] - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status (conceded)
 
Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - Nonimmigrant visa revoked under section 221(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1201(i)] - revocation of visas or documents (conceded)
 
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia and a citizen of Venezuela,1 appeals from the Immigration Judge’s January 13, 2015, decision pretermitting the respondent’s application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(a), based on an approved Alien Relative Petition (Form I-130) filed by the respondent’s United States citizen wife. A motion to reopen filed with the Immigration Judge prior to the respondent’s filing of his appeal has been forwarded with the record for our consideration. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).2 The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a response to the appeal or the motion. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). The appeal will be dismissed; and the motion, denied.
 
We review findings of fact for clear error, including credibility findings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The following relevant facts are not in dispute. On or about March 21, 2001, the respondent entered the United States and remained until he departed in March 2006 (Respondent’s Brief at 1; I.J. at 3-4; Exh. 3 at 12; DHS Motion to Pretermit at 4). From 2001 to 2006, the respondent had no legal status in the United States (Respondent’s Brief at 1; I.J. at 3-4; DHS Motion to Pretermit at 4). The respondent re-entered the United States on May 11, 2007, and remained until his departure in June 2011 (Respondent’s Brief at 1-2; I.J. at 3-4; Exh. 3 at 12; DHS Motion to Pretermit at 4). On July 12, 2011, the respondent re-entered the United States as a nonimmigrant employee of an international organization (Respondent’s Brief at 2; I.J. at 4; Exh. 3 at 13).
 
*2 On May 13, 2013, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status because, among other things, USCIS determined that the respondent’s entries and departures render him inadmissible pursuant to section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I), for being an alien unlawfully present after previous immigration violations (I.J. at 2; Exh. 3 at 1-10).
 
The respondent’s nonimmigrant status as the employee of an international organization was revoked on December 4, 2013, pursuant to section 221(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1201(i) (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 4; Exh. 1). On December 5, 2013, the DHS initiated removal proceedings against the respondent, charging him as being subject to removal pursuant to sections 237(a)(1)(B) and (C)(i)(I) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(1)(B) and (C)(i)(I), because his nonimmigrant visa was revoked and because he failed to maintain or comply with the conditions of his nonimmigrant status (I.J. at 2, Tr. at 4; Exh. 1). On June 17, 2014, the respondent conceded removability and renewed his application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act before the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 4-5).
 
On January 3, 2015, the Immigration Judge found the respondent statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under 245(a) of the Act because he is not admissible (I.J. at 5). The Immigration Judge determined, inter alia, that the respondent was inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act because he had been unlawfully present in the United States for an aggregate period of more than 1 year between 2001 and 2006, departed, and then subsequently entered the United States without being admitted or paroled in 2007 (I.J. at 2-3, 5-6). The Immigration Judge further noted that no waiver is available to address the respondent’s inadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i) of the Act (I.J. at 5).
 
The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court on January 30, 2015 (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen). The respondent attached to his motion (1) his affidavit regarding his May 11, 2007, entry to the United States; (2) the results of a polygraph test; (3) a series of photographs which the respondent indicates were taken in Spring 2007; (4) a January 3, 2008, report regarding traveler inspections at United States ports of entry; and (5) a draft application for a waiver of grounds of inadmissibility (Form I-601) (Attachments to Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 1-70). However, the respondent perfected a timely appeal by filing a Notice of Appeal with this Board on February 12, 2015, prior to the Immigration Judge issuing a decision on the pending motion (Respondent’s Notice of Appeal). Accordingly, jurisdiction vested with the Board and the Immigration Judge was divested of jurisdiction over the motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of H-, 20 I&N Dec. 611, 612 n.1 (BIA 1992). That motion is now before us as a motion to remand, and the arguments are incorporated into the appeal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4); BIA Practice Manual Rule 4.2(a)(ii).
 
*3 The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in concluding that he is statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(a) of the Act (Respondent’s Brief at 3-11; I.J. at 2-5). Specifically, he maintains that he is not inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act because his application for adjustment of status is not an application for admission (Notice of Appeal). The respondent also argues that new evidence, submitted with his motion to reopen, establishes that he is not otherwise inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act because he was inspected and admitted when he entered the United States on May 11, 2007 (Respondent’s Brief at 8-11).
 
We will deny the respondent’s motion to remand. A motion to remand for the purpose of presenting additional evidence must conform to the same standards as a motion to reopen. Matter of L-A-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 516, 526 (BIA 2015). A motion to reopen will not be granted unless it appears to the Board that the evidence offered in support of the motion is material and was not available or could not have been discovered or presented previously. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988).
 
The respondent has not established that the evidence submitted with his motion is new or previously unavailable evidence that could not have been discovered or presented at the hearing before the Immigration Judge. The respondent’s counsel claims that he was unable to submit the evidence previously because he learned of the circumstances surrounding the respondent’s May 11, 2007, entry into the United States after the Immigration Judge issued his January 13, 2015, decision (Respondent’s Brief at 3; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 1, 3). However, the statements of counsel, which are not evidence, do not explain why the information was not previously discovered (Respondent’s Brief; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen). See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980) (uncorroborated declarations of counsel are not evidence).
 
As a result, the respondent’s motion is unsupported by new, previously unavailable evidence material to his claim. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent has made no allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel and he has not presented evidence to meet the procedural requirements for such a claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Therefore, we conclude that the respondent has not established an adequate basis for remanding the record with respect to the facts and circumstances surrounding the respondent’s May 11, 2007, entry into the United States.
 
*4 The respondent’s argument that his application for adjustment of status is not an application for “admission” as defined by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is inapposite because the ground of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act does not refer to an alien who seeks “admission,” but instead applies when any alien “enters or attempts to enter” the United States (Respondent’s Brief at 4-6, 8). Moreover, to be eligible for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, an alien must be “admissible” without regard to whether the alien is an applicant for “admission” as the term is used in the cases cited by the respondent (Respondent’s Brief at 5-6). See Leiba v. Holder, 699 F.3d 346, 352-56 (4th Cir. 2012) (construing the phrase “lawfully admitted for permanent residence” in section 212(h) of the Act); Bracamontes v. Holder, 675 F.3d 380, 385-87 (4th Cir. 2012) (same); Aremeu v. Department of Homeland Security, 450 F.3d 578, 581-83 (4th Cir. 2006) (construing the phrase “the date of admission” in section 237(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act).
 
As the respondent does not otherwise contest the Immigration Judge’s finding of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act nor does he claim eligibility for a waiver of this ground of inadmissibility, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) of the Act and, consequently, statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act (Respondent’s Brief; I.J. at 4-5).
 
We therefore decline to address the Immigration Judge’s alternative finding that the respondent is inadmissible under section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the Act. See Matter of L-A-C-, supra, at 526 n.7 (declining to reach alternative issues on appeal regarding ineligibility for relief where the applicant is statutorily ineligible for relief on other grounds). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The Notice to Appear (NTA) alleges the respondent is a citizen and national of Venezuela (Exh. 1). At a master calendar hearing held on June 17, 2014, the respondent claimed to be a citizen and national of both Colombia and Venezuela (Tr. at 4). As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent’s May 22, 2013, sworn statement indicates that he renounced his Venezuelan citizenship (I.J. at 1, n.2; Exh. 3 at 11).

On March 25, 2015, the Immigration Judge issued a decision on the respondent’s January 30, 2015, motion to reopen finding that he had no jurisdiction over the motion because the respondent had filed a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s January 13, 2015, decision with the Board. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). For purposes of this decision, we will refer to portions of the Immigration Judge’s January 13, 2015, decision as “I.J. at...”.

APPLICATION: Suppression; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 1, 2014. In her decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to terminate removal proceedings, sustained the charge of removability, and ordered the respondent removed from the United States to Mexico. During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a brief that is styled as an appeal brief, but, substantively, it is a motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) filed a motion for summary affirmance. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed, and her request to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel will be denied.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). Since the respondent’s case arises subsequent to May 11, 2005, it is governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act. See Matter of S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 42 (BIA 2006).
 
This matter arises from a November 3, 2012, border stop at the Otay Mesa, California, port of entry (Exhs. 1, 3). As a result of events that occurred at the border station while the respondent was attempting to gain admission to the United States, the respondent was detained, and, based upon answers elicited by United State Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers, served with a Notice to Appear (Form I-862) and placed in removal proceedings (Exhs. 1, 3). On November 18, 2013, the respondent filed a motion to terminate the removal proceedings asserting that her acquiescence to smuggling her relatives into the United States was not an affirmative act; thus, she was not removable under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act for knowingly encouraging, inducing, assisting, abetting, or aiding any other alien to enter or try to enter the United States (Exh. 4). The DHS opposed the motion (Exh. 5). On January 7, 2014, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to terminate (Exh. 6). On April 29, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to subpoena the four CBP officers who encountered and interviewed her on or about November 3, 2012, when she applied for admission at the Otay Mesa, California, port of entry; the DHS opposed the respondent’s motion (Exhs. 11, 12). The Immigration Judge issued an interim decision in which she denied the respondent’s motion on May 28, 2014 (Exh. 14).
 
*2 On October 1, 2014, the Immigration Judge issued an oral decision that sustained the charge of removability under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act and ordered the respondent removed from the United States to Mexico (Exh. 1). The respondent timely appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent’s brief is styled as an appeal brief, but, substantively, it is a motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel and a request to suppress the testimony she gave on October 1, 2014. Specifically, the respondent asserts her former counsel’s performance was so deficient that the respondent’s due process rights were violated when her former counsel failed to present objections to the DHS’s evidence in support of the Notice to Appear, failed to submit a motion to suppress said evidence, filed defective motions to terminate and for subpoena, and failed to advise the respondent of her right to remain silent and, instead, encouraged her to testify (Resp.’s br. at 7-17; Exhs. 1, 3, 4, 11). She further requests her October 1, 2014, testimony be stricken from the record. It is these arguments we now address.
 
The respondent did not comply with any of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (Resp.’s br. at 9). See Al Ramahi v. Holder, 725 F.3d 1133, 1138-39 (9th Cir. 2013) (compliance with Lozada ensures that the Board has an objective basis for assessing the substantial number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that come before it); see also Tamang v. Holder, 598 F.3d 1083, 1090-91 (9th Cir. 2010) (failure to satisfy Lozada was fatal to ineffective assistance of counsel claim where ineffectiveness was not plain on face of record and petitioner failed to provide any information regarding his purported former counsel). Although compliance with Lozada is not required when the error is plain on the face of the record, there is no plain error in the present case. Tamang v. Holder, supra.
 
Moreover, we disagree with the respondent’s assertion that former counsel violated her due process rights by not objecting to the DHS’s evidence (two Records of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien, Form I-213s) for the respondent and the smuggled alien, a report from the CBP officer at primary inspection, and the Record of Sworn Statement in Proceedings of the smuggled alien (Form I-867A)) and by not filing a motion to suppress such evidence (Exh. 3 at Tabs A-D; Resp.’s br. at 9-11).1 As to the aforementioned evidence, the respondent has not presented a sufficient argument to support the conclusion that, had prior counsel objected to DHS’s evidence, such an objection would have been sustained or the outcome of the proceedings may have been affected (Resp.’s br. at 9-10). See Martinez-Hernandez v. Holder, 778 F.3d 1086, 1088 (9th Cir. 2015) (in an immigration proceeding, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires a showing of inadequate performance and prejudice); see also Torres-Chavez v. Holder, 567 F.3d 1096, 1100 (9th Cir. 2009).
 
*3 The Ninth Circuit has repeatedly held that, in immigration hearings, the sole test for admission of evidence is whether the evidence is probative and its admission is fundamentally fair; it has further held the admission of government documents like the Form I-213 is fair absent evidence of coercion or that the statements are not those of the alien. See Sanchez v. Holder, 704 F.3d 1107, 1109 (9th Cir. 2012); see also Espinoza v. INS, 45 F.3d 308, 310-11 (9th Cir. 1995) (rejecting argument that a Form I-213 is inadmissible as hearsay because “[t]he sole test for admission of evidence [in a deportation proceeding] is whether the evidence is probative and its admission is fundamentally fair”). The respondent presents insufficient argument on appeal that the DHS improperly coerced her or that she or the relative she smuggled did not make the statements contained in the evidence; thus, we conclude the DHS’s evidence was properly admitted (Resp.’s br. at 9-11; Exh. 3 at Tabs A, C, D). Based on the foregoing, we cannot conclude the respondent’s prior counsel prejudiced the respondent’s case when she did not object to the government’s evidence or move to suppress it. See Martinez-Hernandez v. Holder, supra; see also U.S. v. Lopez-Chavez, 757 F.3d 1033, 1041, 1043 (9th Cir. 2014) (to establish ineffective assistance of counsel in immigration proceedings in violation of the right to due process, a petitioner must show: (1)that the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case, and (2) prejudice).
 
Likewise, we disagree with the respondent’s additional assertion that former counsel erred by filing a defective motion to terminate that did not contain a declaration regarding her detention and an accompanying motion to suppress evidence (Resp.’s br. at 11-13). Contrary to the respondent’s argument on appeal, we do not consider the evidence obtained during her detention to be in violation of 8 C.F.R. § 287.8(c)(2)(vii) (Resp.’s br. at 12; Tr. at 37). Id. (prohibiting immigration officers from using threats, coercion, or physical abuse to induce a suspect to waive his or her rights to make a statement). The respondent cites no case law or other legal precedence to support the conclusion that, given the exigent circumstances of suspected alien smuggling, her length of detention, brief interrogations, and the CBP officers’ conduct was anything more than standard operating procedure (Resp.’s br. at 12, 15). We also note the presumption of regularity which presumes that public officers, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, have properly discharged their duties, including placing information on forms; no such “clear evidence to the contrary” exists here. U.S. v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996); see also Matter of Rodriguez, 13 I&N Dec. 746, 748 (BIA 1971) (discussing presumption of official regularity which attaches to the consular officer’s issuance of the visa in question). Based on the foregoing, we cannot conclude the respondent’s prior counsel prejudiced the respondent’s case by not including the respondent’s declaration with the motion to terminate and an accompanying motion to suppress. See Martinez-Hernandez v. Holder, supra; see also U.S. v. Lopez-Chavez, supra.
 
*4 We recognize the respondent’s prior counsel’s motion to subpoena the four CBP officers who encountered and interviewed the respondent on or about November 3, 2012, may not have fully comported with the requirements set forth in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.35(b)(2) (Resp.’s br. at 13-14; Exhs. 11, 14 at 3-4). However, the respondent’s case was not prejudiced because she did not cross-examine the CBP officers who prepared her Form I-213 and other relevant immigration documentation (Resp.’s br. at 14-15; Exh. 3 at Tab A). As previously noted, the test for admission of evidence is whether the evidence is probative and its admission is fundamentally fair and that the admission of government documents is fair absent evidence of coercion or that the statements are not those of the alien. Sanchez v. Holder, supra (determining that the Immigration Judge did not abuse his discretion by admitting Form I-213, even though the petitioner was not given an opportunity to cross-examine the preparer); see also Haile v. Holder, 658 F.3d 1122, 1128 (9th Cir. 2011) (“The sole test for admission of evidence is whether the evidence is probative and its admission is fundamentally fair.”); Espinoza v. INS, supra, at 309-10; see also Matter of Barcenas, 19 I&N Dec. 609, 611 (BIA 1988) (documentary evidence is admissible if it is probative and its use is fundamentally fair; absent evidence that a Form I-213 contains information that is incorrect or that was obtained by coercion or duress, the document is inherently trustworthy and admissible to prove removability). As previously noted, the respondent has not cited any case law or other legal precedence to support the conclusion that, given the exigent circumstances of suspected alien smuggling, the CBP officers’ conduct was anything more than standard operating procedure (Resp.’s br. at 14-15).2 Since we cannot conclude the respondent’s admissions of alien smuggling were made under coercion, and we see no other objection, the Immigration Judge’s admission of the Form I-213 was fundamentally fair and, thus, proper (Exhs. 3, 7). See Sanchez v. Holder, supra; see also Haile v. Holder, supra, see also Espinoza v. INS, supra. As such, even if we accepted the respondent’s allegation that her prior counsel filed a defective motion to subpoena the CBP officers who prepared the Form I-213, we cannot conclude it prejudiced her case. See Martinez-Hernandez v. Holder, supra; see also U.S. v. Lopez-Chavez, supra.
 
*5 Turning to the respondent’s argument that former counsel failed to advise her of her right to remain silent, the respondent’s brief does not contain a statement or affidavit to support this assertion, and the respondent’s counsel’s statements in the brief, without more, are not evidence (Resp.’s br. at 16). See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); see also Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980). Hence, we deny the respondent’s request to strike her testimony from the record, and decline to address this issue further.
 
In sum, we conclude the respondent’s numerous due process claims related to her former counsel’s performance are without merit. They collectively fail because the respondent has not shown her former counsel’s performance prejudiced the outcome of her proceedings. See Martinez-Hernandez v. Holder, supra; see also U.S. v. Lopez-Chavez, supra.
 
Finally, we conclude the Immigration Judge properly evaluated the issue of removability and found the respondent removable. The respondent does not seek any relief from removal either before the Immigration Judge or on appeal. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request to strike testimony from the record is denied.

We note the DVD of the respondent’s video recorded sworn statement was withdrawn by the DHS and will, therefore, not be addressed (Exhs. 3 at Tab E, 14 at 3-4).

2

As an aside, we further disagree with the respondent’s unsupported assertion that the Form I-213s were not properly authenticated after the DHS withdrew the DVD from the record; each one is signed by an authorized designee (Resp.’s br. at 15; Exh. 3 at Tabs A, C). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 287.6(a) and 1287.6(a) (an official record may be evidenced “by a copy attested by the official having legal custody of the record or by an authorized deputy”).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alary E. Piibe, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Caroline Clark
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s April 9, 2015, decision denying her motion to reopen. The respondent was previously ordered removed in absentia on July 19, 1999. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded only if the alien files a motion to reopen: (1) within 180 days after the date of the removal order in which she establishes that her failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances; or (2) at any time in which she establishes that she did not have proper notice of the hearing in which the removal order was entered. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); see also section 240(e)(1) of the Act (defining the term “““exceptional circumstances”).
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s March 13, 2015, motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances, finding the motion was untimely, and the respondent had not demonstrated due diligence in pursuing her claim. We agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
On appeal and in her motion to reopen, the respondent asserts that (1) she hired a person whom she believed to be an attorney and legal specialist to help with her immigration case, (2) this person advised her not to appear for her scheduled hearing, and (3) this ineffective assistance prejudiced her case. To the extent the respondent argues that she established exceptional circumstances based on ineffective assistance, such a claim is precluded as untimely, as the in absentia order was entered in July 1999, nearly 16 years prior to the filing of the motion to reopen. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
We note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this cases arises, has not yet determined if equitable tolling of statutory deadlines for ineffective assistance of counsel applies in immigration cases. The Fifth Circuit has previously stated that an alien’s request for equitable tolling on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is construed as an invitation for the Board to exercise its discretion to reopen proceedings sua sponte. See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir. 2008), abrogated by Mata v. Lynch, 135 S. Ct. 2150, 2155-56 (2015). In this case, the Immigration Judge made direct findings on the factors that would or would not permit equitable tolling in this case, separate from the sua sponte question. Specifically, he found that the respondent did not support her claim of ineffective assistance with sufficient evidence of compliance with the factors listed in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), as she did not provide details regarding the name of her purported representative, the name of his firm or office, or the location of their meeting (I.J. at 2). We therefore agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established that reopening is warranted under section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
*2 In addition, we find no basis for exercising our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings, in light of the respondent’s nearly 16-year delay in filing the instant motion (see also I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations). The respondent contends on appeal that a late filing, even one delayed by several years, does not necessarily demonstrate a lack of due diligence (Resp.’s Brief at 10). However, the respondent also acknowledges that she was represented in immigration proceedings in pursuit of adjustment of status as early as 2013, and her attorney learned of the 1999 in absentia order of removal in July 2013 (Resp.’s Brief at 4-5). As such, we find unavailing her argument that she could not have investigated her removal order and pursued reopening prior to the filing of the instant motion in March 2015.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Denise C. Hochul
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native of Niger and a citizen of Mali, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on June 1, 2007, after not appearing at a hearing. He appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 10, 2015, denying his June 9, 2015, motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that his non-appearance at the hearing was caused by “exceptional circumstances.” See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) (providing that a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal). The respondent’s motion was filed more than 8 years after the hearing, and it is untimely.
 
In addition, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny equitable tolling of the 180-day period to file a motion to reopen. The respondent has not complied with any of the procedural requirements for establishing that ineffective assistance of counsel caused his failure to appear, and he did not file his motion with due diligence. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We also do not consider evidence first provided on appeal. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984) (holding that the Board does not consider evidence first provided on appeal). Moreover, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny sua sponte reopening of these proceedings, inasmuch as an exceptional situation was not established. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s and the Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). In light of the foregoing, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William Baker, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on October 2, 2014, when we denied the respondent’s timely motion to reopen proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel. It is presently before us pursuant to the November 18, 2015, order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granting the government’s motion to remand. The government sought a remand for further consideration of the respondent’s requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.
 
In view of the court’s order granting the government’s motion to remand, and upon further consideration of the overall facts and circumstances presented here, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen and will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. Upon remand, the respondent may apply for any relief from removal for which she may be eligible. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The decision of the Board dated October 2, 2014, is vacated and the motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Valmiki Reyes, Esquire
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has filed a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 17, 2014, which deemed his applications to have been abandoned and ordered the respondent removed from the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a brief or other response. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
An Immigration Judge may deny applications for withholding of removal, protection under the Convention Against Torture, cancellation of removal, and other applications, as abandoned for failure to have fingerprints taken and otherwise complete the biometrics requirement. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.47(a)-(d). Here, the Immigration Judge correctly set forth the procedural history of the case, in which all of the procedural requirements for making such a finding were met, including DHS providing the respondent with biometrics instructions forms, the Immigration Judge informing the respondent of the deadline for completion of biometrics, and informing him of the consequences of noncompliance (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 23-24, 28). See Matter of D-M-C-P-, 26 I&N Dec. 644, 649 (BIA 2015).
 
The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent failed to show good cause for failing to timely comply with the biometrics requirements, where he appeared at his final hearing without his biometrics completed and counsel informed the court that the respondent had failed to cooperate in preparing his case (I.J. at 1-2; Respondent’s Notice of Appeal). See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). On appeal, the respondent argues that the reason the biometrics were not submitted was because he had not paid his attorney the full amount for preparation of his case, even though he had paid her $500 to begin work on the case and had told her that he was having difficulty paying on time (Resp. Notice of Appeal). This does not constitute good cause. Id. As noted in the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent himself failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing his claims to relief and seeking the completion of his biometrics in a timely manner over a 6 month period (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 14-33). The biometrics forms, deadline date, and warnings were given directly to the respondent at an earlier hearing; he appeared at the following hearing without completed biometrics and having hired a lawyer just 1 day prior to the filing deadline; and following a further continuance still failed to comply with biometrics or file any applications, either with the assistance of counsel or on his own (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 23-24, 27-29, 31).1 The respondent has also not established “good cause” on appeal to the Board, for example by demonstrating that he immediately took action to comply with the biometrics requirement following the Immigration Judge’s entry of a decision in this matter. Id. We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not show good cause for his failure to timely comply with the biometrics requirements, and properly deemed any applications to be abandoned.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: JUAN BELTRAN ORTIZ
File: AXXX XX1 425 - Houston, TX
March 8, 2016
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Olivieri Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s November 16, 2015, decision denying his motion to reopen the removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is the subject of an administratively final order of removal issued by an Immigration Judge on September 25, 2000. The respondent was physically removed to Mexico pursuant to that order on November 15, 2000.
 
On October 21, 2015, the respondent filed a “motion to reopen sua sponte” with the Immigration Court in which he requested that his removal proceedings be reopened. The Immigration Judge denied the motion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), which provides in relevant part that “[a] motion to reopen . . . shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States.” We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, which is in accordance with controlling precedent in this jurisdiction. See Ovalles v. Holder, 577 F.3d 288, 292-93 (5th Cir. 2009) (recognizing that the departure bar precludes sua sponte reopening of removal proceedings); Salgado v. Lynch, 609 F. App’x 233, 234 (5th Cir. 2015); cf. Garcia-Carias v. Holder, 697 F.3d 257, 265 (5th Cir. 2012) (noting that “Ovalles resolved the issue of the applicability of the departure regulation to the Board’s regulatory power to reopen or reconsider sua sponte.”)
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the record should be remanded because the attorney who filed his motion to reopen provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to request equitable tolling of the 90-day statutory deadline for such motions. The respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is deficient on its face, however, because the respondent has neither filed a bar disciplinary complaint against former counsel nor adequately explained why not, as required by Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). We deem compliance with the bar complaint requirement to be essential, for several reasons: it serves the long-term interest of policing the immigration bar; it deters meritless claims and increases our confidence in the particular claim’s validity; and it “serves to protect against collusion between alien and counsel in which ‘ineffective’ assistance is tolerated, and goes unchallenged by an alien before disciplinary authorities, because it results in a benefit to the alien in that delay can be a desired end, in itself, in immigration proceedings.” Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 604 (BIA 1996); see also Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-98 (5th Cir. 2000). “We consider the filing of such a complaint, or reasonably explaining why such was not done, to be a relatively small inconvenience for an alien who asks that he or she be given a new hearing in a system that is already stretched in terms of its adjudicatory resources.” Id. at 605. This last consideration is particularly weighty here, given that the respondent is seeking the reopening of removal proceedings that became final more than 15 years ago.
 
*2 In his appeal brief, the respondent claims that he did not file a bar complaint because former counsel “has acknowledged his ineffectiveness and immediately took steps to remedy the situation by referring Respondent to his present Counsel. . . .” (Resp. Brief at 15). This explanation is wholly unsubstantiated, however; a mere statement in the brief is not evidence. INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188 n.6 (1984).
 
Finally, the respondent has made no offer of proof on appeal regarding the evidence he believes former counsel should have presented in support of his equitable tolling claim. As a rule, an equitable tolling claim requires proof that the moving party “has been pursuing his rights diligently” and “that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.” See Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 750, 755 (2016) (quoting Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 649 (2010)). The respondent’s brief and supporting affidavit contain no indication of his diligence or of any extraordinary impediment to his filing of a timely motion to reopen.
 
In conclusion, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the removal proceedings. The following order will be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nina Bonyak, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Barbara Cigarroa
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative decision on November 24, 2015, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
Applicable regulations provide that a motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, a movant must satisfy the “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must show that competent counsel would have acted otherwise and that the alien was prejudiced. See Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5 Cir. 1994); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent has not established prejudice such that reopening is warranted. First, the respondent has not submitted any evidence along with his motion, including any applications for relief. More importantly, the respondent still has not established statutory eligibility for the relief. He was previously precluded from eligibility for adjustment of status based on his 1998 controlled substance conviction. He subsequently filed a motion for post-conviction relief which was denied. The respondent has not submitted any evidence with this motion to establish, nor does he argue, that his controlled substance conviction has since been overturned or is no longer valid for immigration purposes. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice from counsel’s actions or omissions such that he has established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. As such, the respondent’s motion is insufficient to meet his “heavy burden” of showing that it is likely that the result would change if the proceedings were reopened. See generally Matter of Coelho, supra. Therefore, we do not find that he has met his burden of showing that reopening of these proceedings is warranted. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mun Su Park, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; stay of removal
 
*1 On May 14, 2015, the Board upheld an Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable to the Phillippines, and denied a motion to remand. According to our records, the respondent attempted to file her first motion to reopen this matter for further proceedings on June 11, 2015. However, that filing was rejected for procedural defects because it was erroneously filed on a Notice of Appeal from a Decision of an Immigration Judge (Form EOIR-26). The respondent filed the instant pending motion to reopen on November 23, 2015, with an accompanying request for a stay of removal. The motion, to which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded, will be denied.
 
The respondent alleges that reopening is warranted due to the ineffective assistance of former counsel, Pamela Brown Blackburn, Esquire, who represented her on appeal before the Board and who attempted, unsuccessfully, to file her first motion to reopen before the Board. The respondent faults Blackburn for failing to submit an appeal brief challenging the Immigration Judge’s decision before we issued our May 14, 2015, decision, and also for not complying with Board procedures in filing the first motion to reopen. The respondent vaguely avers that “without the ineffective assistance of counsel, she could have subsequently been granted for a relief from removal.” (Respondent’s Combined Motion to Reopen and Motion for Stay at 5).
 
The respondent further argues that we should reopen and administratively close these proceedings based on her potential eligibility for a U-nonimmigrant visa before United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). (Respondent’s Combined Motion to Reopen and Motion for Stay at 6). Finally, she appears to argue that reopening and administrative closure is warranted based on general humanitarian concerns. (Id.).
 
The instant motion is untimely because it was filed more 90 days after the entry of our May 14, 2015, decision. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent has failed to demonstrate that any of the statutory or regulatory exceptions to the general 90-day time limitation on motions to reopen apply to her case.
 
Moreover, even if we were to deem the instant motion timely under the doctrine of equitable tolling, we still would find no basis to reopen these proceedings. See generally Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error).
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent seeks reopening based on Blackburn’s former actions or inactions, we discern no prejudice, such that reopening of these proceedings would be warranted. See, e.g., Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 153 (9th Cir. 1999) (finding that prejudice must be shown for a due process challenge and that prejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected outcome); see also Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004) (an alien can show prejudice where counsel’s performance “may have affected the outcome of the proceedings”).
 
In Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003), the Ninth Circuit held that an alien failed to show prejudice when he could not “show that his admissibility arguments might have been successful on appeal to the BIA.” Since prejudice had not been shown, the court rejected an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in that case and upheld the Board’s summary dismissal of the appeal even though counsel failed to file a brief or statement of reasons for the appeal.1
 
Here, like the alien in Rojas-Garcia, the respondent has not meaningfully shown that, had Blackburn filed an appeal brief from the Immigration Judge’s decision, the outcome of the proceedings may have been different. The respondent’s motion, which does not include a proposed appellate brief or offer the arguments that would be contained in a brief, does not persuade the Board that the Immigration Judge’s decision was incorrect or could have been overturned on appeal if Blackburn had filed a brief. It also fails to show that the respondent could establish that she is not removable, or that she is eligible for any relief from removal, in a reopened hearing.
 
Moreover, the respondent has not shown that she sustained prejudice from Blackburn’s misfiling of her first motion to reopen. While Blackburn erroneously submitted that filing, the respondent has not shown that any proper filing of that motion may have resulted in the reopening of these proceedings.
 
In view of the foregoing, we find no basis to reopen these proceedings based on an any alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel. We also decline to reopen and administratively close these proceedings. Administrative closure is an administrative convenience that removes cases from the calendar and does not result in a final order. See Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012); Matter of Lopez-Barrios, 20 I&N Dec. 203 (BIA 1990). Because a final removal order has already been entered in this case, administrative closure is not appropriate.2
 
Finally, we do not find exceptional circumstances that would warrant reopening pursuant to our discretionary sua sponte authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

The Rojas-Garcia decision distinguished Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir. 2000), in which the court recognized an ineffective assistance of counsel claim where the alien’s attorney failed to file a timely notice of appeal, resulting in summary dismissal of the appeal. Dearinger found a rebuttable presumption of prejudice, acknowledging that the alien was required to demonstrate a “plausible ground for relief to justify reopening for ineffective assistance of counsel. Id. at 1046. The alien met that standard.

2

We further note that if the respondent receives an approved U visa petition from USCIS, she may file a motion to reopen seeking to terminate removal proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(5)(i). Moreover, any request for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion or for general humanitarian relief from removal should be raised directly with the DHS.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Luiza A. Miller, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Romania, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s March 4, 2015, decision denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings after the issuance of an in absentia order of removal. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the respondent’s appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, under the “““clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On November 14, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to rescind the in absentia removal order issued on May 29, 2014, and reopen his removal proceedings. Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded upon (1) a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances; or (2) a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive notice of the hearing, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of his own. See also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999).
 
The respondent does not claim that he did not receive notice of his final hearing. Rather, he argues that he did not appear at his May 29, 2014, hearing because of exceptional circumstances. Namely, the respondent left the United States to attend to his minor son following the death of the respondent’s cousin, who was the respondent’s minor son’s caretaker (Respondent’s Motion to Rescind In Absentia Removal Order at 2, 5-6; Respondent’s Brief at 2-3).
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen because she determined that the Immigration Court did not have jurisdiction to consider a motion to reopen made by a person who is subject to removal proceedings subsequent to his departure from the United States (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Alternatively, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not establish that his failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances pursuant to section 240(e)(1) of the Act (I.J. at 2-3).
 
Subsequent to the issuance of the Immigration Judge’s March 4, 2015, decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this case arises, issued Toor v. Lynch, 789 F.3d 1055, 1064 (9th Cir. 2015), wherein it held that the regulatory departure bar, referenced by the Immigration Judge, “is invalid irrespective of the manner in which the [alien] departed the United States.” The petitioner in Toor v. Lynch, supra, like the respondent, voluntarily departed the United States during the pendency of his removal proceedings. Therefore, the departure bar may not be applied to dismiss the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
*2 However, upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established that he did not appear at his May 29, 2014, removal hearing because of exceptional circumstances (I.J. at 2-3). Section 240(e)(1) of the Act provides that the term “exceptional circumstances” refers to circumstances beyond the control of the alien.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent explained that he learned of his cousin’s death on May 20, 2014, and that he left the United States on May 23, 2014 (I.J. at 3; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 5-6). The respondent was represented by counsel at the time he learned of his cousin’s death (I.J. at 3; see Respondent’s Motion to Consolidate Cases, Apr. 2, 2014; Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings, Apr. 28, 2014). Although the respondent was represented by counsel and in the United States until May 23, 2014, he did not inform the Immigration Court of the circumstances regarding his son prior to his May 29, 2014, hearing (I.J. at 3). See generally Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, 298 F.3d 888, 892 (9th Cir. 2002) (explaining that it was not improper for the Board to consider the fact that the alien did not notify the immigration court of his inability to attend an upcoming hearing); Matter of B-A-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 57, 59 (BIA 1998) (“Notifying the Immigration Court of the respondent’s unavailability is a minimal and logical step that, if not taken, is a factor which tends to undermine a claim of exceptional circumstances.”). The respondent has not shown that he was unable to provide the Immigration Judge with prior notice of his inability to attend the hearing. Further, he has not claimed that he suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, the respondent has not satisfied the statutory ground for rescission of his order of removal pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Peter E. Torres, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider our December 23, 2015, decision denying his previous motion to reopen as untimely and number-barred. See Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) and (c)(7)(C). Because the respondent has submitted additional evidence, we will also treat the motion as seeking reopening. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
The respondent’s request for reconsideration will be denied, as we are not persuaded of any errors in our decision or an argument that we overlooked. See Matter of 0-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The respondent largely reiterates previously-considered arguments. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 58 (stating that “a motion to reconsider is not a process by which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief ....”). As we explained, the respondent did not meet his burden of demonstrating prejudicial error or due diligence concerning his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir. 2008) (in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is construed as a challenge to the Board’s discretionary sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings); United States v. English, 400 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir. 2005) (recognizing that equitable tolling should only apply in “rare and exceptional circumstances”). While the respondent may disagree with our decision, he has presented no arguments that convince us of a legal or factual error, or an argument that we overlooked.
 
Nor does the motion warrant reopening. The respondent has not demonstrated that the evidence attached to the motion is new or previously unavailable and material, where it consists of documents that are in the record or are substantially similar to evidence submitted with his prior motion. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 57-58; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).
 
ORDER: The motion and related stay request are denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Victoria Campos, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; administrative closure
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on March 4, 2003, after not appearing at his hearing. He appeals from the Immigration Judge’s April 16, 2015, decision denying his March 6, 2015, motion to reopen. The respondent also has requested administrative closure of these proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion will be denied.
 
The Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
In his appellate brief, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge incorrectly denied sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s and the Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). He states that his former attorney advised him not to appear at his hearing, and he has been a productive member of society. He further states that he is the beneficiary of an approved visa petition (Form I-130) filed by his United States citizen spouse and eligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver. In addition, the respondent argues that his spouse would suffer depression and hardship if he were removed from the United States. However, the respondent has not informed his former counsel of his ineffective assistance of counsel allegation and thus deprived counsel of the opportunity to respond. Moreover, the respondent has not exercised due diligence regarding his obligations before the Immigration Court. In light of the foregoing, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying sua sponte reopening of these proceedings.
 
Moreover, the respondent’s motion for administrative closure will be denied. Administrative closure is an administrative convenience that removes cases from the calendar and does not result in a final order. See Matter of Lopez-Barrios, 20 I&N Dec. 203 (BIA 1990); Matter of Amico, 19 I&N Dec. 652 (BIA 1988). A final order has already been entered. In addition, we decline to reopen these proceedings to grant administrative closure to await processing of a provisional unlawful presence waiver.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed, and the motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jonathan M. Hyman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kalin Ivany
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 4, 2014, denying his motion to reopen. The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge failed to take into consideration the impact of the Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a motion for summary affirmance. We will dismiss the appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The record shows that the respondent was placed in removal proceedings with the issuance of the Notice to Appear dated May 5, 2010. In a decision dated September 18, 2014, the Immigration Court granted respondent relief in the form of pre-conclusion voluntary departure for 120 days and also issued an alternate order of removal to Mexico if the respondent failed to depart on or before January 16, 2015. On November 26, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to reopen claiming that he may be eligible for a recently announced deferred action program. On December 2, 2014, DHS filed an Opposition to Respondent’s Motion to Reopen. The Immigration Judge denied the motion and the respondent timely appealed.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by failing to address his allegation that his previous counsel inadequately advised him of the consequences of accepting voluntary departure. Although the respondent indicates on appeal that he filed a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, the Immigration Judge correctly determined that, although the respondent raised this issue, he specifically disclaimed any ineffective assistance of counsel claim (I.J. at 1; Motion at 5). Accordingly, the Immigration Judge did not fail to address any claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent noted in his motion to reopen that he was basing his request to reopen his case for consideration of the announcement by the President of the United States of America of an imminent Executive Order calling for additional deferred action called DAPA. The Board finds that it need not reach the question of whether such executive action constitutes collateral relief outside the jurisdiction of the Immigration Judge because, in this case, that executive action is not currently available and it is speculative whether it will become available in the future.
 
The Immigration Judge properly noted that, at the hearing on September 18, 2014, the respondent received oral notice of the consequences of failing to voluntarily depart, including the consequences of filing a motion to reopen. The respondent’s voluntary departure order automatically terminates and converts to the alternate order of removal to Mexico. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(b)(E)(iii).
 
*2 Under the circumstances in this case, we find that the Immigration Judge did not err in denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael D. Steinberg
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on July 11, 2013, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. On October 1, 2015, the respondent filed a second, untimely motion to reopen seeking remand to pursue a waiver of inadmissibility. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the respondent’s motion. The respondent, in turn, has filed a reply to the DHS’ opposition. The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
Section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A), states that an alien may file one motion to reopen. The respondent’s current motion, however, is his second motion to reopen. The motion therefore is numerically barred.
 
Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, in turn, states that motions to reopen “““shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.” We entered the final administrative order of removal in the respondent’s case on February 6, 2013, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision pretermitting his application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). The respondent, however, did not file his current motion to reopen until more than 2 ½ years later. The respondent’s motion to reopen therefore is untimely.
 
The respondent does not claim that his motion fits within any of the statutory or regulatory exceptions to the time and numeric limits on motions. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) - (iv) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). The respondent instead argues that his motion is timely because it is based on a U visa waiver denial which constitutes new and previously unavailable evidence. In the alternative, the respondent claims that the ineffective assistance of his former attorney prevented him from pursuing a U visa at an earlier date and that he has acted diligently since discovering his eligibility for a U visa. Accordingly, he maintains that the time and numeric limits on his motion should be equitably tolled.
 
The respondent further contends that he has met the procedural requirements for reopening on the basis of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and he states that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of his former attorney because his former attorney’s errors prevented him from pursuing a U visa at an earlier date.
 
The respondent asks that his proceedings be reopened and remanded to the Immigration Judge so that he may renew, before the Immigration Judge, the waiver application he made in connection with his application for a U visa. The respondent claims that the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction over the waiver application and cites L.D.G. v. Holder, 744 F.3d 1022 (7th Cir. 2014), in support of this claim. The respondent also maintains that the ability to renew his waiver before the Immigration Judge is particularly important in his case due to the factual and legal errors the DHS made in adjudicating the waiver. Finally, the respondent requests sua sponte reopening in light of the exceptional circumstances and the humanitarian factors that exist in his case.
 
*2 We disagree with the respondent’s claims that his motion is not time or numerically barred. The discovery of new and previously unavailable evidence does not eliminate the time and numeric limits on motions to reopen. Further, the respondent has not established that reopening due to ineffective assistance of counsel and diligence is appropriate in his case. Any errors his former attorney made related to relief that is not available in removal proceedings, namely, a U visa and the accompanying waiver of inadmissibility under either section 212(d)(3)(A)(ii) or 212(d)(14) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(3)(A)(ii) or (d)(14). Accordingly, the alleged errors did not affect the outcome of the respondent’s removal proceeding or result in prejudice. See, e.g., Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793-94 (9th Cir. 2005) (stating that prejudice results when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings). The respondent, in fact, has been able to pursue a U visa and waiver of inadmissibility before the DHS and is still pursuing a motion to reconsider before that agency.
 
The respondent also argues that, while the DHS has exclusive jurisdiction over U visas and 212(d)(14) waivers, an Immigration Judge may consider his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(d)(3)(A)(ii) filled in conjunction with his U visa application. The case the respondent has cited in support of this argument, however, L.D.G. v. Holder, supra, is not controlling in the respondent’s case because his case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Further, as the DHS argues in its opposition to the respondent’s motion, we do not find L.D.G. v. Holder persuasive authority on this issue.
 
Finally, the respondent’s motion does not demonstrate an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretion to reopen his proceedings under our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997)(stating that “[t]he power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”).
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely, number-barred motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has filed an untimely and number-barred motion to reopen, through which he seeks reopening and rescission of the in absentia order of removal that was entered in his case on March 17, 2004, and raises a number of arguments regarding ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion. These proceedings will be reopened and the record remanded.
 
Considering the totality of circumstances presented in the respondent’s motion, we find it appropriate to exercise our discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Upon review of the record, it is not clear that the respondent was removable as charged at the time of the entry of the removal order, based on his 1985 conviction. See Ledezma-Galicia v. Holder, 636 F.3d 1059 (9th Cir. 2010). Moreover, even if removable, he was a long-time permanent resident of the United States who would have been eligible to pursue an application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). We are persuaded that the proceedings should be reopened and the in absentia order of removal rescinded. Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, these proceedings are reopened, and the in absentia order of removal is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael McFarland

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(B)

Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
AMENDED ORDER
 
This matter was previously before the Board on August 17, 2015, when we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s April 21, 2015, order of removal. The respondent now moves to reopen proceedings alleging ineffective assistance by her prior counsel. The Department of Homeland Security opposes reopening. The motion will be denied.
 
The record reflects that the respondent was convicted on January 30, 2014, of conspiracy in the fifth degree, in violation of New York Penal Law § 105.05, for which she received a sentence of one year (Exh. 2, Tab B). The record further reflects that on January 30, 2014, the respondent was convicted of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, in violation of New York Penal Law § 110-220.16(1), for which she received a sentence of 18 months (Exh. 2, Tab B). On April 21, 2015, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States based on her concession, through counsel, to the charges listed in the Notice to Appear, and her failure to apply for any relief from removal. The Board summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision on August 17, 2015, after the respondent did not raise any challenges to the Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
The respondent now moves to reopen proceedings alleging that her former attorney rendered ineffective assistance in failing to challenge the removal charges or apply for any relief from removal. As an initial matter, we note that the respondent has complied with the evidentiary requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).1 However, the respondent has not established that she was prejudiced by her former immigration counsel’s actions. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556-57 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 Although the respondent states that she would be eligible for relief from removal if her conviction was determined to not be not an aggravated felony, she provides no specific authority or argument that her conviction under New York Penal Law § 110-220.16(1), which involved possession with intent to sell narcotics, is not an aggravated felony. We also find that the respondent has not presented a prima facie case for relief to support a reopening of proceedings. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (the Board may deny a motion to reopen based upon a failure to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought).
 
As an aggravated felon, the respondent is ineligible for asylum or cancellation of removal. See sections 208(b)(2)(A)(ii), 208(b)(2)(B)(i), 240A(a)(3) of the Act. An aggravated felony involving unlawful trafficking in controlled substances is presumptively a particularly serious crime rendering an alien ineligible for withholding of removal. See section 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act, Matter of Y-L-, A-G-, R-S-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 270, 273-77 (A.G. 2002) (aggravated felonies involving unlawful trafficking in controlled substances are presumptively particularly serious crimes). The respondent has not put forth any argument to rebut application of the presumption in this case.
 
As for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), we do not find that the respondent has established a prima facie case for protection to support her motion to reopen. The respondent indicates that she fears two men who were involved in the trafficking of drugs with her and her husband. However, she makes no claim that these men have ties to the government in Ecuador, nor has she provided any evidence or argument to establish that the Ecuadorian government would acquiesce with or be willfully blind to any torture perpetrated against the respondent. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1) (torture under the CAT must be “inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity”).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kimberly J. Trupiano, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law (conceded)
 
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; voluntary departure; remand
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s December 16, 2014, decision, denying his application for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a), for failure to establish prima facie eligibility, and denying his alternative application for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), based on insufficient evidence of good moral character. During the pendency of this appeal, the respondent filed a motion, styled as a motion to reopen, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and requesting remand of the record. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded. The record will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issued de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The following facts are not in dispute. The respondent, a native and citizen of Tonga, entered the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor and remained longer than authorized (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 4; Exh. 1). He is the beneficiary of an approved Alien Relative Petition (Form I-130) filed on his behalf by his United States citizen wife (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 4). At a hearing held in 2013, the respondent indicated his intent to apply for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(a) of the Act based on the approved visa petition (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 11). The Immigration Judge scheduled a final hearing on the respondent’s adjustment application for September 15, 2014 (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 14-15, 17).
 
At the respondent’s September 15, 2014, hearing, his then-counsel requested a continuance because the adjustment application was incomplete: the fingerprints and medical examination had expired, and the affidavit of support for the sponsor and joint sponsor were deficient (I.J. at 3: Tr. at 17-20). See sections 212(a)(1), (2), and (4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1152(a)(1), (2), (4) (outlining health-related, criminal, and public charge grounds of inadmissibility). Over the DHS’s objection, the Immigration Judge continued the respondent’s case until December 16, 2014 (I.J. at 4; Tr. 19, 21). However, at the December 2014 hearing, problems persisted with the sufficiency of the affidavits of support (I.J. at 4; Tr. at 23-27). The Immigration Judge declined to further continue proceedings and instead concluded that the respondent had not established his statutory eligibility for adjustment of status (I.J. at 4; Tr. at 27). The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s alternate request for voluntary departure on good moral character grounds (I.J. at 8). See section 240B(b)(l)(B) of the Act; see also section 101(f) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f) (defining good moral character).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent alleges that his inability to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status and voluntary departure was due to the ineffective assistance of his prior attorney (Resp. Brief at 2; Resp. Motion to Reopen at 2-5). This is essentially a request for remand, with requirements similar to those for reopening. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-73 (BIA 1992). Generally, such a motion will not be granted unless it states new and material facts, is supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material, and establishes a prima facie case of statutory and discretionary eligibility for the underlying relief sought. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992); Maatougui v. Holder, 738 F.3d 1230, 1240-41 (10th Cir. 2013) (confirming that a motion to reopen should be supported by new evidence establishing a prima facie claim to relief); Osei v. INS, 305 F.3d 1205, 1208-09 (10th Cir. 2002); Matter of Coelho, supra.
 
In support of remand, the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements articulated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Osei v. INS, supra, at 1209 n.2. The respondent filed a state bar complaint against his former attorney, advised the former attorney of the allegations against him, and submitted a motion supported by an affidavit detailing how the attorney’s performance was deficient and impacted the respondent’s case.
 
Specifically, the respondent alleges that his former counsel did not prepare him for the hearing, did not request that his wife file her taxes, improperly recorded information on the affidavit of support, and did not ensure that the joint sponsor’s affidavit was duly executed or supported by proof of his United States citizenship, resulting in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent could not overcome the public charge ground in qualifying for adjustment of status (Resp. Motion to Reopen at 7-8, Tabs 41-46; Tr. at 17-18, 20, 24-27). See section 212(a)(4) of the Act; section 213A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1183a (outlining the statutory requirements for the affidavit of support); 8 C.F.R. §§ 213a.2(a)(l)(i)(A), (ii), (v), (b)(1), (c)(l)(i)(C), (c)(2), (ii) (for the various requirements related to proper execution of the affidavit of support, who may file the affidavit of support, and the evidence required to demonstrate sufficient income in support of the affidavit). With his motion, the respondent also included a letter from an accountant stating that the accountant is working with the respondent’s wife to file her back taxes (Resp. Motion to Reopen at Tab 33). The respondent also alleges he was prejudiced when his attorney did not prepare him for questioning about his 2010 arrest, and that numerous family members would have testified on his behalf as to his good moral character if they had been asked to do so-- factors relevant to the Immigration Judge’s denial of voluntary departure for lack of good moral character (Resp. Motion to Reopen at Tabs 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22; I.J. at 6-8; Tr. at 27-51). See section 240B(b)(l)(B) of the Act.
 
*3 We find that remand is warranted in the interests of justice. The respondent has demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s lack of preparation and communication with the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.102(o), (r) (requiring an attorney before the Immigration Court to adequately prepare for all proceedings and maintain communication with the respondent); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640; see also Ochieng v. Mukasey, 520 F.3d 1110, 1115 (10th Cir. 2008) (requiring the respondent to demonstrate prejudice in order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel warranting remand). Here, for instance, the respondent’s prior counsel: (1) did not adequately inform him of the documents required to present a sufficient affidavit of support even after certain deficiencies were identified by the Immigration Judge; (2) did not prepare him for questions he might be asked about his criminal history in qualifying for voluntary departure; and (3) openly acknowledged the affidavit of support was deficient (Tr. at 17-21, 25-27; Resp. Motion to Reopen at 31-46). Moreover, prior counsel proffered no persuasive evidence to rebut the ineffective assistance claim, even though the attorney was notified of the respondent’s allegations. Many of the identified errors in prior counsel’s performance have been rectified by current counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we express no opinion as to the ultimate merits of the respondent’s applications for relief. In light of our disposition of this matter, we decline to address the respondent’s assertions on appeal that the record, as it was constituted before the Immigration Judge, supported a grant of adjustment of status or voluntary departure.
 
Upon remand, the parties will have an opportunity to supplement the record with any documentation or testimony they may choose to present relevant to the respondent’s applications for relief. However, we remind the respondent and his counsel that he is responsible for presenting a complete application for relief supported by the requisite documentary evidence. Failure to follow this instruction and any directives issued by the Immigration Judge may result in a finding that he is statutorily ineligible for any requested forms of relief. See, e.g., Matter of Interiano-Rosa, 25 I&N Dec. 264, 266 (BIA 2010).
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER; The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jaime Jasso, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)] - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)] - Crime involving moral turpitude
 
 
APPLICATION: Termination; remand
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s June 27, 2014, decision ordering him removed from the United States. The respondent requests that the matter be remanded to the Immigration Judge to allow the record to be supplemented with missing transcripts. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent, a native and citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, who became a lawful permanent resident of the United States in 1981, was properly charged as an arriving alien because he departed the United States in 2005, and did not return until 2008, thus abandoning his residency (I.J. at 2-3; Exh. 7). Accordingly, the Immigration Judge sustained the charged of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), and ordered the respondent removed to Trinidad and Tobago. The Immigration Judge did not make a determination as the respondent’s inadmissibility under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act (I.J. at 3).
 
The respondent does not challenge the finding of removability on appeal, but rather argues that he has been deprived of due process in his immigration proceedings because the transcripts of record are missing hearings from the first 2 years of his proceedings (Resp. Br. at 1-4). He argues that, as a result, he has been prevented from fully challenging his order of removal, and establishing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim (Resp. Br. at 1-4, 6-8, 11-12).
 
As the respondent correctly points out on appeal, missing transcripts are not a per se violation of due process (Resp. Br. at 9-10). United States v. Medina, 236 F.3d 1028, 1031-32 (9th Cir. 2001) (explaining, in an illegal reentry case, that missing immigration transcripts did not violate due process in immigration proceedings). In order to establish that a violation of due process has occurred, the respondent must still establish that the missing transcripts rendered his proceedings fundamentally unfair and that he was prejudiced as a result of that unfairness. Id.; see also Dent v. Holder, 627 F.3d 365, 373 (9th Cir. 2010); Colmenar v. INS, 210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 We are not persuaded that the respondent has been prevented from reasonably presenting his case on appeal in such a way that rendered his proceedings fundamentally unfair. While the absence of a transcript of proceedings surely affects the nature of appellate review, it does not completely deprive the alien of all means of challenging the errors below. United States v. Medina, supra, at 1032. The respondent could have explained the presence of errors below through his memory, other evidence in the record, or witness testimony. See id. The respondent has not attempted to do so here, and thus he has not shown that he was prevented from fully presenting his case. See id.
 
Furthermore, even if he had established a fundamental unfairness in the proceedings, he must still establish that he suffered prejudice as a result. In the context of missing transcripts, an alien must do more than offer a “vague assertion that, if a tape recording was available, he might be able to locate some defect in the proceeding.” Id. Here, rather than asserting that ineffective assistance of counsel had occurred, the respondent asserts that he believes he may have suffered ineffective assistance of counsel, but that he needs the missing transcripts to determine the nature of his claim (Notice of Appeal, Resp. Br. at 11-12). Without more of an assertion from the respondent about how he believes he was deficiently represented, we conclude that his claims on appeal amount to no more than speculation as to his plausible grounds for relief, which is insufficient to show prejudice. Id.; see also United States v. Corrales-Beltran, 192 F.3d 1311, 1318-19 (9th Cir. 1999); United States v. Alvarado-Delgado, 98 F.3d 492, 493 (9th Cir. 1996).
 
This is particularly true where, contrary to the respondent’s assertions on appeal, the respondent need not strictly comply with the filing and reporting requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), if ineffective assistance of counsel is plain on the face of the record (Resp. Br. at 11-12). See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 597-98 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent does not assert in any meaningful way that ineffective assistance was plain on the face of the record; nor does he allege what he believes the missing transcripts would prove, if they were produced. Accordingly, the respondent has not established that the missing transcripts prevented him from establishing his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
We also disagree with the respondent that he was prejudiced because the record contains no evidence of the charges against him or his plea to those charges. The Notice to Appear is contained in the record at Exh. 1. Further, while it appears that the respondent did enter earlier pleadings through his attorney, that were contained in the missing transcripts, he also submitted subsequent written pleadings (Exh. 16). The Immigration Judge acknowledged and relied on those written pleadings in rendering his decision (Exh. 16; Tr. at 17; IJ at 2). The respondent does not allege any error of his prior counsel in submitting these pleadings or explain why these are insufficient to establish the charges and his pleadings. Accordingly, the respondent has not established a due process violation that requires remand of this matter. The following orders will be entered.
  
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jered Dobbs, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In a decision rendered March 9, 2015, the Immigration Judge denied a joint motion to reopen and terminate proceedings without prejudice filed by the respondent and the Department of Homeland Security (the DHS) on August 8, 2014. The respondent timely appealed that decision. The appeal will be sustained and the parties’ joint motion to terminate will be granted.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, under the “““clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgement, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, entered the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor in 2001 (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). The respondent married a United States citizen and adjusted his status to that of a conditional permanent resident in 2005 (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). The respondent did not timely apply to remove the conditions on his residency; his joint petition to remove the conditions was filed approximately two years after the relevant deadline (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1; Joint Motion, Tab C). United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) denied the petition because it determined that there was not good cause for the late filing, and the DHS commenced these removal proceedings through issuance of a Notice to Appear, charging the respondent as removable because his conditional permanent resident status had been terminated (Exh. 1). Before an Immigration Judge, the respondent conceded his removability and sought to renew his joint petition to remove the conditions on his residency (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge set a date for the respondent to file the petition with the Immigration Court, accompanied by proof that the requisite filing fee had been paid (I.J. at 2). He did not file the petition; on February 15, 2012, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed (I.J. at 2; Joint Motion, Tab F).
 
In August 2014, the respondent and the DHS filed a joint motion to reopen and terminate proceedings before the Immigration Court, so the respondent could pursue adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255, before USCIS (I.J. at 2). Along with the motion, the respondent submitted: (1) evidence that his wife, through whom he originally obtained his conditional resident status, had filed a new visa petition on his behalf; (2) voluminous documentation of their eight year marriage; (3) a note from his former lawyer suggesting the prior attorney was responsible for the failure to file the petition to remove conditions before the Immigration Judge; and (4) his statement (Joint Motion, Tabs A, G, I, J).
 
*2 The Immigration Judge, observing the motion was not time or number barred because it was jointly filed, denied the motion because the respondent had not submitted proof that the visa petition had been approved, and thus the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent could not establish prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act (I.J. at 3-4). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iv). To the extent that the respondent’s former lawyer was at fault, the Immigration Judge found the respondent had not complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), in making a formal claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (I.J. at 4).
 
We disagree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that reopening and termination without prejudice is not warranted in this case (I.J. at 3-4). Notably, an agreement between the respondent and the DHS on an issue regarding the proper course of action “should, in most instances, be determinative.” See Matter of Yewondwosen, 21 I&N Dec. 1025, 1026 (BIA 1997). Here, the Immigration Judge concluded that the joint motion of the parties could not overcome the respondent’s failure to demonstrate prima facie adjustment eligibility because he did not have an approved visa petition (I.J. at 4 n.1). However, the standard for reopening is met when “the evidence reveals a reasonable likelihood that the statutory requirements for relief have been satisfied. . . . We have not required a conclusive showing that eligibility for relief has been established.” Matter of S-V-, 22 I&N Dec. 1306 (BIA 2000) (citing Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 419 (BIA 1996) (emphasis added). In addition, contrary to the Immigration Judge’s assertion that an approved visa petition is a necessary prerequisite for reopening, we have specifically found reopening to be appropriate where a pending visa petition is supported by evidence establishing a sufficient likelihood that the visa petition will be approved. See, e.g., Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253, 256 (BIA 2002). In this case, there is a reasonable likelihood of the visa petition being approved, given the respondent remains married to the same spouse through whom he obtained his conditional permanent residence nearly 10 years ago. Matter of S-V-, supra.
 
Therefore, given the joint motion and the respondent’s evidence that the visa petition is likely to be granted, we will reopen these proceedings and terminate them without prejudice pursuant to the parties’ request. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
*3 FURTHER ORDER: The parties’ joint motion to reopen is granted, and the instant proceedings are reopened and terminated without prejudice at the joint request of the parties.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ernest Bradley Westerhold, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael A. Mansfield
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Termination
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, has appealed the August 15, 2017, decision of the Immigration Judge finding him removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has also filed a timely motion to remand the record so that he may present a motion to terminate before the Immigration Judge. The DHS has not responded to this motion.
 
The respondent’s motion is supported by evidence that the 11th Circuit Judicial Court in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida, vacated the respondent’s nolo contendere plea underlying his conviction pursuant to Florida Statute 827.03(2), based on due process violations regarding ineffective assistance of counsel. Given the evidence presented, we find that the respondent’s vacated conviction may not be considered a conviction for immigration purposes. Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010); Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006); Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003).
 
Given that the respondent’s conviction served as the sole basis for his removability, we find no need to remand the record to the Immigration Court, and we hereby terminate proceedings. The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s proceedings are terminated.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Kenya. The Board dismissed his appeal on September 26, 2013, and thereafter denied several motions. On November 13, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel of former counsel. The motion is denied.
 
The pending motion is untimely filed, as well as number-barred, and no exception to these restrictions placed by law on motions to reopen removal proceedings has been shown to be applicable here. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Further, we find no basis to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
We decline to equitably toll the time and number bar because the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). He argues that former counsel failed to continue to object to the admissibility of a Form I-9, and that this was ineffective assistance. We disagree. It is settled that a Form I-9 is admissible in immigration proceedings to support charges of removability against an alien and to determine his or her eligibility for relief from removal. Matter of Bett, 26 I. & N. Dec. 437 (BIA 2014).
 
Furthermore, it has been over 2 years since the appeal was dismissed, and the respondent has not adequately explained why he delayed in raising his current claims. See Rodriquez-Manzano, 666 F.3d 948, 955 n.7 (5th Cir. 2012) (regarding ineffective assistance, “current regulations impose what is effectively a due diligence requirement on post-1992 cases...”). There is, therefore, no basis for abrogating the motions deadline. Accordingly, the motion is denied. The request for a stay is denied as moot.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pamela Brown Blackburn, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Chandu Latey
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Federated States of Micronesia, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s January 13, 2015, decision, denying his request for voluntary departure. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. At the outset, we find that the respondent does not meaningfully contest the Immigration Judge’s legal conclusion that he is statutorily ineligible to apply for asylum and withholding of removal under sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158, 1231(b)(3), and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) (Notice of Appeal at 2; Respondent’s Brief).2 The respondent likewise does not meaningfully contest the Immigration Judge’s denial of voluntary departure or his request for a continuance. Therefore, we deem those issues waived. See, e.g., Matter of Cervantes, 22 I&N Dec. 560, 561 n.1 (BIA 1999) (expressly declining to address an issue not raised by party on appeal); Matter of Gutierrez, 19 I&N Dec. 562, 565 n.3 (BIA 1988) (same).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion in finding him removable. The respondent claims that the guilty plea which he entered in connection with his 2002 conviction for attempted rape in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Superior Court, in violation of 6 CMC sections 1301 and 301, was not knowingly given because his criminal attorney failed to advise him of the immigration consequences of his conviction (Respondent’s Br. at 3). The respondent represents on appeal that after his hearing, he filed a Petition for a Writ of Coram Nobis in CNMI on May 20, 2015, which is still pending.
 
We dismiss this contention. The respondent did not challenge the use of his 2002 criminal conviction in these proceedings. The respondent, in fact, admitted to the allegation in the Notice to Appear (NTA) concerning this conviction and conceded his removability on both grounds lodged against him, including for having been convicted (or having committed) a crime involving moral turpitude (Tr. at 20, 25, 35-36), See Notice to Appear at 3. See also section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Accordingly, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination of removability based on the record. We have held, moreover, that an alien waives his opportunity to pursue an issue on appeal when he fails to raise it before the Immigration Judge at his hearing. See Matter of R-S-H, 23 I&N Dec. 629, 638 (BIA 2003). Since the respondent raised no objection to the use of his 2002 conviction in these proceedings, he waived this issue for review on appeal.
 
*2 Moreover, the respondent’s claim that his conviction may not be used to determine his removability is without merit because while an alien is free to file a motion to vacate his criminal conviction before the criminal court pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010),3 the filing of a post-conviction motion does not render the conviction non-final for immigration purposes. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323 (BIA 1996); Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
Finally, we understand the respondent’s fear of being removed and thus, being unable to obtain the necessary medical care he needs for his serious health issues (Respondent’s Brief). However, the Board and the Immigration Judges have limited jurisdiction and can grant only those forms of relief from removal that are expressly authorized by Congress. See Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734 (BIA 1988); Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348 (BIA 1982). We have no power to grant equitable remedies or to confer general humanitarian relief on aliens. If the respondent wishes to pursue relief on humanitarian grounds, he is not precluded from seeking additional consideration from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). For the foregoing reasons, the decision below is affirmed, and we find that the respondent has not established that these proceedings were fundamentally unfair to remand the record for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Footnotes

1

Proceedings before the Immigration Judge in this matter were completed in Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), where the case was docketed for hearing (see OPPM No. 04-06) and where the hearing notice directed the respondent to appear via video teleconference pursuant to section 240(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act. The Immigration Judge conducted the hearing remotely from Honolulu, Hawaii.

2

Even if we to address these issues, the respondent did not express any fear of persecution or torture to qualify for relief or protection (I.J. at 2: Tr. at 37). The only fear expressed by the respondent related to his fear that if removed, he would be unable to obtain the medical treatment which he needs.

3

In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010), the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ginger E. Jacobs, Esquire
*1 The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal on March 26, 2014. We found that the Immigration Judge properly denied his request for a continuance to await adjudication of a U visa application, which is for certain victims of physical or mental abuse. Section 101(a)(15)(U) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U). We found no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent had not demonstrated that he was the victim of a qualifying crime, that the respondent had not demonstrated that he had experienced substantial physical or mental abuse as the result of being a victim of a crime, and that the respondent had not shown prima facie eligibility for a U visa as he had not obtained a law enforcement certification, and the U visa application had not been filed with the DHS. The respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen on October 9, 2015, and later made a supplemental filing. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion to reopen, to which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded, will be denied.
 
According to the motion, the respondent was removed to Mexico on April 24, 2015, and currently resides there (Respondent’s Mot. at 6, 9). Even if the motion were to be deemed timely filed, and within the Board’s jurisdiction notwithstanding the respondent’s removal, see Toor v. Lynch, 789 F.3d 1055 (9th Cir. 2015), the motion would be denied.
 
The respondent claims that former counsel Patricia G. Mejia was ineffective because she did not file a timely petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, concerning our March 26, 2014, decision (Respondent’s Mot. at 9-11; Exh. D).1 In Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir. 2000), the Ninth Circuit found that where an alien is prevented from filing an appeal in immigration proceedings due to counsel’s error, and is thereby deprived of appellate proceedings entirely, such error mandates a presumption of prejudice inasmuch as the adversary process itself has been rendered presumptively unreliable. See Salazar-Gonzalez v. Lynch, 798 F.3d 917, 921-22 (9th Cir. 2015). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009)(the Board has discretion, pending rulemaking, “““to consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel based on conduct of counsel that occurred after a final order of removal had been entered”). While the failure to file a timely petition for review with the Ninth Circuit raises a presumption of prejudice, in this case that presumption has been rebutted. The respondent does not show how the Board’s March 26, 2014, decision (which, as noted, affirmed an Immigration Judge’s discretionary denial of a continuance pending adjudication of a U visa) would have been subject to challenge before the Ninth Circuit.
 
*2 The respondent conversely argues that counsel did not inform him that filing a Ninth Circuit petition for review would revoke the grant of voluntary departure, under section 240B(b) of the Act (Respondent’s Mot. at 12; Respondent’s Affidavit). However, the respondent understands English, and this was explained in the Board’s March 26, 2014, decision (Tr. at 1, 5, 13).2
 
The motion also argues that former counsel provided ineffective assistance, by not requesting a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion from the DHS (Respondent’s Mot. at 12-13). However, an application for prosecutorial discretion is a collateral matter involving the DHS’ independent exercise of discretion, and is outside the jurisdiction of the Immigration Court or Board, see, e.g., Matter of G-N-C-, 22 I&N Dec. 281 (BIA 1998); Matter of Singh, 21 I&N Dec. 427, 435 (BIA 1996). Therefore, this claimed deficiency in representation is insufficient to demonstrate ineffective assistance in the proceedings before the Immigration Court or Board.
 
The motion additionally argues that former counsel was ineffective, because she did not pursue a stay of removal with the DHS, after the Ninth Circuit court dismissed his appeal as untimely (Respondent’s Mot. at 14). However, this alleged ineffective assistance of counsel is beyond the scope and jurisdiction of the removal proceedings, as it allegedly occurred after the completion of the removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge and Board.
 
As the respondent has not shown that reopening is warranted in this matter, the pending motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Peter E. Torres, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Claudia Ochoa
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative decision on August 28, 2014, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying a previous motion to reopen these proceedings in which the respondent was ordered removed in absentia on May 16, 2000. The respondent again seeks reopening. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied as untimely and number-barred, as the respondent filed it beyond the 180-day exceptional circumstances deadline, and has not demonstrated that an exception to the time and number limits applies. See Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i) and (c)(7)(C).
 
The respondent urges equitably tolling of the time and number limits for motions to reopen, because he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In particular, the respondent avers that he did not attend his hearing, because prior counsel did not mail the notice of hearing to the respondent’s address. See generally Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir. 2008) (in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is construed as a challenge to the Board’s discretionary sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings); United States v. English, 400 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir. 2005) (recognizing that equitable tolling should only apply in “rare and exceptional circumstances”).
 
We are not persuaded of any material error with counsel’s purported typographical error in the respondent’s mailing address. Nor has the respondent demonstrated the requisite due diligence in raising ineffective assistance, where he waited 14 years to present the claim. See De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir.2004) (observing that prevailing on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires substantial prejudice). Notably, prior counsel filed a motion to withdraw from representing the respondent, because the respondent was uncooperative, did not maintain contact, and did not fulfill his contractual agreement. See Motion to Withdraw as Counsel, dated May 16, 2000. Under the circumstances, the respondent has not shown deficient representation of prior counsel or diligent pursuit of the claim.
 
Nor has the respondent demonstrated exceptional circumstances warranting sua sponte reopening. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay is denied as moot.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maria Isabel Martinez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anastasie M. Sénat
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated September 21, 2015, denying a requested continuance and ordering his removal from the United States. The respondent’s appeal, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent does not contest that he is, at the present time, subject to removal from the United States as charged on the Notice to Appear under the provisions of sections 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) and (a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(A)(2)(a)(I)(i) and (a)(6)(A)(i). I.J. at 3; Exh. 1. He also does not contend that, at the present time, he has requested any form of relief from removal which can be granted to him in these proceedings. The issue raised on appeal is whether the Immigration Judge should have granted a requested further continuance.
 
The respondent’s desire to pursue an appeal of his conviction or post-conviction relief with the Indiana courts, with the desired result of vacating his conviction, rendering him potentially eligible for discretionary relief, does not amount to “good cause” warranting a continuance of these removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. We note that the respondent was given several continuances, for attorney preparation time and for time to file for post-conviction relief in the Indiana court in which he was convicted. Tr. at 6, 13, 19, 30. While the respondent has described the basis on which he is pursuing post-conviction relief, to include a detailed assessment of the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel in criminal proceedings in state court, his pursuit of post-conviction relief remains speculative. I.J. at 4-5. As such, we conclude that the respondent’s post-conviction relief claims do not warrant a continuance of these proceedings. See Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 815 (BIA 2012) (recognizing that an alien should not be granted a continuance “as a dilatory tactic to forestall the conclusion of removal proceedings”); see also Pawlowski v. Holder, 482 F.App’x. 162, 165 (7th Cir. 2012) (holding that it is permissible to decline to grant a continuance of removal proceedings based upon an alien’s unsubstantiated speculation that he might receive post-conviction relief).
 
*2 If the respondent believes that he should be permitted to remain in this country while he exhausts his post-conviction remedies, he is not precluded from requesting a stay of removal from the DHS. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.6. However, as the respondent’s arguments on appeal do not persuade this Board to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to enter an order of removal in this case, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge in this matter were completed at a detention facility in Kenosha, Wisconsin (see OPPM No. 04-06). The Immigration Judge conducted the hearings there remotely from the Immigration Court in Chicago, Illinois, via video teleconference pursuant to section 240(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David Gamez, Esquire
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. He has appealed a decision, mailed on August 6, 2015, in which an Immigration Judge denied his motion to reopen. The respondent has filed a brief concerning the decision of the Immigration Judge, while the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
The respondent was found subject to removal as an aggravated felon, based on a 2004 Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation. He was ordered removed on September 15, 2005, and was removed the following day. He was again removed from the United States on January 3, 2014.
 
The respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on June 8, 2015. Section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b); I.J. at 2. He argued that his burglary conviction had been vacated on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.1
 
The respondent sought to have the Immigration Judge reopen his case under the judge’s sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). However, the Immigration Judge correctly found that he lacked jurisdiction to reopen the proceedings sua sponte, due to the respondent’s removal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); I.J. at 2. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d), relating to motions before the Board, is invalid because it contradicts statutory language permitting one motion to reopen removal proceedings with no restriction on the location from which it is filed. Garcia-Carias v. Holder, 697 F.3d 257 (5th Cir. 2012). The respondent’s motion, filed many years late, was not filed pursuant to the statute, but rather sought to have the Immigration Judge reopen these removal proceedings sua sponte. Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, 330 F.3d 672, 675 (5th Cir. 2003) (Board acted reasonably in determining that the departure regulation deprived it of its regulatory power to reopen or reconsider decisions sua sponte); Ovalles v. Holder, 577 F.3d 288, 292-93 (5th Cir. 2009).
 
*2 The appeal will, therefore, be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The Immigration Judge correctly found that the respondent did not present evidence which would show why the criminal court dismissed the respondent’s conviction on February 5, 2015. I.J. at 1-2. The respondent attached to his brief the criminal court judge’s memorandum, which states that criminal counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel.

December 15, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alary E. Piibe, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(C), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C)] - Controlled substance trafficker
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated May 8, 2014, denying his motion to reopen the proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against him on May 12, 1999. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including any determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent received proper notice of his removal hearing because he was personally served with the Notice to Appear along with notice of the time, date, and location of the hearing. Section 239(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a). With respect to his claim of exceptional circumstances, the respondent’s motion is untimely because he did not file his motion within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s decision. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge properly declined to equitably toll the applicable filing requirements based on the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The doctrine of equitable tolling applies when “despite all due diligence, [the party invoking equitable tolling] is unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of the claim.” Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001). Here, the respondent had been put on notice that he was in removal proceedings and was scheduled to appear for a hearing on May 12, 1999, when he was personally served with the Notice to Appear, along with notice of the time and date of the hearing, on April 25, 1999. The respondent’s claim that he spoke with an attorney on the telephone after he returned to the United States in 2000 (which would have been more than 180 days after the Immigration Judge’s May 12, 1999, decision) does not establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent bears the burden of establishing a basis for rescinding and reopening, and he has not provided sufficient details to make his claim persuasive. Nor did the respondent show substantial compliance with the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Finally, the respondent did not show that he acted with the due diligence required for equitable tolling where his motion was filed 14 years after the filing deadline had passed. It was unreasonable for the respondent to take no steps to reopen his case for well over a decade based on the statement of an attorney who apparently declined to represent him. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir 2003) (person seeking to toll period for filing motion to reopen must show he has acted with due diligence).
 
*2 Finally, the respondent has not established an “exceptional” situation sufficient to warrant sua sponte reopening of the proceedings. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The respondent acknowledges in his motion that a Form I-213 (Exh. 2), detailing the basis for the removal charge, had been admitted into evidence at the 1999 hearing (Respondent’s motion at 4-5; I.J. at 2). Moreover, the respondent’s arguments regarding the sufficiency of the Immigration Judge’s decision could have been made years ago. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed

File: AXXX XX3 501 - Oakdale, LA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Drayton D. Berkley, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lorraine L. Griffin
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent, who is a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s August 31, 2015, decision denying his motion to reopen these removal proceedings. The respondent filed a brief concerning the decision of the Immigration Judge, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a “Motion for Summary Affirmance”.1 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
On March 3, 2009, the respondent was charged with being subject to removal under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), in that he arrived in the United States at some point in 2003 or 2004, and was not then admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer. An Immigration Judge issued an order of removal on April 22, 2009, which stated that the respondent had made no application for relief from removal. The respondent waived the right to appeal to the Board.
 
Six years later, on August 5, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. The respondent brought a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against Timothy Flowers, an attorney who has been suspended from practice by this Board. The respondent in an affidavit claimed that Flowers did not return his phone calls, never came to see him in detention, and did not appear in Immigration Court.
 
At the April 22, 2009, removal hearing, the respondent stated in his affidavit, he appeared in Immigration Court without Flowers and “consented to removal”. Absent Flowers’ inaction, the respondent claimed, he might have been able to have the removal proceedings “cancelled”. According to his motion, Flowers erred by not filing an application to cancel removal, apparently pursuant to section 240A(b) of the Act, due to extreme hardship that would occur to the respondent’s family upon his removal (Respondent’s Mot. at paras. 13, 26-27).
 
The Immigration Judge in denying reopening correctly found that the motion was untimely filed. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1)(motion must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order). The Immigration Judge also properly concluded that the respondent did not establish exceptional circumstances which would warrant sua sponte reopening under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b) (I.J. at 2). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). That is, at the April 22, 2009, removal hearing, the respondent was given an opportunity to continue the hearing until counsel was available, but elected to proceed without representation (I.J. at 3). Thus, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was without merit. Id.
 
*2 The Immigration Judge also properly concluded, in denying reopening, that the respondent’s motion to reopen did not establish eligibility for relief from removal. Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247, 251 (BIA 2007). That is, the motion to reopen filed with the Immigration Judge indicated that the respondent wished to seek cancellation of removal for nonpermanent residents under section 240A(b) of the Act, but the respondent did not establish the required 10 years of continuous physical presence in the United States. Sections 240A(b)(1)(A) and 240A(d)(1) of the Act.2 The respondent does not argue otherwise in his brief.
 
As for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, the respondent did not argue in his motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge that this relief should have been granted by the Immigration Judge in 2009. While the respondent argues in his brief that he should have been advised about the possibility of seeking voluntary departure, he does not set out how he would have established eligibility for such relief before the Immigration Judge at his April 22, 2009, removal hearing.
 
The respondent claims that the Immigration Judge did not consider how the respondent might be granted “a waiver of [in]admissibility for humanitarian or family purposes.” With regard to humanitarian relief, however, the Immigration Judge and Board have limited jurisdiction and can grant only those forms of relief from removal that are expressly authorized by Congress. Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734 (BIA 1988). If the respondent seeks a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion, he must direct his request to the DHS.
 
The respondent’s brief contends that he filed a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge on September 29, 2015, and that the Immigration Judge has failed to consider it. Such motion is attached to the respondent’s brief, although it is barely legible. As the respondent filed an appeal with this Board, jurisdiction vested with us, and the Immigration Judge committed no error in not addressing the motion to reconsider. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). We moreover find no basis for disturbing the decision of the Immigration Judge, after reviewing the motion to reconsider.
 
The appeal will, therefore, be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent’s brief was not paginated as required by the Board of Immigration Appeals Practice Manual, § 3.3(c)(iii) (Aug. 8, 2014) (“Briefs and other submissions should always be paginated”).

Given our analysis as to how the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, we need not consider whether the judge also correctly determined that the respondent failed to comply with the procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stacy Tolchin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Elly Laff
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This matter was before the Board on September 29, 2015, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent filed the present motion to reconsider our decision and to reopen proceedings on October 22, 2015, and filed supplemental materials that the Board received on November 4, 2015. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
In this matter, the Immigration Judge entered the removal order in 2006 and the respondent moved to reopen in the Immigration Court in 2015, approximately 9 years later. The Board affirmed the denial of reopening on grounds that the motion was untimely and that the respondent had not demonstrated an exceptional situation to warrant sua sponte reopening. In seeking reconsideration, the respondent argues that since there is no regulatory time limit for reopening sua sponte, his motion was denied for failure to meet a non-existent regulatory deadline. This is incorrect; sua sponte reopening was denied not for timeliness but for lack of an exceptional situation. The present motion does not identify any error of law or fact in our decision or argument that was overlooked. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); see also Matter of 0-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 58 (BIA 2006). The motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
The respondent also seeks reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board held in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), that due process rights may be violated, and the time and numerical limits for filing a motion to reopen may be tolled, when ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from reasonably presenting his case. An alien seeking reopening for ineffective assistance must show that he acted with due diligence. See Iturribarria v. I.N.S., 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003); Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090, 1096-97 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding that alien failed to act with due diligence in waiting 6 months after adverse Board decision before consulting with another attorney). Equitable tolling of a filing deadline is a form of relief that is extended “only sparingly” even in situations where a claimant has “actively pursued” his remedies. Irwin v. Dep’t of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990). Even if counsel’s performance was deficient (a question we do not decide), the respondent has not shown that he actively pursued his remedies; in particular, there is no satisfactory explanation for the delay of more than 1 year in moving to reopen after the respondent obtained post-conviction relief in a state criminal matter. The motion to reopen will therefore be denied as barred by the applicable statutory and regulatory time and number limits.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey A. Devore, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Temporary Protected Status
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals the May 22, 2013, decision of the Immigration Judge denying and deeming abandoned his application for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and ordering him removed from the United States. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge for a new hearing. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
The record before the Board indicates that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) denied the respondent’s application for TPS in 2004 for failure to document his eligibility. See Tr. at 20; Motion to Remand, Tabs A, B. The respondent through counsel filed a new TPS application with USCIS in 2012, even though he was then in removal proceedings. See Motion, Tabs O - Q. In the Immigration Court, the respondent submitted only the application form, without any supporting evidence or documentation. The Immigration Judge issued an order of removal, but also advised the respondent that he would grant a timely-filed motion to reopen with an application for TPS or cancellation of removal. See Tr. at 31-33. The respondent did not file a motion to reopen.
 
The respondent’s appeal brief and present motion to remand claim ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board held in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), that due process rights may be violated when ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from reasonably presenting his case and prejudice results. In Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), we held that an alien must show prejudice resulting from the ineffective assistance and will not establish prejudice if he does not document that he is eligible for the relief sought. See also Figeroa v. I.N.S., 886 F.2d 76 (4th Cir. 1989) (holding that even in a clear case of ineffective assistance, the alien must establish prejudice by providing objective evidence that he is entitled to relief).
 
The brief and motion do not document that the respondent is eligible for TPS. The appeal brief makes a conclusory claim of eligibility and the motion addresses counsel’s performance,1 but nowhere does the respondent point to documents establishing his eligibility. Prejudice from ineffective assistance is not shown.
 
The respondent cites Matter of Interiano-Rosa, 25 I&N Dec. 264 (BIA 2010), in arguing that the TPS application should not have been denied or deemed abandoned for failure to file supporting evidence. In that case, the alien timely filed his application for relief and timely filed numerous supporting documents, although he failed to file some documents as directed by the Immigration Judge. The Board held on these facts that the application should be adjudicated on the basis of the testimony and the timely-filed documents. In the present matter, the respondent filed no supporting documents at all (I.J. at 1). The Immigration Judge was correct in holding that the respondent’s testimony alone could not have established his eligibility for TPS (id.), as TPS requires documentation of eligibility in all cases. Therefore, the Immigration Judge properly pretermitted the respondent’s unsupported application.
 
*2 For the above reasons, the Board will affirm the removal order and deny the motion to remand.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jennifer Oltarsh, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 11, 2014, denying her motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously granted the respondent voluntary departure at a hearing held on January 18, 2006. We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
In her motion to reopen, the respondent asserts that she was misadvised by the accredited representative who requested only voluntary departure on her behalf at the January 18, 2006, hearing. The respondent further asserts that after the hearing she immediately retained new counsel to file a motion to reopen, but that attorney failed to file the motion and misled her regarding its status. In denying the respondent’s motion to reopen filed on July 3, 2014, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent was questioned regarding voluntary departure at her final removal hearing and was provided an opportunity to ask questions of her own. However, the Immigration Judge did not sufficiently address the ineffective assistance of counsel claims raised in the respondent’s motion to reopen. Under the particular circumstances of this case, we find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of these claims and the entry of a new decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (limiting the Board’s fact-finding ability on appeal); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; rescission
 
*1 On January 26, 2015, the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s October 29, 2014, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal entered on August 27, 2002. On April 22, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and rescind with the Board. On July 21, 2015, the Board denied the motion, and on September 14, 2015 the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen and reconsider with the Board. The motion will be denied.
 
In his prior motion before the Board, the respondent offered an affidavit in which he stated that he never received any notices from any government office for his removal hearing. The Board found the respondent’s affidavit to be inconsistent with his affidavit submitted in support of his motion before the Immigration Judge in which he stated that he did not have any problems with the mail at his address of record.
 
In his prior motion before the Board, the respondent also set forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), against the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Judge and on appeal before the Board, Martha E. Garza, Esquire. The respondent asserted that he did not tell Attorney Garza that he did not have problems with the mail at his address of record; Attorney Garza prepared the affidavit in English; and Attorney Garza had him sign the affidavit without having read it to him in Spanish. In response to the allegations against her, Attorney Garza stated that in accordance with her office’s routine practice, the affidavit was read to the respondent in Spanish for corrections and signature. Attorney Garza also reminded the respondent that he met and consulted with a former associate of the firm, Raed Gonzalez.
 
Raed Gonzalez is the respondent’s current attorney. With the instant motion, Attorney Gonzalez has offered a notarized affidavit in which he states that he was not personally involved with the respondent’s case when he was employed in the office of Attorney Garza, and he attests that “it was never (Attorney Garza’s) routine policy nor routine practice at the office to consistently read affidavits back to non-English speaking clients in their native language.” Attorney Gonzalez further states that “[f]requently attorneys and legal assistants in (Attorney Garza’s) office simply would type the declaration and take the signature of the client without reading it back to them.”
 
Attorney Gonzalez implies that Attorney Garza did not respond truthfully regarding her handling of the respondent’s case. Although Attorney Gonzalez’s affidavit impugns Attorney Garza’s integrity, the respondent has not offered evidence that Attorney Garza has been notified of, and given a chance to respond to, the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in the instant motion, or that a proper complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. See Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 648 (5th Cir. 2014) (counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed to respond before allegations of ineffective assistance are presented to the Board); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639 (setting forth the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board). We conclude, therefore, that equitable tolling of the filing deadline based on the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not warranted in this case. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). Further, it has not been shown that an exceptional situation is present in this case to warrant reopening sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sandy Restrepo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ryan A. Kahler
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 19, 2014. The respondent has also moved for a remand. The motion will be denied and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under a clearly erroneous standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Upon our de novo review, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion for a continuance to pursue a “U” visa as a crime victim. See section 101(a)(15)(U)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U)(i). While the Immigration Judge did not specifically reference our precedent decision in Matter of Sanchez Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807 (BIA 2012), concerning the adjudication of such motions, we find that he nonetheless gave adequate consideration to relevant factors and properly ruled on the respondent’s motion.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.6; see also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009). Relevant factors for consideration where a continuance is based upon a U visa outlined in Matter of Sanchez Sosa include whether there is government opposition to the motion, evidence of an underlying crime that may serve as a basis for a U visa, and evidence that the alien is prima facie eligible for a U visa. In this instance, the motion was opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the respondent presented no evidence to show that the relevant visa petition (Form I-918) had been filed and was being processed, or that the respondent had obtained the necessary law enforcement certification to show that he qualified for the visa (Tr. at 9). See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14. Thus, the respondent failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for a U visa. Under the circumstances, we find that the respondent did not establish good cause for a continuance and we conclude that the Immigration Judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the continuance.
 
*2 The respondent’s motion to remand appears to claim that he received ineffective assistance from prior counsel. The motion is accompanied by a copy of a U visa petition, an unsigned law enforcement certification in support of the visa petition, and an affidavit in support the visa petition detailing an immigration fraud allegedly committed against the respondent. The motion is defective as a claim of ineffective assistance because the respondent has failed to substantially comply with the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective representation outlined in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (I.J. at 4). Given the vague nature of the affidavit underlying the Form I-918 concerning the alleged fraud and the equally vague descriptions of both prior and current counsel regarding the actions taken in connection with the filing of the Form I-918, we do not find that deficient representation is sufficiently plain on the record to excuse compliance with Matter of Lozada. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir.2000). Inasmuch as the respondent has not shown that he prima facie eligible for a U visa, we also find that he has failed to demonstrate the prejudice required to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance because he did not establish that he is prima facie eligible for the relief sought. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (an alien asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate prejudice); see also Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793-94 (9th Cir. 2005) (stating that an alien must demonstrate that prior counsel’s performance may have affected the outcome of the proceedings).
 
Effective January 20, 2009, an Immigration Judge who grants an alien voluntary departure must advise the alien that proof of posting of a bond with the DHS must be submitted to the Board within 30 days of filing an appeal, and that the Board will not reinstate a period of voluntary departure in its final order unless the alien has timely submitted sufficient proof that the required bond has been posted. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3). See Matter of Gamero, 25 I&N Dec. 164 (BIA 2010). The Immigration Judge provided the respondent with the required advisals and granted the respondent a 60-day voluntary departure period, conditioned upon the posting of a $500 bond. The record before the Board, however, does not reflect that the respondent submitted timely proof of having paid the bond. Therefore, the voluntary departure period will not be reinstated, and the respondent will be ordered removed from the United States to Mexico pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s alternate order.
 
*3 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew C. Hagen, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michele Henriques
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated March 13, 2014, finding him removable from the United States, as charged, and denying his motion to suppress evidence.1 See Motion to Suppress (December 2, 2013). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge for the reasons stated therein. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The sole issue on appeal is the respondent’s request that we reopen these proceedings based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
A motion to reopen may be denied if the respondent: (1) fails to establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought; (2) fails to introduce previously unavailable, material evidence; or (3) is found not to be entitled to a discretionary grant of the relief sought even if the first two requirements are met. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992). With respect to the second ground, the regulations state that a “motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).
 
A motion to remand must conform to the same standards as a motion to reopen where the respondent seeks to present new evidence, but will only be granted if the new evidence “would likely change the result in the case.” See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). Here, the respondent seeks a remand based on a claim that prior counsel was ineffective for various reasons. See Respondent’s Brief at 8-11.
 
The respondent has not fulfilled the prerequisites for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Debeatham v. Holder, 602 F.3d 481 484-85 (2d Cir. 2010). On appeal, the respondent makes general allegations concerning what actions former counsel should have taken, but in lieu of setting forth the agreement with former counsel concerning what action would be taken and what counsel represented to the respondent, the respondent provides a statement in which he identifies several issues he claims that prior counsel did not appropriately address (Respondent’s Brief at Exhibit B). Debeatham v. Holder, supra, at 484-85. The record does not contain proof that former counsel has been notified of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond. Respondent’s current counsel indicates he sent prior counsel a letter and a copy of the respondent’s brief on appeal. The record does not contain proof that a complaint has been filed with the disciplinary authority, and we are not persuaded by the respondent’s statement claiming that he did not file a grievance with the New York State Bar Association because he was unaware of that option.
 
*2 However, even if the respondent had complied with the Lozada requirements, he has not shown prejudice resulting from counsel’s alleged deficiencies. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638. The respondent has not identified any relief for which he may be eligible, or submitted the appropriate application for relief and supporting documents, pursuant to 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eric G. Bjotvedt, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
 
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s July 9, 2015, denial of voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for pre-conclusion voluntary departure based on a finding that the respondent did not warrant relief in the exercise of discretion (I.J. at 4-5). Specifically, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s Arizona criminal conviction for Solicitation to Commit Child Abuse with Sexual Motivation was not outweighed by his positive equities (I.J. at 4; Exh. 2). The respondent argues on appeal that a remand is warranted in this matter, because: (1) the Immigration Judge erred in considering the incorrect voluntary departure standard; and (2) he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel in that he was prevented from testifying at his hearing (Resp. Br. at 4). We disagree that a remand is warranted in this case as the respondent has not established that either of the alleged errors have caused him prejudice. See Vargas-Hernandez, 497 F.3d at 919, 926 (9th Cir. 2007); Lopez-Umanzor v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 1049, 1059 (9th Cir. 2005); Colmenar v. INS, 210 F.3d 967, 971-72 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
First, we acknowledge that the Immigration Judge laid out the legal standard for post-conclusion voluntary departure at the outset of her order, when, in fact, the respondent seeks pre-conclusion voluntary departure (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 15-16). However, later in the decision the Immigration Judge properly acknowledged the appropriate form of relief sought (I.J. at 4). Further, the Immigration Judge based her denial on a finding that the respondent did not warrant relief as a matter of discretion, a determination that is dispositive of both forms of relief Compare sections 240B(a) and 240B(b) of the Act; see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(b), (c). We find no merit in the respondent’s appellate argument that the discretionary standard is higher for post-conclusion voluntary departure, and find no indication that the Immigration Judge employed an inappropriate discretionary standard against the respondent (Resp. Br. at 5; I.J. at 4-5). Though our case law recognizes that post-conclusion voluntary departure contains a more stringent eligibility requirement in that there are certain bars to relief, there is no differentiation in our case law between the discretionary standards employed in pre and post-conclusion voluntary departure. See e.g. See Matter of Arguelles-Campos, 22 I&N Dec. 811, 817 (BIA 1999). Based on our de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the severity and recentness of the respondent’s criminal conviction in this matter outweighs his positive equities, including his remorse over his actions, his family ties in the United States, and the isolated nature of the conviction (I.J. at 4-5). See Matter of Gamboa, 14 I&N Dec. 244 (BIA 1972); see also Matter of Arguelles, 22 I&N Dec. 811, 817 (BIA 1999).
 
*2 Additionally, we disagree with the respondent that a remand is warranted based on ineffective assistance of counsel (Resp. Br. at 7-9). Regardless of whether the respondent’s counsel acted ineffectively, the respondent has not established the necessary prejudice to warrant remand. See e.g. Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793 (9th Cir. 2005) (“To prevail [on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim], the petitioner must demonstrate first that counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence, and, second, that she was prejudiced by counsel’s performance.”). We disagree with the respondent that the addition of his testimony regarding the circumstances surrounding his arrest and conviction could alter the outcome in these proceedings (Resp. Br. at 8). Nothing the respondent claims he would testify to could alter the fact that the respondent plead guilty to, and was convicted of this offense. We also disagree that any of the additional evidence of hardship to the respondent’s family, submitted for the first time on appeal, would have altered the outcome here (Resp. Br. at 8; Resp. Exh. B). As discussed above, based on our de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge the severity and recentness of this conviction are not outweighed by the respondent’s positive equities. See Matter of Gamboa, 14 I&N Dec. at 244; see also Matter of Arguelles, 22 I&N Dec. at 817.
 
Accordingly, there is no need to remand this matter, as neither the iteration of the pre-conclusion voluntary departure standard by the Immigration Judge, nor the respondent’s testimony regarding the circumstances surrounding his conviction, or the evidence submitted with this appeal, would alter the outcome of these proceedings. See Vargas-Hernandez, supra, at 926; Colmenar v. INS, supra, at 971-72. The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Iris Guerra Bravo
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent is a female native and citizen of Guatemala. On December 16, 2005, an in absentia order of removal was entered against her pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The respondent filed a motion to reopen on August 5, 2014. On August 22, 2014, an Immigration Judge denied the motion. The respondent now appeals from that decision. The respondent is not challenging that she received proper notice of her scheduled hearing on December 16, 2005. Rather, she contends that an unnamed notario gave her bad advice not to attend her hearing and that her motion is thus subject to equitable tolling. We disagree. The Immigration Judge properly found that the respondent has not shown that she received ineffective assistance of counsel, Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), to excuse her failure to appear at her hearing. Contrary to her claims, the record also reflects that when the Notice to Appear (NTA) was personally served on her, the respondent was advised in her native language, Spanish, of the consequences for failing to appear. See also Exhibit 2, Form I-213, at 3 (respondent indicated that she understood her obligation to report for her hearing). Lastly, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not shown that she is prima facie eligible for relief, such as withholding of removal or voluntary departure, to warrant reopening (I.J. at 2; Motion at 4).1 The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Justin R. Burton, Esquire
*1 This case was last before us on May 8, 2015, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s September 17, 2013, decision to deny his request for a continuance and his application for cancellation of removal. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings on August 7, 2015. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from his prior counsel, who, he argues, failed to properly prepare him and failed to file sufficient evidence in support of his requests for a continuance and for relief from removal. This evidence includes various affidavits from family, as well as tax documents and his wife’s medical records.1 He argues that if his attorney had introduced such documents at the hearing, the Immigration Judge would not have found that he did not warrant relief as a matter of discretion (I.J. at 3-5). In support of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent has submitted, inter alia, various affidavits, a photocopied complaint to the Supreme Court of Illinois, a letter to his prior counsel informing her of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and her response to the respondent’s allegations.
 
Notwithstanding this evidence, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has held that an alien cannot prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim if the ultimate relief he is seeking, such as a continuance or cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act, is discretionary in nature. See Dave v. Ashcroft, 3363 F.3d 649 (7th Cir. 2004). Moreover, since we do not find any prejudice as a result of his prior attorney’s actions or inactions, we would not otherwise remand the record on our own accord (Bd. Dec. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
While the respondent now proffers various affidavits and tax returns, we do not find that such evidence materially affects the Immigration Judge’s decision. As an initial matter, the respondent argues that his prior attorney misunderstood the filing instructions given by the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 9). While the respondent’s observations may be valid, he does not dispute that he was granted a further opportunity to support his applications for relief (Tr. at 18-23). As such, the respondent suffered no prejudice as a result of this misunderstanding. During the continued proceedings, the Immigration Judge considered testimony by the respondent’s son (Tr. at 53-57) and further accepted and read a letter from the respondent’s daughter (Tr. at 46, 55).2 While the respondent now submits affidavits from his family, we do not find that these affidavits materially alter the Immigration Judge’s findings regarding the respondent’s equities.3 The Immigration Judge weighed the family hardship which would result upon the respondent’s removal, but found that his criminal record outweighed this hardship (I.J. at 4-6; Bd. Dec. at 2). Notwithstanding the respondent’s proffered evidence, we continue to find that our overriding obligation is to safeguard the interests of the United States, and not just those of the respondent and those close to him (Bd. Dec. at 2).
 
*2 As such, we do not find that the respondent has presented a viable ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and we find no basis upon which to disturb our prior decision. The following order will, thus, be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.
 
Neil P. Miller

1

The respondent has submitted this evidence with his motion, and he has also submitted evidence regarding his own recent medical issues. He admits that his own medical issues postdate his hearing and such evidence would not have been available to his attorney in 2013.

2

While the respondent argues that prior counsel erred in not introducing this letter, the record indicates that the Immigration Judge accepted the letter and read it, but for unknown reasons the letter was not introduced into evidence.

3

In so finding, we note that the respondent’s relationship with his family appears to have evolved. The respondent’s prior counsel cannot be held accountable for the relationship the respondent maintained with his family in 2013.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pamela Hartman, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 On August 18, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted the government’s motion to remand the proceedings to the Board for further evaluation of whether the respondent’s prior counsel deficiently represented him at his hearing. The government sought a remand for consideration of the respondent’s eligibility for the domestic violence waiver under sections 240A(b)(5) and 237(a)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(b)(5) and 1227(a)(7) of the Act, given his Cal. Penal Code § 273.5(a) domestic violence conviction, and the impact of that potential eligibility on the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
 
The record is insufficiently developed for the Board to evaluate the respondent’s eligibility for the domestic violence waiver. Nor does the record contain a response from prior counsel to the respondent’s bar complaint, indicating whether prior counsel considered pursuing special rule cancellation of removal for battered spouses, and if not, why not. Under the circumstances, we will remand the proceedings to the Immigration Judge to evaluate the respondent’s eligibility for the waiver in the first instance, and if appropriate, to allow the respondent to apply for special rule cancellation of removal for battered spouses. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with this decision and with the order of the Ninth Circuit.

Ruben Salazar, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
 
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 27, 2015. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable based on his criminal convictions and ordered him removed. The respondent challenges removability on appeal, asserting there was insufficient evidence of alienage and his conviction. The respondent also challenges denial of a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Notice to Appear alleges that the respondent is not a citizen or national of the United States. It also alleges that the respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. The respondent admitted these factual allegations (Tr. at 12). Based on this evidence, the Immigration Judge found the allegations proved (I.J. at 2). We do not find this factual finding to be clearly erroneous.
 
The Notice to Appear also alleges that, on March 28, 2014, the respondent was convicted of Possession for Sale of a Controlled Substance (Methamphetamine), in violation of California Health and Safety Code section 11378 (Exh. 1). A record of this conviction was entered into the record of proceedings (Exh. 2). See section 240(c)(3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41(a). Cf. United States v. Snellenberger, 548 F.3d 699, 701-02 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc) (minute order sufficient). In addition, the respondent admitted the conviction (Tr. at 13). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.41(d), 1240.10(c). Cf. Pagayon v. Holder, 675 F.3d 1182, 1189-1190 (9th Cir. 2011); Barragan-Lopez v. Mukasey, 508 F.3d 899, 905 (9th Cir. 2007). Based on this evidence, the Immigration Judge found the conviction proved (I.J. at 2-3). We do not find this factual finding to be clearly erroneous.
 
*2 The Immigration Judge found the statute to be divisible, applied the modified categorical approach, and, after reviewing the conviction record, found the respondent removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony involving illicit trafficking in a controlled substance.1 The respondent argues that his conviction for Possession for Sale of a Controlled Substance (Methamphetamine), in violation of California Health and Safety Code section 11378, does not constitute an aggravated felony involving illicit trafficking in a controlled substance because the California law criminalizes drugs not criminalized under federal law and one of the submitted documents does not identify the drug.
 
We agree that the statute of conviction is divisible and the substance involved in his conviction must be established before the charge of removability can be sustained. See Padilla-Martinez v. Holder, 770 F.3d 825, 832 n.3 (9th Cir. 2014). See also U.S. v. Torre-Jimenez, 771 F.3d 1163, 1165-67 (9th Cir. 2014); Coronado v. Holder, 747 F.3d 662, 668-69 (9th Cir. 2014); U.S. v. Valdavinos-Torres, 704 F.3d 679, 689 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding that the modified categorical approach could be used as part of elements-based inquiry to ascertain portion of California prohibited substances statute to which alien had actually pleaded guilty to violating). Under the modified categorical approach, courts conduct a limited examination of documents in the record of conviction to determine if there is sufficient evidence to conclude that a defendant was convicted of the elements of the generically defined crime even though the statute of conviction is facially over inclusive. See Shepard v. U.S., 544 U.S. 13 (2005).2
 
We find that the judicially-noticeable documents submitted in this case sufficiently establish that the controlled substance involved was methamphetamine, and support the charge of removability. Count 1 of the complaint for case number RIF1314876 states that the respondent “did willfully and unlawfully possess for sale a controlled substance, to wit, methamphetamine” (Exh. 2 at 2). The plea form indicates that the respondent pled guilty to a violation of California Health and Safety Code section 11378, as reflected in count 1 of the complaint. It says: “I will enter a guilty plea to the following charges and enhancements: Ct 1: HS 11378...” (Exh. 2 at 4). In addition, the court’s sentencing memorandum refers to “charges admitted: I 11378 HS” (Exh. 2 at 5). There is no dispute that methamphetamine is a controlled substance under the federal law. See 21 U.S.C. § 812(c), sch. II(c), III(a)(3).
 
*3 Within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a state drug crime qualifies as an aggravated felony if it contains a “trafficking element.” See e.g., Daas v. Holder, 620 F.3d 1050, 1054 (9th Cir. 2010). A state offense has a “trafficking element” if it involves the possession of a federally-controlled substance with intent to sell it for a price. See Rendon v. Mukasey, 520 F.3d 967, 976 (9th Cir. 2008). In order to convict a defendant of possessing a controlled substance for sale, a California prosecutor is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the specific intent to sell a controlled substance for some form of remuneration. See People v. Harris, 99 Cal. Rptr.2d 618 (Cal.App. 2d Dist. 2000); People v. Parra, 82 Cal. Rptr. 2d 541, 543-44 (Cal. Ct. App. 1999). The terms “sale” and “sell” are not statutorily defined in California, but state courts have interpreted them in a manner consistent with their common meaning, i.e.,”DD’ to transfer to another for a price.”DD’ People v. Daniels, 537 P.2d 1232, 1235 (Cal. 1975). Therefore, in California a “sale” of drugs denotes an exchange of drugs for cash, goods, services, favors, or some other non-cash benefit. People v. Daniels, supra, at 1235; People v. Peck, 61 Cal. Rptr. 2d 1, 3 (Cal. Ct. App. 1996); People v. Lazenby, 8 Cal. Rptr. 2d 541, 542-43 (Cal. Ct. App. 1992). A non-remunerative transfer of drugs, such as casual sharing, does not qualify as a “sale” under California law.
 
By its terms, California Health and Safety Code section 11378 prohibits the possession for sale of various narcotic controlled substances. Because a conviction under section 11378 requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed a controlled substance with the specific intent to sell it (or have it sold) for a price, we conclude that section 11378 has a “““trafficking element.” See Rendon v. Mukasey, 520 F.3d at 975-76.
 
Consequently, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s findings that the respondent has been convicted of an aggravated felony involving illicit trafficking in a controlled substance and that removability has been proved by clear and convincing evidence. See section 240(c)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(a); Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276, 286 (1966). Cf. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.15, 1240.10.
 
*4 On appeal, the respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion in denying a continuance (I.J. at 3-4). The respondent had asked the Immigration Judge for a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief. The respondent argues on appeal that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of this conviction.3 An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).
 
We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We conclude that good cause was not shown. We note that, in the plea form, the respondent was warned: “If I am not a citizen of the United States, I understand that this conviction may have the consequences of deportation, exclusion from admission to the United States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of the United States” (Exh. 2 at 3). In addition, we note that the respondent does not say that a post-conviction motion has been filed and granted.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The term “aggravated felony” includes illicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18, United States Code). See section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B). The term “drug trafficking crime” means any state felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2). See Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S. 47 (2006).

The record of conviction includes the charging document (indictment, complaint, or information), jury instructions, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, judgment of conviction, jury verdict, a comparable judicial record, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented (e.g., in police report or in pre-sentence investigation report). See Shepard v. U.S., 544 U.S. at 16, 26.

In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel. See also Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. ___, 133 S.Ct. 1103 (2013) (holding that Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, which requires defense counsel to advise a defendant about the risk of deportation arising from a guilty plea, does not apply retroactively).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Johanna Cochran, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Diane Dodd
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals a May 21, 2015, decision by the Immigration Judge denying reopening of an April 2, 2015, decision, which ordered the respondent removed to Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security has filed a brief in opposition to the appeal. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge, under a clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen was a 21-page document alleging ineffective assistance of counsel against the attorney who represented him in his removal proceedings. He made specific arguments against said attorney, i.e., that his attorney erroneously told him that he did not have any other options other to accept his order of removal (Motion at 13-14). He also contends that his attorney did not inform him or his father that he had filed a stay of removal (Motion at 9). Furthermore, he contends that he is eligible for relief from removal (Motion at 15-20). He complied with the procedural requirements delineated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (Motion at 9-10).
 
The Immigration Judge did not discuss the respondent’s specific arguments in his motion, only issuing a one-page handwritten order, stating that the respondent twice confirmed that he agreed to the order of removal, waived appeal, and was satisfied with the representation he received from his counsel. The Immigration Judge’s conclusion does not sufficiently address the issues raised by the respondent’s motion. See Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994) (when a motion to reopen deportation proceedings is denied, the Immigration Judge must identify and fully explain the reasons for the decision; otherwise, the parties are deprived of a fair opportunity to contest the decision on appeal, and the Board is unable to exercise meaningfully its responsibility of reviewing the decision in light of the arguments advanced on appeal); see also Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999) (holding that because the Board’s fact-finding ability is limited, it is essential for Immigration Judges to include in their decisions clear and complete findings of fact that are supported by the record and are in compliance with controlling law). The respondent has argued that his agreement to removal and waiver of appeal were based on erroneous advice rather than a tactical decision.
 
*2 Accordingly, we find it necessary to remand the record for the entry of a new decision that more fully addresses, in light of the evidence in the record, the respondent’s arguments and the reasons for rejecting them.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the aforementioned decision.

File: AXXX XX6 459 - Memphis, TN
October 28, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Divyesh Gopal, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has filed a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 10, 2014, denying his request for a continuance and granting voluntary departure with an alternative order of removal from the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a brief or other response. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent failed to establish good cause for a continuance in his case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 355 (BIA 1983). In particular, the Immigration Judge correctly noted that the respondent had been granted two prior continuances, one providing nearly a year to obtain counsel and a second providing nearly another year to file all applications for relief (I.J. at 1-6; Tr. at 9, 16). The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent filed a request for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion (PD) with DHS approximately 2 days before the final hearing, the request was denied by DHS, and the respondent did not have any applications for relief pending on the date of the final hearing (I.J. at 3, 6; Tr. at 20). Compare Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009) (setting forth factors to consider when adjudicating a motion for a continuance based on a pending visa petition). The Immigration Judge correctly noted that DHS opposed the continuance request (I.J. at 5-6; Tr. at 21). Id.
 
On appeal, the respondent concedes that he had sufficient time to prepare his case (Resp. Br. at 7). He also notes that the decision of whether or not to exercise prosecutorial discretion lies solely with DHS, not with the Immigration Judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals (Resp. Br. at 7).
 
The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge failed to consider whether DHS was being reasonable in opposing the continuance request, where it was based on the respondent filing his PD request just 48 hours before the final hearing and the court’s filing deadline for all applications for relief (Resp. Br. at 7-8; Tr. at 21). See Matter of Hashmi, supra, at 791. It is clear from the Immigration Judge’s decision, however, that she concluded that the DHS’ opposition to the continuance was reasonable and supported by the record, and we agree with these conclusions (I.J. at 4-6). Id. The Immigration Judge properly concluded that the respondent did not exercise due diligence in pursuing relief from removal (I.J. at 5). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate good cause for a continuance under these circumstances, and conclude that the discretionary denial of the motion for a continuance was appropriate.
 
*2 The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge failed to consider the likelihood of success of his request for prosecutorial discretion filed with DHS (Resp. Br. at 7-8). However, the correct measure is the ultimate likelihood of success on any application for adjustment to lawful status in the United States, not whether or not a respondent’s removal proceedings might be administratively closed in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See Matter of Hashmi, supra, at 790. Moreover, the respondent has not provided any specific arguments or evidence showing that he warranted a grant of prosecutorial discretion. To date, the respondent has not shown that he had any prima facie approvable application for relief from removal pending on the date of the last hearing.
 
The denial of a continuance will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing, and here the respondent has not shown such. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987). Furthermore, contrary to his claim on appeal, the respondent has failed to show prejudice (Resp. Br. at 8). See Matter of Sibrun, supra. In particular, to date the respondent has not established that he had any applications for relief pending that were prima facie approvable, including a request for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion by DHS, as discussed above. Id.
 
On the Notice of Appeal, the respondent alleges ineffective assistance by prior counsel. This allegation is not accompanied by any specific details, and is not raised as an issue in the respondent’s brief on appeal. Furthermore, this allegation is not supported by any documentary evidence in compliance with any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (establishing ineffective assistance of counsel), nor does the record support a finding of per se ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Appeal Brief; Respondent’s Notice of Appeal; I.J. at 1-6; Tr. at 1-30).
 
Finally, we are unable to reinstate voluntary departure in this case. The Immigration Judge provided the respondent with the required advisals and granted the respondent a 60-day voluntary departure period, conditioned upon the posting of a $500 bond. The record before the Board, however, does not reflect that the respondent submitted timely proof of having paid that bond. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3). See Matter of Gamero, 25 I&N Dec. 164 (BIA 2010). Therefore, the voluntary departure period will not be reinstated, and the respondent is subject to removal from the United States pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s alternate order.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent is ordered removed from the United States to Mexico, pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s alternate order.

IN RE: MARIA DE LOS ANGELES LOWE A.K.A. MARIA LOWE-ALARCON A.K.A. MARIA ALARCON-CERVANTES
File: AXXX XX7 912 - El Paso, TX
October 27, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Charles Spector, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. She has filed a timely motion to reconsider our August 7, 2015, decision denying reopening. The motion is denied.
 
The respondent contends that the Board erred in denying reopening because former counsel provided ineffective assistance. In her motion to reopen, she argued that former counsel erroneously conceded she was removable under section 237(a)(1)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(E)(i). As we previously found, former counsel did not concede removability. Further, on the facts of this case, we agreed with the Immigration Judge that the respondent was removable as charged, and therefore did not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel or prejudice.
 
On reconsideration, the respondent repeats the arguments previously raised, but has not identified any material error of fact or law in our prior decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). The respondent continues to argue that she is not removable as charged because her adjustment of status was not an admission under Martinez v. Mukasey, 519 F.3d 532 (5th Cir. 2008). The issue here was whether the respondent was removable as an alien who “prior to the date of entry, at the time of any entry, or within five years of the date of any entry” smuggled any other alien into the United States. Section 237(a)(1)(E)(i) of the Act.
 
On this record, the respondent did not smuggle other aliens prior to her entry or at the time of any entry, i.e., in 1996 or on October 26, 2007, when she adjusted her status. However, she was convicted of smuggling aliens on October 21, 2010, and this conviction was within 5 years of “any entry”, i.e., her adjustment of status. See Matter of Bouchra Agour, 26 I&N Dec. 566, 579 (BIA 2015)(adjustment of status is merely a procedural mechanism by which an alien is assimilated to the position of one seeking to enter the United States.) The words “any entry” are broad and contemplate a variety of ways to enter the United States, including adjustment of status. Since Martinez only involved the definition of admission or admitted for purposes of section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), Martinez does not apply.
 
*2 To the extent that the word “entry” in section 237(a)(1)(E)(i) may be construed as synonymous with admission,1 we nevertheless continue to find that Martinez is not binding here. The question here is removability, not eligibility for a waiver as in Martinez. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit was careful to limit the holding of Martinez to the question of a section 212(h) waiver. See e.g. Martinez v. Mukasey, supra, 519 F.3d at 542-45 (declining to apply Matter of Rosas-Ramirez, 22 I&N Dec. 616 (BIA 1999), which involved a question of removability, to section 212(h)). Since Martinez did not hold that adjustment of status was not an admission for purposes of removability, we decline to extend the Fifth Circuit’s holding to removability.2 See Matter of Chavez-Alvarez, 26 I&N Dec. 274, 275-78 (2014)(adjustment of status is an admission for purposes of determining inadmissibility or removability), rev’d on other grounds, 783 F.3d 478 (3d Cir. 2015). The respondent has not identified any material error of fact or law in our August 7, 2015, decision. Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

In our August 7, 2015, decision, we stated that “Martinez did not hold that adjustment of status was not an admission.” For purposes of clarity, that statement should state: “Martinez did not hold that adjustment of status was not an admission for purposes of removability.”

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Orlando Mondragon, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margot Johnson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)] - In the United States in violation of law (conceded)
 
Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)] - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status (conceded)
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; voluntary departure
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Kosovo, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated November 12, 2014, granting the respondent pre-conclusion voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). The appeal will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that the Immigration Judge should have continued removal proceedings to allow the respondent’s wife, a United States citizen, to pursue a Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) on his behalf and for attorney preparation (Resp. Brief at 2-4). However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argues that because the respondent accepted pre-conclusion voluntary departure, he waived his right to pursue an appeal (DHS Brief at 2-3). A condition of a proper grant of pre-conclusion voluntary departure requires the respondent to waive his right to appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D). Therefore, we must evaluate whether the respondent waived this right knowingly and voluntarily.
 
Here, the respondent does not argue that his waiver of appeal was not made knowingly and voluntarily. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320 (BIA 2000). Instead, the respondent expressly states he “is not appealing the grant of voluntary departure . . .” (Resp. Brief at 2). Notably, the respondent accepted this benefit with the assistance of counsel. The respondent, who has new counsel on appeal, has not challenged the effectiveness of his counsel below. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (outlining the requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); see also Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 2014) (requiring compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada). Absent egregious circumstances, which are not alleged in this case, the respondent is bound by the tactical decisions and actions made by his attorney when such attorney is acting in his professional capacity. Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938, 942 (BIA 1995) (citation omitted).
 
*2 Given this procedural posture, we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of the respondent’s appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39 (“[T]he decision of the Immigration Judge becomes final upon waiver of appeal . . . .”); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(a)(1) (“A Notice of Appeal may not be filed by any party who has waived appeal . . . .”); Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, supra, at 699 (“[I]nasmuch as the immigration judge’s decision is final, this Board lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the case before us.”). Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The record is returned to the Immigration Judge without further action.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mayra Joli, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Chelsea Braden
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative decision on October 8, 2014, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision ordering the respondent removed to Brazil. The respondent seeks reopening 10 months later and requests equitably tolling of the time limit based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 713 F.3d 1357 (11th Cir. 2013) (en banc). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied as untimely, as the respondent has not shown that an exception to the time limitation on motions applies. See Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
We are not persuaded of any error with prior counsel’s representation, much less prejudice. See Ali v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 643 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir. 2011) (alien must establish prejudice in order to prevail on ineffective assistance claim); Dakane v. U.S. Att’y. Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273-74 (11th Cir. 2005); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (establishing ineffective assistance of counsel requires an alien to demonstrate prejudice from counsel’s conduct, such that it compromised the fundamental fairness of the hearing). Notwithstanding the respondent’s allegations, the Immigration Judge’s marriage fraud finding was well-supported considering, inter alia, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services officer’s credible testimony, the respondent’s sworn statement admitting fraud, and her unpersuasive testimony. Nor will we second-guess counsel’s strategic decision to not challenge the Immigration Judge’s negative inference drawn from the respondent’s lack of eye contact, particularly given the specific and cogent reasons underlying the adverse credibility determination. See Matter of A-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 1106 (BIA 1998) (observing that an adverse inference based on an alien’s demeanor is generally accorded high deference, especially where such inference is supported by specific and cogent reasons undermining the alien’s veracity); Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (absent a showing of egregious circumstances, an attorney’s tactical decisions are binding on the alien). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Benjamin Peppercorn Bratter, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondents,1 natives and citizens of El Salvador, appeal the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated July 1, 2015,2 denying their motion to reopen. We will dismiss the appeal.
 
On December 4, 2014, the respondents, through counsel, submitted written pleadings admitting all of the factual allegations contained in this their Notices to Appear and conceded that they were subject to removal from the United States pursuant to section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1; Exh. 2). These proceedings were completed when, on January 6, 2015, the respondents appeared before the Immigration Judge with counsel, and indicated that they wished to take an order of removal (I.J. at 1). The respondent filed the instant motion to reopen on June 11, 2015.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (“A motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal, deportation, or exclusion, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later.”). We acknowledge the respondent’s claim that her former attorney provided with ineffective assistance of counsel (Motion to Reopen). However, she has not established that she was prejudiced by her former attorney’s handling of this matter. In particular, we note that while the respondent indicates that she wishes to file an Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal (Form I-589), she has not demonstrated her prima facie eligibility for such relief. The respondent, who fears gangs in El Salvador, has not demonstrated a nexus between her fear of harm, and a protected ground enumerated in section 101(a)(42)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992) (explaining that the Board may deny a motion to remand or motion to reopen where a prima facie case for the relief sought has not been established); see Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 235 (BIA 2014) (“asylum and refugee laws do not protect people from general conditions of strife, such as crime and other societal afflictions”).
 
The respondent’s motion also did not establish that changed country conditions in El Salvador should permit her to file an otherwise untimely motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(4)(i). The respondent does not allege sufficient facts to establish a change in conditions in El Salvador which arose subsequent to her ultimate removal hearing on January 6, 2015. See Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247, 257 (BIA 2007).
 
*2 Finally, the respondent has not established that an exceptional situation exists which would warrant sua sponte reopening. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
For the reasons set forth above, we decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marcia Kasdan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Delia Irene Gonzalez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of July 28, 2014. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia on November 29, 2011. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
The Notice of Hearing (NOH) for the November 29, 2011, hearing was mailed to the respondent’s counsel, Norma Sepulveda, Esquire, on February 23, 2011 (I.J. at 1).1 The respondent failed to appear at her hearing and an in absentia order was entered on November 29, 2011. The respondent filed a motion to reopen in absentia proceedings on July 8, 2014, alleging that she did not receive notice of her hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that Ms. Sepulveda’s representation was limited to bond proceedings. However, the record does not support this assertion. As noted by the Immigration Judge, Ms. Sepulveda filed a motion to withdraw on October 17, 2011, with evidence showing that the respondent was notified of her November 29, 2011, hearing (I.J. at 2). The fact that Ms. Sepulveda had withdrawn representation because the respondent intended to seek new counsel elsewhere does not excuse the respondent’s appearance at her November 29, 2011, hearing.
 
The respondent has not alleged or shown ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006); Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605, 609 fn.15 (5th Cir. 2006) (alien’s right to due process is violated when the representation afforded him was so deficient as to impinge upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing, and, as a result, the alien suffered substantial prejudice); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). To show prejudice, an alien must make a prima facie showing that, but for counsel’s error, she would have been entitled to the relief she sought. See Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994). Here, while the respondent contends that she would seek asylum, she has not specified the basis for her claim, nor has she provided the requisite application (Form I-589). The respondent has not demonstrated that she is prima facie eligible for any relief, and thus she has failed to establish she suffered any prejudice, even had there been ineffective representation. See, e.g., Ogunfuye v. Holder, 610 F.3d 303, 306-07 (5th Cir. 2010) (explaining that to prevail on a due process claim, an individual must demonstrate with substantial evidence that the error could have changed the outcome of proceedings).
 
*2 The respondent’s appellate contention that venue should have been automatically changed once the respondent was released from detention is unavailing. There was no basis for the Immigration Judge to do so in the absence of any request for a change of venue filed by the respondent.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Petra D. Fist, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brian G. McDonnell
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s July 15, 2015, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings that were conducted in absentia on March 10, 2014. The respondent also requests a remand. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and his motion denied.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent did not demonstrate that the in absentia order of removal qualifies for rescission. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). Nor do we find clear error in the factual findings supporting that determination. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an order issued following proceedings conducted in absentia may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed (a) within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that he failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, or (b) at any time if the alien demonstrates he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely as it was filed well after 180 days, more than 1 year, after the date of the order of removal and, in any event, establishes no exceptional circumstances that would excuse the respondent’s failure to appear. Contrary to the respondent’s apparent assertion, whether exceptional circumstances existed one year earlier does not assist the respondent in demonstrating that his untimely motion qualifies for rescission. However, to the extent the respondent claims lack of proper notice, his motion is timely.
 
Yet, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the respondent received proper notice of his March 10, 2014, scheduled hearing. As the Immigration Judge noted, the record reflects that the respondent was present with former counsel in court when the hearing date was furnished both orally and in writing (I.J. at 3; Exh. 3). The record does not reflect that either the respondent or former counsel ever indicated that they did not understand that the respondent’s next hearing was scheduled for March 10, 2014.
 
Likewise, the “new” affidavits proffered along with the respondent’s motion to remand neither specifically assert nor sufficiently reflect either that the respondent or former counsel did not receive proper notice or understand that the respondent’s next hearing was scheduled for March 10, 2014. Nor does such evidence sufficiently reflect that respondent’s former counsel failed to notify the respondent of his scheduled hearing.
 
*2 Moreover, while a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel can in some circumstances toll the filing requirements applicable to motions to reopen, an alien seeking such tolling must show that he or she exercised due diligence in discovering and seeking to remedy the ineffective assistance. See Mahmood v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 248, 252 (3d Cir. 2005). The respondent does not contend that former counsel is responsible for his delay in filing his motion before the Immigration Judge. Indeed, the respondent does not dispute that he was, at the very least, aware that he had missed his scheduled hearing due to the alleged deficient performance of former counsel. Under the circumstances, the alleged “fixing the problem” response to the respondent’s continued inquiries about the status of his case alone is not a reasonable explanation for waiting more than a year to contact current counsel and move for reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel. On this record, we concur with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent has sufficiently shown due diligence in pursing reopening of his case. See Mahmood v. Gonzales, supra, at 252-53 (finding that a 13-month delay in moving to reopen was conclusive so as to deny equitable tolling, despite an alien’s difficulty in “navigating the shoals of American law”).
 
On the whole, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s resolution of the respondent’s claim. The respondent on appeal raises no other claims to relief. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed and his motion to remand is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Benjamin T. Wiesinger, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the United Kingdom, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 30, 2015. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and denied the respondent’s request for another continuance. On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of the continuance.1 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent alleges that she was not advised of the immigration consequences of the plea that resulted in the conviction that renders her removable and ineligible for relief from removal, so she filed a motion to vacate it.2 The motion before the criminal court was denied for untimeliness, and she filed a motion to reconsider the denial of the motion on November 7, 2014. That motion remained pending on June 30, 2015. The Immigration Judge granted the respondent continuances to pursue post-conviction relief from September 11, 2014, to June 22, 2015 (I.J. at 2-3).
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s denial of an additional continuance. She also says the motion to reconsider was denied on August 15, 2015, and says she has appealed the denial of the motion to the Arizona Court of Appeals.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009). We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We conclude that good cause was not shown. While the respondent is free to pursue the appeal of the denial of the post-conviction motion, such an appeal does not justify a stay of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In the Notice of Appeal, the respondent generically asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that she was convicted of an aggravated felony, but she does not address that issue in her brief, so we find that issue abandoned.

In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel. See also Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. _____, 133 S.Ct. 1103 (2013) (holding that Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, which requires defense counsel to advise a defendant about the risk of deportation arising from a guilty plea, does not apply retroactively).

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of India, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of August 5, 2014. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on November 28, 2011. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
The Notice of Hearing (NOH) for the November 28, 2011, hearing was mailed to the respondent’s counsel, Burhan Nomani, on April 8, 2011 (I.J. at 1).1 The respondent failed to appear at his hearing and an in absentia order was entered on November 28, 2011. The respondent filed a motion to reopen in absentia proceedings on July 8, 2014, alleging that he did not receive notice of his hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding that notice to counsel constitutes notice to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that Burhan Nomani’s representation was limited to bond proceedings. However, the record does not support this assertion. As noted by the Immigration Judge, Burhan Nomani filed a motion to withdraw on October 19, 2011, stating that the respondent is aware of his November 28, 2011, hearing, but had not maintained contact with counsel (I.J. at 2). The respondent has not alleged or shown ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006); Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605, 609 fn.15 (5th Cir. 2006) (alien’s right to due process is violated when the representation afforded him was so deficient as to impinge upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing, and, as a result, the alien suffered substantial prejudice); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Murray D. Hilts, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 30, 2015, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent became a lawful permanent resident on April 22, 1996. On November 15, 2004, the respondent was convicted of: 1) transportation of a controlled substance in violation of section 11379(a) of the California Health and Safety Code, and 2) disobeying a court order to prevent domestic violence in violation of section 273.6(a) of the California Penal Code. Due to these convictions, on August 18, 2005, the respondent was issued a Notice to Appear charging him with removability for an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B), and for violating an order of protection under section 237(a)(2)(E)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(ii). The respondent, through prior counsel, conceded removability and was ordered removed by an Immigration Judge on September 21, 2005. The respondent waived appeal.
 
On February 12, 2015, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, arguing that ineffective assistance of prior counsel prevented him from pursuing an application for cancellation of removal for lawful permanent residents during removal proceedings in 2005. Specifically, the respondent asserts that at the time of his removal proceedings, his conviction for transportation of a controlled substance was not an aggravated felony under controlling precedent; therefore, he would have been eligible to apply for cancellation of removal. On April 30, 2015, the Immigration Judge denied reopening, and the respondent now appeals.
 
In denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent was subject to the post-departure limitations on motions to reopen in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (I.J. at 1). Subsequent to the decision of the Immigration Judge, a precedent decision regarding the applicability of the departure bar to an alien’s statutory right to file a motion to reopen was issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In Toor v. Lynch, 789 F.3d 1055 (9th Cir. 2015) the court held that the text of Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (“IIRIRA”) makes clear that the an alien has a statutory right to file a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider removal proceedings and this right is not limited by whether an alien has departed the United States. Therefore, the respondent’s removal from the United States did not preclude his ability to seek reopening within the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit.1
 
*2 The respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was not filed within 90 days of the final administrative decision in his case, which was the Immigration Judge’s September 21, 2005, decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1). The motion, in which the respondent seeks that his proceedings be reopened to allow him to apply for cancellation of removal for lawful permanent residents, does not fall within any statutory or regulatory exception to motion time or number limitations. Section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3), 1003.23(b)(4).
 
In his motion to reopen and on appeal, the respondent claims that prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance. While we recognize that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen for the reasons that follow.
 
The respondent was not entitled to equitable tolling to toll the approximately 10 year delay in filing his motion to reopen because the respondent failed to show that he acted with “due” or “reasonable” diligence in discovering any “deception, fraud, or error” that prevented him from timely filing his motion. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2011); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). On appeal, the respondent asserts solely that after he was removed to Mexico, he was unaware of the deficient performance of prior counsel, and that he only became aware of it after he unlawfully re-entered without inspection sometime after September 21, 2005, and contacted an attorney in August 2014. That the respondent waited until August 2014 to seek advice is not a showing of due or reasonable diligence, particularly given that he has not shown or otherwise alleged that he was prevented from asking a relative or friend to contact an attorney, or doing so himself, sooner than 2014. Nor has he shown that any ignorance of the law was caused by circumstances beyond his control. See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001) (in order for equitable tolling to apply, the respondent needs to show that his ignorance was caused by circumstances beyond his control, and which go beyond a claim of excusable neglect). Accordingly, as the respondent has not shown that he warrants equitable tolling, the Immigration Judge appropriately denied his motion to reopen.
 
*3 Moreover, the respondent has not shown that his prior counsel’s allegedly deficient performance caused him prejudice, as the record does not demonstrate that prior counsel misapplied the law at the time of the respondent’s removal hearing. See Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893, 898 (9th Cir. 2008) (prejudice is established when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings). The respondent argues that he would have been eligible for cancellation of removal as his conviction was not an aggravated felony under controlling precedent. However, at the time of the respondent’s removal proceedings, there was no precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit or the Board that indicated that the respondent would have been eligible for relief. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated the requisite prejudice to support his claim, as he has not demonstrated that any alleged deficiencies of his former counsel affected the outcome of proceedings (I.J. at 2). See Iturribarria v. INS, supra, at 901-02.
 
Finally, we agree with the Immigration Judge that sua sponte reopening is not warranted (I.J. at 2). While we acknowledge that a fundamental change in law may be considered an exceptional situation warranting sua sponte reopening, we conclude that the respondent did not act diligently even after this change in law. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1134-36 (BIA 1999); Matter of G-C-L-, 23 I&N Dec. 359, 361 (BIA 2002) (explaining that because more than 5 years had passed since the enactment of new law, the interest of finality in immigration proceedings took precedence over sua sponte reopening an untimely motion to reopen to seek relief based upon that change in law). Further, considering the totality of the circumstances presented and alleged, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances sufficient to justify exercising his discretionary authority to reopen the respondent’s removal proceedings sua sponte (I.J. at 2). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The Immigration Judge also held that the respondent was precluded from filing a motion to reopen under section 241(a)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5) (I.J. at 1-2). We agree that were the respondent subject to the reinstatement of his prior removal order under section 241(a)(5) of the Act, the Immigration Judge would be without authority to reopen the respondent’s prior removal proceedings. See section 241(a)(5) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 241.8 (procedures for reinstating prior removal order). However, there is no evidence in the record that the Department of Homeland Security has issued the respondent a notice that his prior removal order will be reinstated or has otherwise sought to reinstate his removal order. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.8.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anish Vashistha, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael D. Steinberg
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The present motion to reopen, which is the respondent’s second request for reopening, is both untimely filed by many years and number barred and is denied on that basis. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The motion has not been shown to qualify for any exception to the time and numerical limitations imposed by law on motions to reopen removal proceedings.
 
Moreover, we decline to equitably toll the applicable filing requirements based on the respondent’s alleged ineffective assistance of former counsels claim. The respondent does not assert, nor does the submitted evidence reflect, that she was prevented from timely filing the present motion by “deception, fraud, or error.” See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2011); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
Moreover, we do not find that there has not been any showing of due diligence in pursuing the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra. The doctrine of equitable tolling applies when “““despite all due diligence, [the party invoking equitable tolling] is unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of the claim.” Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001). The respondent does not dispute that she was, at the very least, dissatisfied with the performance of her former attorneys at the time services were rendered by each. Nor does she dispute that she was aware of both the Board’s June 22, 2007, decision dismissing her appeal, and October 16, 2007, decision denying her first motion to reopen. Other than hiring current counsel, for which the respondent provides no dates or details, the respondent has offered no reasonable explanation for waiting almost 8 years from the Board’s last decision in this case to file the present motion. Under the circumstances, we do not find that the respondent has sufficiently demonstrated that she exercised due diligence in pursuing her ineffective assistance claim against former counsels.
 
Further, the respondent has not demonstrated sufficient compliance with the procedural requirements for advancing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 53 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). The submitted bar complaint packages noting that a copy of each package was sent to the corresponding counsel alone is insufficient to satisfy the requirement that former counsels be notified of the allegations against them and given an opportunity to respond. See Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 On this record, the respondent has not provided an adequate basis to excuse the fact that the present motion is both untimely and number barred. Nor has she identified an exceptional situation that would warrant reopening of these proceedings under the Board’s discretionary sua sponte authority. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lee Knox, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Aminda B. Katz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; withdraw pleadings
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s November 6, 2014, decision denying both his request for a continuance and his motion to withdraw pleadings. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent’s contention that he should have been able to withdraw pleadings is without merit. See generally Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986) (finding that a respondent is bound by the tactical decisions made by his counsel). As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent did not specifically assert or describe any egregious circumstances surrounding his pleadings. While the respondent proffered a 1-page personal affidavit in support of his Motion to Withdraw Pleadings, he does not raise any argument on appeal that persuades this Board that the affidavit established a prima facie case that egregious violations of the Fourth Amendment or other liberties that might transgress notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the probative value of the evidence obtained occurred. See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1050-51 (1984). Moreover, the respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel; nor has he complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
We also find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision declining to grant the respondent’s request for a continuance. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). As the Immigration Judge noted, since initiated in September 2012, the respondent’s removal proceedings have been continued on multiple occasions. Further, as the Immigration Judge noted, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) indicated that it declines to exercise prosecutorial discretion in this case.
 
Additionally, as an alien who has not been admitted to the United States, the respondent is statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). In addition, the respondent did not submit an application for adjustment to the Immigration Judge and has submitted no evidence on appeal reflecting that he has an application for adjustment pending before the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), or that he is eligible for any other form of relief from removal. Thus, a continuance to afford the respondent an opportunity to pursue adjustment of status or any other form of relief is and was not warranted.
 
*2 Finally, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent a 60-day voluntary departure period, conditioned upon the posting of a voluntary departure bond in the amount of $500.00 to the Department of Homeland Security within five business days from the date of the order. The record reflects that the respondent submitted timely proof of having paid the voluntary departure bond. Accordingly, the period of voluntary departure will be reinstated.
 
In sum, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s resolution of the respondent’s claim. The respondent on appeal raises no other claims to relief. Accordingly, we will enter the following orders.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(f).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thomas S. Rome, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Leigh Mapplebeck
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Peru, who is subject to an order of removal entered on February 19, 2015, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated June 11, 2015, denying his late-filed motion to reopen. The respondent has also filed a motion for stay of removal. The respondent’s appeal fee waiver request is granted. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed, and the motion will be denied as moot.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. We have considered the totality of the respondent’s claims on appeal, including his claim that he wishes to challenge his removability and to be granted time to pursue collateral relief for a criminal conviction, and conclude that no basis was established for granting the motion.
 
As pointed out by the Immigration Judge, the respondent’s motion is untimely (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Nonetheless, the motion may be considered a motion for sua sponte reopening. Sua sponte authority is an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
A main basis on which reopening was sought is alleged ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of the respondent’s previous attorney. However, the general procedural requirements for presenting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim have not been complied with, and no argument has been made that the procedural requirements should be waived. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec.637 (BIA 1988) aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Furthermore, the respondent does not challenge on appeal the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen insofar as that denial rejected an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. I.J. at 1 (June 11, 2015). Therefore, we need not address the issue further.
 
The Immigration Judge issued an oral decision on February 19, 2015. No appeal was taken from that decision, and the decision became final on March 23, 2015.1 Significantly, the respondent does not argue that he attempted to file an appeal, so no procedural issues involved with misfiled or lost appeal forms are before us.
 
While the respondent’s appeal brief mentions legal arguments relating to the question of removability, that question has been decided in a final order, and, except in rare cases, we do not grant a sua sponte motion based on an argument that could have been made on direct appeal. See generally Matter of J-J-, supra. The respondent’s expressed disagreement with the Immigration Judge’s legal conclusions, and his expressed dissatisfaction with the length of the hearing, are in the nature of an attempt to revive an appeal. The respondent has made no persuasive claim that there was, in this case, a miscarriage of justice that might support a finding that extraordinary circumstances exist for a sua sponte grant of reopening. See, e.g. Matter of Farina, 12 I&N Dec. 467, 471-72 (BIA 1967); Matter of Malone, 11 I&N Dec. 730, 731-323 (BIA 1966). We acknowledge, specifically, that the respondent disagrees with the Immigration Judge’s treatment of the statute under which he was convicted as being a categorical match for an aggravated felony.2 Without expressing an opinion as to the merits of this specific issue, we note that the respondent has not cited to any authority that compels the result he seeks, and his disagreement with the Immigration Judge on this matter of law does not constitute a basis for sua sponte reopening. We also acknowledge the respondent’s assertion that the Immigration Judge did not provide a full and fair hearing, but the respondent has not supported that assertion with specific and persuasive arguments, and upon review of the record, we find no basis for concluding that a full and fair hearing was denied.
 
*2 The respondent also mentioned the potential of collateral relief from his criminal conviction. However, as the respondent has presented no evidence that he has sought such relief, we need not address that issue further.
 
Upon consideration of the totality of the record, we agree ultimately with the Immigration Judge that reopening is not warranted. Accordingly, as we decline to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

The record contains a memorandum of the court’s Decision and Orders, which indicates that appeal would be due by March 23, 2015. While the decision was recorded, no transcript was made of the decision, as no direct appeal from the decision was filed. A recording, which the Board has reviewed, exists of the hearing at which the oral decision was read; we take administrative notice that the recording is consistent with the Immigration Judge’s description of the decision. I.J. at 1 (June 11, 2015). We note that the respondent has not indicated that he or his counsel have been prevented from reviewing that recording.

The Notice to Appear indicates that the respondent was convicted, in November, 2004, in the state of Connecticut, of three counts of the offense of Assault on Public Safety/Emergency Medical Personnel, in violation of C.G.S.A. § 53a-167, for each of which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year. The Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion indicates that the Immigration Judge had found that statutory provision to be a categorical match for an aggravated felony crime of violence.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1157(a)(2)(A)(iii)] - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated July 1, 2015, ordering his removal from the United States to Jamaica. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a motion for summary affirmance. We will dismiss the appeal.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. As the Immigration Judge pointed out, the respondent did not identify any form of relief for which he is eligible in these proceedings. The respondent raised no challenge to the finding of removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).
 
The record reflects that the respondent was convicted of one or more criminal offenses in the United States, and he asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in his criminal proceedings, but he has not articulated a basis on which this assertion supports overturning the Immigration Judge’s decision at this time. We acknowledge that the respondent has filed a motion in a Nevada state court to withdraw his guilty plea and vacate judgment with respect to the conviction that forms the basis for the aggravated felony ground of removal in this case. While the respondent is free to pursue a collateral attack in the proper court, the mere fact that he is doing so does not justify further delay in these proceedings. See Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323 (BIA 1996). An alien may not collaterally attack the legitimacy of an otherwise valid federal or state criminal conviction in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Ponce de Leon-Ruiz, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (BIA 1996, 1997; A.G. 1997). Though the respondent asserts he has a persuasive basis for filing a post-conviction motion or motions, this does not render a conviction non-final. See Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009); Matter of Madrigal, supra. Under the circumstances of this case, good cause for a continuance has not been shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6; Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 815 (BIA 2012) (recognizing that an alien should not be granted a continuance “as a dilatory tactic to forestall the conclusion of removal proceedings”).
 
*2 As the respondent’s arguments on appeal do not persuade this Board to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision to order his removal from the United States to Mexico, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Eric Bakken
Senior Attorney
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)] - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document (both respondents) (sustained)
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondents, natives and citizens of Guatemala, were ordered removed in absentia on November 21, 2014.1 On February 20, 2015, the respondents filed a motion to reopen proceedings, which the Immigration Judge denied on April 8, 2015. The respondents filed a timely appeal of that decision. The record will be remanded.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including the determination of credibility, for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including questions of judgment, discretion, and law, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear (Form I-862) was personally served on the respondents on October 7, 2014. On November 5, 2014, a notice of hearing was mailed to the respondent at the address contained on the Notice to Appear, informing her that she was scheduled for a hearing on November 21, 2014. The record does not contain any evidence that the notice of hearing was returned to the Immigration Court. The Immigration Judge ordered the respondents’ removal on November 21, 2014, when they failed to appear for their scheduled hearing. The respondents filed a motion to reopen on February 20, 2015. The Immigration Judge denied the respondents’ motion and the respondents filed a timely appeal.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondents did not establish that rescission of the in absentia order of removal and reopening of these proceedings is warranted based on exceptional circumstances (I.J. at 3-5). See sections 240(b)(5)(A), (C), (e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(A), (C), (e)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondents’ association with a notario does not constitute exceptional circumstances as contemplated under section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
The adult respondent’s declaration is ambiguous as to the degree to which, if any, the respondent relied upon any inaccurate representations made to her by the notario with respect to attending the November 21, 2014, master calendar hearing. The respondent does not detail any particular false or misleading statement made to her by the notario with respect to her attendance at the hearing. She notes only that “Manuel did not tell us that I had to go to court. He did not say anything about that” (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Exh. B at 1). The respondent does not dispute that she received a Notice to Appear that includes a warning indicating that she may be ordered removed if she does not attend a hearing. Thus, the respondent was aware of the consequences of failing to appear, even assuming that the notario did not affirmatively advise her in this regard. Moreover, the respondent’s declaration acknowledges that the notario told her that he was not an attorney. See Singh-Bhathal v. INS, 170 F.3d 943, 946-47 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that reliance on mistaken advice of non-attorney immigration consultant was insufficient to demonstrate exceptional circumstances warranting reopening of in absentia deportation order). Thus, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not establish that exceptional circumstances warrant reopening these proceedings. We also affirm the Immigration Judge’s ruling that because the respondent knowingly retained a non-attorney, she could not establish a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Hernandez v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 1014 (9th Cir. 2008) (aliens’ reliance on deficient advice of immigration consultant who they knew was not an attorney could not support ineffective assistance claim).
 
*2 However, we conclude that remand is warranted for additional consideration of whether the respondent established that she did not receive notice of the November 21, 2014, hearing. The Immigration Judge correctly applied the presumption that the properly addressed notice sent via regular mail was received by the respondent. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 671-72 (BIA 2008). However, in assessing whether the respondent overcame this presumption, the Immigration Judge did not consider all the factors we set forth in Matter of M-R-A-, supra. See also Sembiring v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 981, 986 (9th Cir. 2007). Instead, the Immigration Judge only considered the respondent’s declaration, which the Immigration Judge concluded was insufficient to meet the respondent’s burden of proof.2
 
In light of our conclusion that the Immigration Judge did not appropriately consider the full range of the factors we set forth in Matter of M-R-A-, supra, we conclude that remand is warranted. On remand, the Immigration Judge should consider whether due diligence was exercised in seeking to redress the situation, any prior applications for relief that would indicate an incentive to appear, the respondent’s prior appearance at immigration proceedings, if applicable, and any other factors that may be relevant in determining whether the respondent met her burden of proof to overcome the presumption that she received notice of the hearing. Id. at 674-75. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the issuance of a new decision.
 
Linda S. Wendtland
FOR THE BOARD
Board Member Roger A. Pauley respectfully dissents and would affirm the decision below that the respondent failed to establish a lack of notice or exceptional circumstances warranting reopening. See Joshi v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 732, 735 (7th Cir. 2004) (“a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence”). Furthermore, the majority’s finding that the Immigration Judge failed to consider other relevant factors, despite acknowledging that he enumerated them in his decision, is unfounded.

Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case is before the Board pursuant to a July 28, 2015, order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which granted the motion to remand this matter to the Board to consider what effect, if any, the Supreme Court’s intervening decision in Mata v. Lynch, 135 S. Ct. 2150 (2015), has on its treatment of the respondent’s motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel as a request for sua sponte reopening.
 
It is not clear that the decision in Mata v. Lynch has any direct applicability to our treatment of the respondent’s motion to reopen, since its holding dealt solely with whether the Fifth Circuit properly found it lacked jurisdiction to review the Board’s denial of a motion to reopen. Nevertheless, to the extent that the Supreme Court indicated in Mata that it might be improper to treat untimely or number-barred motions solely as requests to reopen sua sponte, we will reexamine the respondent’s claims on remand, as argued both in the Motion to Remand filed while his appeal was pending before the Board and as argued in a Motion to Reopen he filed on January 14, 2015.
 
In both motions, the respondent urged that the attorney who filed his first motion to reopen filed a patently deficient motion to reopen based on a claim of lack of notice, which led to its denial by the Immigration Judge and prejudiced him. In particular, he contends that counsel did not properly explain the basis of the motion and did not submit evidence in support of the motion that was adequate to establish the respondent’s claim that he did not receive notice of the scheduled hearing below that resulted in an in absentia order of removal being entered by the Immigration Judge on February 1, 2002. Although there is no time limit on motions to reopen claiming a lack of notice, such motions are not specifically exempted from the number limit on motions to reopen. Sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(iii).
 
To the extent that equitable tolling of the time and/or number limits may be found to apply to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, we have found that prejudice must be shown. See, e.g., Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent urges that he was prejudiced by the deficiencies in the first motion, and that his motion would have been granted if the proper arguments were set forth in the motion and if additional evidence had been submitted to support his claim that he did not receive notice of his hearing. Upon review of the all of the evidence presented, including the respondent’s updated affidavit of non-receipt, the cousin’s affidavit of non-receipt, and evidence showing the respondent’s potential eligibility for relief at the time he was placed in proceedings in 2001 (Motion to Reopen filed Jan. 14, 2015, tabs B, C, H, K), it appears likely that the outcome would have been different if this evidence had been presented at the time the initial motion was filed. In other words, it appears likely that if this evidence had been initially presented, the motion would have been granted based upon a consideration of the factors set forth in Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674 (BIA 2008), for determining whether the movant has overcome the lesser presumption of delivery that applies when a notice is sent by regular mail. Under the circumstances, we find that the respondent has shown he was prejudiced such that equitable tolling would be warranted. Moreover, he has presented sufficient evidence that he did not receive notice of the scheduled hearing such that reopening and rescission of the in absentia order is warranted. Matter of M-R-A-, supra.1
 
*2 Accordingly, upon remand from the Fifth Circuit, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen these removal proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order entered on February 1, 2002, is rescinded.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing and for the entry of a new decision.

Even if the Fifth Circuit would not apply equitable tolling, we would find, considering the totality of the evidence presented by the respondent in this case, that an exceptional situation exists warranting sua sponte reopening in our discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paola M. Alvarez de Bennett, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Iran, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 7, 2014, denying his motion to reopen. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Court as discussed below.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including the questions of credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, submitted on May 1, 2014, finding that the motion alleges the same grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel as asserted in the respondent’s first motion to reopen filed on or about February 27, 2014. The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent’s motion was number-barred because it was a second motion to reopen filed in this case. Finally, the Immigration Judge declined to sua sponte reopen the respondent’s proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
In the motion to reopen, the respondent argued that the motion to reopen time and number limitations should be equitably tolled in his case (May 7, 2014, I.J. Motion, at 12-14). However, the Immigration Judge’s decision did not address these arguments. The respondent again argues on appeal that the motion to reopen time and number limitations should be equitably tolled and that he has diligently pursued his claims (Resp. App. Brief, at 7-12). Furthermore, while the respondent’s second motion to reopen repeats essentially the same ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his first counsel, it also included evidence of the respondent’s compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), as well as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his second counsel in failing to make an adequate ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the respondent’s first motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge’s decision did not sufficiently address these arguments. Therefore, before we can perform a meaningful appellate review, we find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge to address the respondent’s arguments presented in the motion, including his arguments regarding equitable tolling of the motion to reopen time and number limitations in light of applicable legal principles. See Mahamat v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1281, 1283 (10th Cir. 2005); Galvez Piñeda v. Gonzales, 127 F.3d 833, 838-39 (10th Cir. 2005); Infanzon v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 1359, 1362-63 (10th Cir. 2004); Riley v. INS, 310 F.3d 1253, 1257-58 (10th Cir. 2002). Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with this order, and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Salim Sheikh, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mark Whitworth
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s August 26, 2014, decision denying his motion to reopen. The respondent was previously ordered removed in absentia on May 31, 2011. The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded only if the alien files a motion to reopen: (1) within 180 days after the date of the removal order in which he establishes that his failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances; or (2) at any time in which he establishes that he did not have proper notice of the hearing in which the removal order was entered. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); see also section 240(e)(1) of the Act (defining the term “““exceptional circumstances”).
 
The respondent asserts that reopening is warranted as he did not receive notice of his May 31, 2011, hearing that resulted in his removal being ordered in absentia. However, as the Immigration Judge properly found, the notice for the hearing, which was mailed on October 20, 2010, was sent to and received by the respondent’s attorney of record at the time (I.J. at 1-2). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent received proper notice inasmuch as written notice of the hearing was provided to his attorney (I.J. at 1-2). See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; see also Men Keng Chang v. Jiugni, 669 F.2d 275, 277-78 (5th Cir. 1982) (finding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (same); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (providing that whenever a person is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to the attorney or representative of record, or to the person himself if unrepresented). Thus, the Immigration Judge determined that reopening was not warranted. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act.
 
The respondent also asserts that his prior attorney did not notify him of the time and place of his hearing, and the attorney did not file a change of venue request. The Immigration Judge properly construed this as a request for reopening under section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act on the basis of exceptional circumstances, and we agree with the Immigration Judge that the request is untimely as the underlying motion was filed more than 3 years after the date of the entry of the in absentia order (I.J. at 2). See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 602-03 (BIA 1996); see also section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act (requiring that a respondent file a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances within 180 days from the date of the in absentia removal order).
 
*2 Motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel claims must be timely filed or be subject to equitable tolling. Although the respondent asserts that there is no time limitation for a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, has not determined if equitable tolling of statutory deadlines for ineffective assistance of counsel applies in immigration cases.1 In addition to the untimeliness of the motion, the respondent has not established what efforts he took to determine the status of his removal proceedings for the 3 years following his order of removal. Cf. Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948, 954 (5th Cir. 2012) (finding that in cases filed before 1992, a motion to reopen could not be denied based on due diligence). We therefore agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established that reopening is warranted under section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
We are unpersuaded by the respondent’s assertion that he suffered a loss of his due process rights with not being afforded an opportunity to obtain counsel (Resp.’s Br. at 9-10). The respondent secured counsel and was represented at the time the hearing notice was mailed on October 10, 2010. Moreover, the respondent’s counsel appeared on his behalf at the May 31, 2011, hearing. While the record demonstrates that the attorney did not include the respondent’s entire address on the written communication, the respondent has not demonstrated that he followed up with his attorney regarding his removal proceedings after he procured representation or explained why he was unable to be reached at the telephone number given to his attorney. As the attorney appeared on the respondent’s behalf at the hearing on May 31, 2011, we are unpersuaded that the respondent’s due process rights were not protected.
 
The respondent further asserts on appeal that he is eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The time and number limits for motions to reopen do not apply where an alien seeks to apply for asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of changed circumstances or country conditions arising in the country of nationality, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), 1003.23(b)(4)(i); see also Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013) (holding that proceedings conducted in absentia may be reopened where the alien seeks asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions). The respondent states that he is afraid to return to Bangladesh. However, the respondent does not allege or discuss any changed country conditions to support his claim, and he has not presented any persuasive evidence of a change in country conditions which is material to his eligibility for asylum (I.J. at 3).
 
*3 Finally, we find no basis for exercising our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings in this case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has stated that an alien’s request for equitable tolling on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is construed as an invitation for the Board to exercise its discretion to reopen proceedings sua sponte. See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir. 2008), abrogated by Mata v. Lynch, 135 S. Ct. 2150, 2155-56 (2015).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Peter Duong, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Tonga, was ordered removed in absentia by an Immigration Judge on February 19, 2008. He filed a motion to reopen on March 18, 2014, which was denied by the Immigration Judge on April 3, 2014, and the respondent timely appeals. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not replied to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
It is undisputed that the respondent had notice of his hearing. The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, finding that the respondent failed to establish “exceptional circumstances” prevented his appearance. The fact that the respondent was afraid that he might be ordered removed if he appeared for his hearing did not constitute exceptional circumstances beyond his control that would excuse his failure to appear. See section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1); Tang v. Ashcroft, 354 F.3d 1192, 1194 (10th Cir. 2003) (holding alien has “the burden of establishing exceptional circumstances warranting rescission” of the removal order).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that he was not advised of the consequences of failing to appear at his hearing. As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent was represented by counsel, who waived the reading of the advisement of the respondent’s requirement to appear (I.J. at 2). To the extent the respondent maintains that his counsel failed to properly advise him, he has not complied with the requirements to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Tang v. Ashcroft, 354 F.3d 1192, 1196-97 (10th Cir. 2003) (no abuse of discretion in the Board’s denial of a motion to reopen where the alien alleged ineffective assistance of counsel but failed to comply with any of the Lozada requirements).
 
*2 The record also reveals that the Notice to Appear (NTA) was personally served on the respondent and the NTA lists, inter alia, his address obligations and failure to appear warnings in English (Exh. 1). There is no statutory or regulatory requirement that the address advisals and failure to appear warnings in the NTA be provided orally or in the respondent’s native language. Current law does not require that the NTA be in any language other than English. See section 239 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229. See also generally Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d 354, 359-60 (5th Cir. 2009); Lopes v. Gonzales, 468 F.3d 81, 84-5 (2d Cir. 2006) (“We reject Silva’s claim that the notices to appear were defective because they did not advise him in his native Portuguese that an in absentia order could be entered against him if he failed to appeal.”); Flores-Chavez v. Ashcroft, 362 F.3d 1150, 1155 n. 4 (9th Cir. 2004); Nazarova v. INS, 171 F.3d 478, 483 (7th Cir. 1999).
 
Moreover, we note that a motion to reopen alleging exceptional circumstances for a failure to appear at a removal hearing must be filed within 180 days of the order of removal, and only one such motion is allowed. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i) & 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent’s motion, filed 6 years after entry of the in absentia removal order, claiming that he failed to appear at the hearing due to exceptional circumstances was untimely, as it was filed well beyond 180 days after the removal order was entered (I.J. at 3).
 
The respondent also proffers evidence that a visa petition has been filed on his behalf. In Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998), the Board held that an alien may reopen for purposes of pursuing previously unavailable relief in circumstances where he was not given oral warnings in his native language of the consequences of failing to appear at a deportation hearing and where the motion complies with the general time limits governing motions to reopen. The motion is untimely filed, however, and thus reopening on this basis is not warranted.
 
We deny the respondent’s request to have transcripts prepared. See Board of Immigration Appeals Practice Manual, 4.2(f)(ii), at 47, available at http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/qapracmanual/BIAPracticeManual.pdf#page=55 (providing that transcripts are not normally prepared for appeals of denials of motions to reopen, including motions to reopen in absentia proceedings). As noted above, the respondent, through service of the NTA at the very least, was properly advised of the consequences of failing to appear, and thus transcripts are not warranted here.
 
*3 For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Patrick W. Lindemann
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 16, 2013, finding him removable as charged and granting him voluntary departure. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is subject to removal from the United States because he is an alien who is present in this country without being admitted or paroled or who arrived at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General (I.J. at 2). See section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). As the respondent is subject to removal from the United States, it is his burden to establish eligibility for relief from removal. See section 240(c)(4)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d).
 
The respondent has not established that, in light of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, these proceedings should be remanded to the Immigration Judge. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Magallanes-Damian v. MS, 783 F.2d 931 (9th Cir. 1986). In particular, the respondent has not established that his former counsel’s performance was so deficient that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. While the respondent argues that his former counsel should have pursued a claim to immigration benefits under the Department of Homeland Security’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program, neither the Immigration Judge, nor this Board can grant the respondent DACA benefits. See generally Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 349-350 (BIA 1982). Instead, if the respondent wishes to pursue DACA benefits, such a request must be filed with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”). Moreover, the respondent has not established that he is prima facie eligible for DACA.1 Furthermore, we note that aliens who are subject to final orders of removal are eligible to request DACA benefits. Thus, the respondent has not established that his former counsel has divested him of the ability to pursue DACA benefits.
 
*2 Considering these circumstances, we conclude the respondent has not shown, in the absence of the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, that a remand of these proceedings would be appropriate based upon his not having established prima facie eligibility for DACA.
 
Lastly, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent a 60-day voluntary departure period, conditioned upon the posting of a $500 bond. Effective January 20, 2009, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3)(ii), an alien granted voluntary departure shall, within 30 days of filing an appeal with the Board, submit sufficient proof that the required voluntary departure bond was posted with the Department of Homeland Security. If the alien does not provide timely proof to the Board, the Board will not reinstate the period of voluntary departure in its final order. Id. The record before the Board does not indicate that the respondent submitted timely proof of having paid the voluntary departure bond. Therefore, the voluntary departure period will not be reinstated, and the respondent shall be removed from the United States on the charge contained in the Notice to Appear, pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s alternate order. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent is ordered removed from the United States pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s alternate order.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Barry Ross Goldberg, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)] - Crime involving moral turpitude
 
 
APPLICATION: Administrative closure
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mali, has timely filed an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 23, 2015, finding the respondent removable as charged under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), and, in the absence of any applications for relief from removal, ordering the respondent removed. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings and for the entry of a new decision.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that removal proceedings should have been administratively closed for the purpose of allowing the respondent to pursue his application for immigration benefits under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program. The Immigration Judge correctly stated that the decision to confer DACA benefits upon an alien as a matter of prosecutorial discretion lies with the exclusive jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and is not subject to review by an Immigration Judge or this Board. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 110 (BIA 2009); Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 349-50 (BIA 1982) (stating that deferred action status is a function of DHS’s prosecutorial discretion). We further observe that DACA may be granted regardless of the outcome of the respondent’s removal proceedings. See USCIA, Frequently Asked Questions, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Q4, www.dhs.gov/deferred-action-childhood-arrivals.
 
The respondent also asserts on appeal that his offenses do not constitute crimes involving moral turpitude, and that the Immigration Judge should have found that the “petty offense” exception applied. The Immigration Judge specifically did not reach the issue of the respondent’s removability under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), observing that is undisputed that the respondent is removable under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. However, we will remand this matter to the Immigration Judge to consider whether the issue of whether the respondent has committed a crime involving moral turpitude is relevant to his DACA application or any other forms of relief the respondent may seek on remand, and, if so, should rule on this issue.
 
*2 In addition, we note the respondent’s appellate assertion that “the fact that counsel for [the respondent] did not file an I-589 application for withholding of removal in light of country conditions in Mali raises substantial questions regarding ineffective assistance of counsel.” We do not need to resolve the issue whether the respondent’s prior counsel was ineffective as, on remand, the respondent will be able to apply for any forms of relief for which he may be eligible.
 
While the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge’s denial of bond was in error, we note that bond and removal proceedings are separate and apart. The Board does not have the authority to review the respondent’s custody status in these proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(d); Matter of P-C-M-, 20 I&N Dec. 432 (BIA 1991); Matter of Balderas, 20 I&N Dec. 389 (BIA 1991).
 
On remand, the parties should be afforded an opportunity to submit further evidence and argument, and the respondent should be permitted to submit applications for any forms of relief for which he may be eligible.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

File: AXXX XX0 047 - Harlingen, TX
August 24, 2015
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ronald S. Salomon, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 26, 2009, when we upheld an Immigration Judge’s order denying a motion to reopen proceedings that were conducted in absentia on October 14, 1998. The respondent has now filed another motion to reopen these removal proceedings. The motion, to which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded, will be denied.
 
In seeking rescission and reopening of the in absentia removal order, the respondent reiterates a claim, previously raised and rejected by both the Immigration Judge and the Board, that the government did not provide her with proper notice of her October 14, 1998, removal hearing. She also appears, for the first time, to fault Jesus Pena, the attorney who assisted her in pursuing a visa petition through her United States citizen spouse after her removal hearing, for her failure to appear at the hearing. The respondent also seeks reopening of these proceedings to apply for adjustment of status based on the now-approved visa petition filed by her United States citizen spouse.
 
We find no basis to rescind the in absentia order and reopen these removal proceedings. First, we have already considered, and rejected, the respondent’s claim that the government did not provide her with adequate notice of her hearing (Board Order dated October 26, 2009). We decline to revisit that issue now.
 
Second, to the extent that the instant motion is based on any alleged ineffective assistance by Pena, it is untimely filed years beyond the general 180-day deadline for seeking rescission of an in absentia removal order based on exceptional circumstances. See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), 1229a(e)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). We further note that the respondent has failed to comply with the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948, 954 (5th Cir. 2012) (acknowledging the Court’s rejection of a flexible approach to the Lozada requirements).
 
Finally, to the extent that the respondent now seeks reopening of these removal proceedings to pursue new relief in the form of adjustment of status, independently of her in absentia claims, the instant motion is untimely and has not been shown to fall within any of the exceptions for motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2) & 1003.23(b)(1) (a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order); Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349, 356-57 (BIA 1998). We also do not find exceptional circumstances that would warrant reopening these proceedings pursuant to our discretionary sua sponte authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).1
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Any request for a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion would have to be pursued before the DHS. Further, should the DHS join the motion to reopen proceedings to pursue adjustment of status, the motion can be refiled. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(iii).

IN RE: JOAO BATISTA RIBEIRO
File: AXXX XX9 835 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Katelyn M. Hufe, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Charles Ireland
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The proceedings in this matter were last before the Board on February 20, 2015. By a decision of that date, the Board dismissed the appeal of the decision of the Immigration Judge of June 26, 2013, which found the respondent removable as charged and denied his motion for a continuance. By the February 20, 2015, decision, the Board also denied a motion to remand filed by the respondent. The motion sought a remand on the basis that evidence obtained as a result of his arrest by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) should be suppressed in light of Oliva-Ramos v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 694 F.3d 259 (3d Cir. 2012).
 
By the motion now before the Board, the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The basis for the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is that former counsel failed to discuss with the respondent the circumstances of his arrest and failed to prepare a motion to suppress the evidence stemming from that arrest which the respondent speculates would have led to the termination of proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the motion.
 
To make out an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, an alien must show that prior counsel’s deficient performance prevented him from reasonably presenting his case and caused him “substantial prejudice.” Fadiga v. Att’y Gen., 488 F.3d 142 at 155 (3d Cir. 2007); Khan v. Att’y Gen., 448 F.3d 226, 236 (3d Cir. 2006); Uspango v. Ashcroft, 289 F.3d 226, 231 (3d Cir. 2002); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003). To evaluate the merits of an ineffectiveness claim, we apply the familiar two-part-error-and-prejudice test. Fadiga, 488 F.3d at 157. First, we ask whether “competent counsel would have acted otherwise.” Id. (quoting Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 129 (2nd Cir. 2000)). If so, we ask whether counsel’s poor performance prejudiced the alien. Id. To prove prejudice, an alien must show that there is a “reasonable likelihood” that the result of the removal proceedings would have been different had the error(s) not occurred. Id. at 159. This standard “properly requires the alien to show not just that he received ineffective assistance in his removal proceedings, but that the challenged order of removal is fundamentally unfair because there is a significant likelihood that the IJ would not have entered an order of removal absent counsel’s errors.” Id.
 
*2 In addition to these substantive requirements, the Board has three procedural requirements for motions to reopen based on ineffectiveness claims as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988): (1) the motion must be supported by an affidavit detailing counsel’s failings; (2) counsel must be informed of the allegations; and (3) the motion must show that disciplinary charges have been filed with the appropriate authority, or if not, adequately explain why not. In this case, the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. At issue, then, is whether or not the respondent suffered the requisite prejudice.
 
It is the position of the respondent that prior counsel was ineffective insofar as he did not discuss the circumstances of his arrest with the respondent and that he failed to submit a motion to suppress to disallow reliance upon information that was gleaned from what the respondent has characterized as an unlawful and racially motivated arrest. The respondent contends that had a motion to suppress been submitted, his removal proceedings would have been terminated upon the granting of the motion. However, it is to be noted that the respondent was found removable based upon pleadings rather than the information contained in the product of his arrest, the Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien (Form I-213). (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 71). While we agree that counsel may have been ineffective in not submitting a motion to suppress, as the Immigration Judge afforded him the opportunity to do so, the respondent has failed to establish “substantial prejudice.” The respondent conceded removability, has not since claimed lawful presence in the United States, and has not submitted an application for relief. As the respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for any relief, the alleged ineffective assistance has not been shown to have potentially affected the outcome of the respondent’s case. Thus, the respondent has not established a basis to remand his case on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lingling Dai, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent has submitted a timely motion to reconsider the Board’s April 30, 2015, decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings in which the Board dismissed his appeal on December 18, 2014. The motion is denied.
 
In denying the respondent’s motion, the Board found that he had not demonstrated compliance with the procedural requirements for reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). With his motion the respondent has submitted various documents, including a supplemental submission indicating that he filed a “preliminary inquiry” with the Committee on Professional Standards on June 17, 2013. This submission is in the nature of a motion to reopen, which is both time and number barred. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, we observe that this document confirms that neither of the two other such forms that the respondent filed with his prior motion to reopen were submitted to the noted committee, as he had alleged. As such, while we find no error in that regard, we do acknowledge that he has provided evidence that he filed a complaint as required by Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
However, we find no error in our determination that the respondent has not provided evidence that he informed his former counsel both of the complaint filed against her and of the contents of the complaint, and provided her an opportunity to respond, as required. Id.; Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644 (5th Cir. 2014). Contrary to the respondent’s suggestions otherwise, we are not required to accept as true his unsupported factual allegations. The respondent’s reliance on case law from a circuit outside the one in which this case arises for this proposition is unavailing (Motion at 4-5). Rather, we apply the law of the circuit in cases arising in that jurisdiction, and are not bound by a decision of a court of appeals in a different circuit. Matter of Salazar, 23 I&N Dec. 223, 235 (BIA 2002). As we find no error in our determination that the respondent did not satisfy the requirements for reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, reconsideration is not warranted. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

FOR RESPONDENTS:
Manpreet Singh Gahra, Esquire
Berkeley, California
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY:
Kathleen W. Taylor
Assistant Chief Counsel
BEFORE: Board Panel: GUENDELSBERGER and MALPHRUS, Board Members; GELLER, Temporary Board Member.
MALPHRUS, Board Member:
This case was last before us on November 5, 2012, when we dismissed the respondents’ appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision, effective on March 16, 2011, denying their applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted and opened for signature Dec. 10, 1984, G.A. Res. 39/46, 39 U.N. GAOR Supp. No. 51, at 197, U.N. Doc. A/RES/39/708 (1984) (entered into force June 26, 1987; for the United States Apr. 18, 1988) (“Convention Against Torture”). The respondents filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has remanded *652 the record to the Board. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.1
  
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Pakistan who was admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor for business on October 11, 2000, with authorization to remain until November 10, 2000. On February 26, 2003, the respondent filed an Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal (Form I-589) and a five-page written declaration with the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”). He subsequently appeared for an interview with an asylum officer. On May 20, 2005, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) served the respondent with a notice to appear for removal proceedings. At a hearing on May 4, 2006, he conceded removability as an overstayed nonimmigrant and filed a second Form I-589.
 
**2 During his testimony, the respondent acknowledged that his first application contained a name and birth date somewhat different from his own. He also admitted that the application contained inaccurate statements indicating that he was arrested five times on specific occasions based on his participation in rallies or protests involving the Pakistan Peoples Party (“PPP”). The respondent also claimed in that application that he had been held for certain specific periods of time ranging from 6 days to 2 months and that he was tortured by various specific means during those detentions.2 By contrast, in his 2006 application, the respondent stated that he had participated in two PPP protests but evaded arrest both times, and he made no claim that he was ever detained or tortured.
 
In her decision, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent was ineligible for asylum because his application was not timely filed within *653 a year of his arrival, as required by section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B) (2006), and his untimely filing was not excused by changed or extraordinary circumstances pursuant to section 208(a)(2)(D). The Immigration Judge evaluated the credibility of the respondent’s claims for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture pursuant to the provisions of section 208(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act, which were enacted by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Division B of Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 302 (“REAL ID Act”). In doing so, she considered the respondent’s filing date to be that of his second application in 2006, relying on Matter of S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 42 (BIA 2006), which held that the REAL ID Act amendments apply to applications filed after May 11, 2005. Applying these provisions, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s claim was not credible.
 
We dismissed the respondent’s appeal from that decision, agreeing that the REAL ID Act applied to the respondent’s claims and upholding the Immigration Judge’s adverse credibility determination. We alternatively determined that the adverse credibility finding would stand under the law that was applicable prior to the REAL ID Act. We did not reach the question whether the respondent was ineligible for relief because his asylum application was untimely filed.
 
The Ninth Circuit has remanded the record for us to further consider, among other issues, the filing date of the respondent’s asylum application for purposes of determining (1) whether the REAL ID Act applies, and (2) whether his application was statutorily barred as untimely filed. The DHS requests that we make determinations regarding these two issues and remand the record to the Immigration Judge. The respondent has submitted no response to the DHS’s request. We conclude that the respondent’s claim for relief is subject to the provisions of the REAL ID Act and that the date of his second asylum application is determinative of whether his asylum application was timely filed.3
  
II. ANALYSIS
  
A. Application of the REAL ID Act
 
**3 The REAL ID Act amended the statute by adding the provisions of section 208(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act, which specify the factors to be *654 considered in making a credibility determination. See REAL ID Act § 101(a)(3), 119 Stat. at 303; see also sections 240(c)(4)(C), 241(b)(3)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(4)(C), 1231(b)(3)(C) (2012). This provision applies to asylum applications that were filed on or after May 11, 2005, whether filed initially before an asylum officer or an Immigration Judge. REAL ID Act § 101(h)(2), 119 Stat. at 305 (providing that the changes to the Act “““shall apply to applications for asylum, withholding, or other relief from removal made on or after” the May 11, 2005, date of enactment); see also Matter of S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. at 43.
 
The respondent submitted two asylum applications. The first was affirmatively filed with the former INS in 2003, and the other was defensively filed in removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge in 2006. The initial question before us is whether the REAL ID Act’s credibility provisions apply to the respondent’s current claims. See Shrestha v. Holder, 590 F.3d 1034, 1039-45 (9th Cir. 2010) (discussing credibility determinations under the REAL ID Act); see also Li Hua Yuan v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 642 F.3d 420, 425 n.9 (3d Cir. 2011) (“Whether the REAL ID Act applies can be significant because it imposes certain conditions upon asylum applicants regarding credibility and corroboration evidence.”).
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s application that was filed before her was subject to the provisions of the REAL ID Act. The respondent argues that this 2006 filing was an amended or renewed application and therefore is not subject to the REAL ID Act. According to the DHS, the REAL ID Act does apply because the respondent’s first asylum application was fraudulent and was replaced by the second application, which was not simply an amendment to his initial filing.
 
The regulations state that an asylum officer or Immigration Judge may permit an asylum applicant “to amend or supplement” the application upon request of the alien and as a matter of discretion. 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.4(c), 1208.4(c) (2015). However, the regulations do not address whether such a supplemented or amended application should be considered a separate filing for purposes of determining if the REAL ID Act applies. One possible interpretation could be that the REAL ID Act provisions apply to any asylum application filed “““on or after” the May 11, 2005, effective date, making such an application subject to the REAL ID Act, regardless of its similarity to a previous one. However, given that the regulations allow for the amendment of an application, we believe that the key consideration in determining if the REAL ID Act applies should be whether the later application is essentially a new one, rather than an amendment or supplement to the original application.
 
**4 *655 We find support for this position in Li Hua Yuan, 642 F.3d 420, where the court found that the REAL ID Act would apply to an asylum application submitted in reopened proceedings in July 2005, even though the respondent had previously filed an application that was denied in 2002. The court held that the second application “raises a new basis for asylum following a motion to reopen and so is a new application rather than a continuation of the initial one.” Id. at 425 n.9.
 
To determine whether a second or subsequent asylum application is “new” and thus subject to the REAL ID Act, we must examine the specific facts and circumstances of each filing. A later filed application that presents a previously unraised basis for relief--such as a fear of persecution on account of a different protected ground--will generally be considered a new application. Even an application that is based on the same protected ground may also be considered a new application if the alien’s later claim is predicated on a new or substantially different factual basis. By contrast, a subsequent application that merely clarifies or slightly alters the initial claim will generally not be considered a new application.
 
The respondent filed an asylum application in 2003, which he admitted, and the Immigration Judge found, was based on a false narrative that he had been arrested following his participation in PPP rallies or protests and was detained five times for periods ranging from 6 days to 2 months, during which detentions he had been tortured. Unlike the initial application, the respondent’s second application, filed in 2006, made no claim that he had been arrested, detained, or tortured. Thus, while the second application was based on the same protected ground, the facts presented there are substantially different from those in the earlier application. The second application did not simply correct minor errors or omissions present in the existing claim. It was not “a continuation of the initial one.” Li Hua Yuan v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 642 F.3d at 425 n.9. Rather, the 2006 filing effectively substituted a new claim for the original one. Under these circumstances, the second application did not supplement or amend the initial application and was, instead, properly viewed as a new application.
 
We conclude that an alien should not be able to bypass the credibility provisions of the REAL ID Act simply because he or she filed an earlier application. This is particularly true here because the respondent’s initial application contained false information, including details of specific incidents of arrest and torture that were central to his original claim but were not included in his later application. We therefore agree with the Immigration Judge that the credibility provisions of the REAL ID Act apply to the respondent’s current claim.
 
**5 Where an applicant’s initial asylum application was filed before May 11, 2005, and a second or subsequent one was submitted on or after *656 that date, the filing date of the later application controls if it is properly viewed as a new one. We emphasize, however, that the filing of a second application after May 11, 2005, alone will not always trigger the application of the REAL ID Act provisions. Rather, each case depends on its own facts and circumstances.
  
B. Timeliness of an Asylum Application
 
Section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Act provides that an alien is not eligible to apply for asylum unless he or she “demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien’s arrival in the United States.” However, an application may be considered “if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant’s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period.” Section 208(a)(2)(D) of the Act; see also, e.g., Vahora v. Holder, 641 F.3d 1038, 1042-48 (9th Cir. 2011); Sagaydak v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 1035, 1039-41 (9th Cir. 2005); Matter of A-M-, 23 I&N Dec. 737, 738-39 (BIA 2005); 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.4(a)(4), (5), 1208.4(a)(4), (5).
 
The respondent entered the United States on October 11, 2000, and filed his first asylum application on February 26, 2003. Although the Immigration Judge stated that she “agreed to consider” this the filing date for purposes of determining whether the statutory time bar applies, we conclude that the determinative date is May 4, 2006, when the respondent filed his second asylum application, given that this application is deemed to be a new one.
 
In Dhital v. Mukasey, 532 F.3d 1044, 1049 (9th Cir. 2008), the Ninth Circuit agreed with our conclusion that because the alien had initially filed a fraudulent asylum application, the date of his second application controlled in determining whether a subsequent application with a new claim was timely filed. In that case, the applicant had been granted asylum under a fraudulent identity and reapplied for asylum after being placed in removal proceedings under his true identity.
 
Similarly, the respondent in this case applied for asylum under a false factual predicate and then submitted a new asylum application before the Immigration Judge after being placed in proceedings. Consistent with the Ninth Circuit’s analysis in Dhital v. Mukasey, we conclude that the date of the respondent’s second asylum application is the relevant date for purposes of determining whether the 1-year statutory bar applies. Because the respondent submitted his application on May 4, 2006, almost 6 years after his arrival in the United States, it was not timely filed. Therefore, his asylum claim is statutorily barred unless he can show either “changed *657 circumstances” or “extraordinary circumstances” to excuse the untimeliness of his application. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(4), (5). The Immigration Judge should further address this issue on remand.4
  
III. CONCLUSION
 
**6 The respondent’s second asylum application is a new application because it was predicated on a substantially different factual basis. Since that application was filed after May 11, 2005, the provisions of the REAL ID Act apply, including those relating to credibility. The date the second asylum application was filed is controlling in determining the timeliness of the respondent’s application for relief. Because that application was submitted almost 6 years after the respondent’s arrival in the United States, it was not timely filed unless he can establish an exception to the 1-year filing requirement. The record will be remanded for further consideration of this and any other remaining issues, including those noted in the Ninth Circuit’s order.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing order and for the entry of a new decision.

1

The lead respondent’s wife and son, who are derivatives of his application, also filed independent asylum applications. They concede that they are not eligible for asylum based on those applications because they were not timely filed. Since we are remanding the record, we need not resolve any issues related to their applications at this time. Our decision will therefore focus on the claims of the lead respondent, whom we will refer to as “the respondent.”

The falsity of the application came to light pursuant to a DHS investigation of a person who assisted the respondent in the preparation of his 2003 asylum application and acted as a translator during his interview. That person was eventually convicted for his role in preparing false asylum applications. At the respondent’s hearing, the DHS presented testimony from the officer who investigated the individual, as well as that of the asylum officer who interviewed the respondent. The Immigration Judge found these witnesses to be credible.

We review the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including those relating to credibility, to determine if they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2015). We review de novo all other questions of law, discretion, and judgment, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

4

We note that the Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s 2003 application was not timely filed and that no extraordinary circumstances excused the delay in filing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5). On appeal, the DHS argued that the Immigration Judge made erroneous findings of fact in her determination, including those regarding when the respondent first made contact with his second attorney, who he claims rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. Since the record will be remanded, we will not evaluate this matter further. The Immigration Judge should consider this argument and make further factual findings and legal determinations, as appropriate.
