IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Noemi E. Masliah, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Adam P. Feller
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on July 17, 2001, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our previous March 30, 2001, decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s February 1, 2000, denial of his motion to reopen the respondent’s December 7, 1998, in absentia order. The respondent has now filed an untimely motion to reopen on May 19, 2008. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be granted pursuant to our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&NDec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
In his current motion, as in his original motion to reconsider which we denied on March 30, 2001,¿FN1º the respondent argues that an in absentia order should not have been issued against him because he appeared at the hearing 45 minutes late due to circumstances beyond his control. He elaborates, as he did in his original motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, that his subway train was delayed and that once he arrived at the courthouse, he was misdirected to the courtroom. Morever, for the first time, his current motion asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at this hearing from two prior attorneys, who failed to properly file a timely motion to reopen his in absentia hearing, and he was thereby precluded from presenting his applications for withholding of removal and voluntary departure. For its part, the DHS argues that the respondent’s description of the procedures at the courthouse are inaccurate, and that the respondent failed to submit any evidence in support of his claim that his subway train was late. The DHS does not address the respondent’s claim regarding the effectiveness of his prior counsels.
 
As an initial matter, we agree that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel from his former counselors. Subsequent to the in absentia order issued by the Immigration Judge, Ms. Reede, Esquire, informed the respondent that she would file a motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, but such motion was ultimately filed late and denied by the Immigration Judge on February 1, 2000. Inasmuch as Ms. Reede’s motion was late and deficient on its face, we can presume that the respondent was prejudiced thereby. See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Moreover, we find that the respondent’s second attorney, Mr. Oeser-Sweate, Esquire, failed to properly file an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his former counsel, and the lack of such a motion further prevented the respondent from presenting his requests for relief from removal. Id. In support of the respondent’s allegations, the respondent has submitted, inter alia, a copy of a motion prepared by Mr. Oeser-Sweate, outlining the ineffective nature of his prior counsel, and his accompanying affidavit, he alleges that this motion was improperly filed with the New York ICE office but never with the Immigration Court.¿FN2º The respondent has filed disciplinary complaints against Mr. Oeser-Sweate and Mr. Murado,¿FN3º and has substantially met the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has stated that “¿iºn a situation where ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from having the opportunity to present his case for relief, the filing deadline for motions to reopen will be equitably tolled until the ineffective assistance is, or should have been, discovered by a reasonable person in the situation.” See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 171 (2d Cir. 2006); citing Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir. 2000); see also Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154, 157 (2d Cir. 2006). In this case, we find that the respondent has adequately explained that his prior counsels prevented him from presenting his applications for relief, and in delaying his ability to file an ineffective assistance of counsel alleging this fact. The respondent, through current counsel, effectively sets forth this ineffective assistance of counsel claim with due diligence, inasmuch as it attempts to remedy Mr. Oeser-Sweate’s and Ms. Reede’s errors. See Cekic v. INS, supra, at 170 (“no matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled”). Specifically, the respondent has explained that his delay in the current motion resulted from the misleading assurances he received from Ms. Reede, and the inadequate representation provided by her and by Mr. Oeser-Sweate.
 
Lastly, we note that the Immigration Judge, in his February 1, 2000, denial of the respondent’s initial motion to reopen his in absentia hearing, held that even were the motion timely, he would still deny it because the respondent’s late train does not constitute “exceptional circumstances” to excuse his absence at the hearing (2000 I.J. Dec. at 3). However, were it not for Ms. Reede and Mr. Murado’s inability to appear at the hearing at the proper time, and their failure to properly guide the respondent through the process once he arrived at the Immigration Court, he may have avoided an in absentia removal order. In this vein, we note that recent case law out of United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held that such short delays may not be considered a “failure to appear” for purposes of in absentia hearings. See Abu Hasirah v. DHS, 478 F.3d 474 (2d Cir. 2007). In short, given the circumstances, we find that the motions deadline should be excused under our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, supra. Accordingly, the record is remanded in order to afford the respondent an opportunity to pursue his application for withholding of removal before the Immigration Judge, as well as his more recent request to apply for adjustment of status based on an approved Form I-130 visa petition.

1

The respondent’s motion to reconsider, which we denied on July 17, 2001, merely argued that we “rubber-stamped” the Immigration Judge’s December 7, 1998, in our March 30, 2001, decision. It does not directly address the underlying in absentia decision, but in effect requests that the Board reconsider the basis of the Immigration Judge’s in absentia removal order.

2

We note, incidentally, that the motion posits the same claims present in the pending motion to reopen.

The respondent has indicated that Ms. Reede is now deceased. Mr. Murado, Esquire, assisted Ms. Reede in her representation of the respondent.

File: AXXX XX9 639 - Boston, MA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Obadan Iziokhai, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s order dated November 16, 2007. The appeal will be sustained.
 
The facts and pertinent history of the case are as follows. On September 1, 2006, the respondent filed (with the Immigration Court) his Application to Adjust Status (Form I-485) and supporting documents, including an approval notice for the visa petition filed on his behalf by his United States citizen spouse. On July 27, 2007, the Immigration Court sent a hearing notice for October 30, 2007, to the respondent’s former counsel (Gordie Daniels). The respondent did not appear for the October 30, 2007, hearing and the Immigration Judge subsequently entered an in absentia order.
 
The respondent filed a motion to reopen on November 5, 2007. The respondent’s motion was supported by his declaration made under the penalty of perjury. The respondent stated in his declaration that on or about October 25, 2007, present counsel (Obadan Iziokhai) informed the respondent he would represent him at the next hearing because Mr. Daniels was out of the country. The respondent stated that Mr. Iziokhai informed him the hearing was set for October 31, 2007. The respondent stated Mr. Iziokhai told him that he could not find the respondent’s file at Mr. Daniel’s office so he contacted the Immigration Court and was told by a clerk the hearing was scheduled for October 31, 2007.¿FN1º The respondent stated that he and his wife appeared for the hearing at the Immigration Court on October 31, 2007, and were told the hearing had been conducted on October 30, 2007. The respondent also submitted in support of his motion a letter from his employer which stated that he had taken off from work on October 31, 2007, specifically to attend the hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion in a brief order dated November 16, 2007 (and mailed on November 26, 2007). The respondent timely appealed.
 
Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), provides, in pertinent part, an in absentia order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the removal order if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances.
 
We find that the respondent has shown exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear at the October 30, 2007, hearing. In Kaweesa v. Gonzales, 450 F.3d 62, 68 (1st Cir. 2006), the court stated that in deciding the validity of a claim of exceptional circumstances, the totality of the circumstances must be considered. Here the respondent appeared for the hearing the next day (October 31, 2007), obtained a letter from his employer which stated he took off work on October 31, 2007, specifically to attend the hearing, and promptly filed a motion to reopen supported by his declaration and the employer letter on November 5, 2007. We note that the respondent appears eligible for adjustment of status, based on an approved immediate relative visa petition filed on his behalf. Although the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to allege ineffective assistance of counsel have not been met, it is clear from the record that the respondent did not appear for the October 30, 2007, hearing because of misinformation from Mr. Iziokhai. We held in Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996), that ineffective assistance of counsel could constitute exceptional circumstances to rescind an in absentia order. We noted that an alien is not required to show prejudice in order to rescind an in absentia order. Id, at 473 n.2. We thus conclude that the respondent has shown exceptional circumstances.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s decision is reversed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kenneth Finn, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on May 20, 2008, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s February 6, 2008, decision ordering him removed from the United States to Trinidad and Tobago. The respondent has now, on August 15, 2008, filed a timely motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen shall not be granted unless it appears that the evidence sought to be offered “was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” See 8C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Further, this Board has held that a party who seeks to reopen proceedings to pursue a discretionary grant of relief from removal bears a “heavy burden” of demonstrating that if his motion to reopen were granted, the new evidence presented would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). In the respondent’s case, we do not find the evidence in support of his motion material. Unfortunately, regardless of the respondent’s letters of support, he remains ineligible for cancellation of removal due to his aggravated felony conviction. As we explained in our prior May 20, 2008, decision, his 2005 conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine bars him from such relief under section 240A(a)(3) of the Act. While the respondent now argues in his motion that he should not be considered an aggravated felon pursuant to the United States Supreme Court holding in Lopez v. Gonzalez, 127 S.Ct. 625 (2006), we explained in Matter of Aruna, 24 I&N Dec. 452 (BIA 2008) that even though the respondent may only have been sentenced to 364 days, his conviction is an aggravated felony because a state drug offense which corresponds to a Federal felony qualifies as a “drug trafficking crime” aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act.
 
The respondent also requests that we reconsider our previous decision because, first, he only had sufficient drugs in his possession to be considered for “personal use,” and, secondly, because he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his criminal hearing. We can not go beyond the record of conviction to consider these arguments. See Matter of Khalik, 17 I&N Dec. 518 (BIA 1980). Accordingly, we find no reason to disturb our prior decision, and the motion is denied.

September 8, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Louis Gvzmann, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This is an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision of October 15, 2007, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, on the ground that he did not file his motion within 90 days of the Immigration Judge’s decision of June 15, 2007, as required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent had not established changed country conditions in the country to which removal has been ordered, Honduras, and that the respondent therefore failed to demonstrate that he qualified for an exception to the filing requirements. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4). The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent had not established the prerequisites needed to reopen this matter based on ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion requesting a stay of his voluntary departure, on the ground that no substantial grounds had been advanced to warrant its grant. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that he filed two motions to reopen, and the Miami Immigration Court ignored his request and, failed to act, and neither denied nor approved either of the two motions. He also claims that the Immigration Court did not entertain his motion to stay his voluntary departure, or to change venue to the Orlando Immigration Court. He asserts that he is entitled to this relief so that he can have his case reopened and pursue his claim for asylum relief.
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge did in fact, issue a decision dated October 15, 2007, in response to the respondent’s motions. The record also reflects that the respondent’s attorney was served with the Immigration Judge’s decision on October 16, 2007. A timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion was filed with this Board by counsel for the alien on October 21, 2007.
 
We will deny the respondent’s motion, as it failed to meet the regulatory requirements. A motion to reopen on factual grounds must be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary materials. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The applicant must show that the evidence is material, unavailable at the time of the original hearing, and could not have been discovered or presented at the original hearing. Such a motion shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that these criteria are met. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Upon review of the respondent’s motion we find that he has submitted no evidentiary material, other than his own affidavit, and does not assert that there is material evidence which was unavailable and could not have been discovered at the original hearing. The respondent’s motion therefore does not meet the aforementioned regulatory criteria. We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to demonstrate that he was rendered ineffective assistance of counsel, as he did not meet the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and therefore a claim of ineffective assistance could not serve as a basis for the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
*2 In this case, it appears that the respondent’s motion was not timely, as the record reflects that the Immigration Judge’s decision was rendered on June 15, 2007, and the respondent’s motion was not received by this Board until September 18, 2007. We note that the respondent sought a stay of his voluntary departure. However, since his motion to reopen was not timely, the recent Supreme Court decision in Dada v. Mukasey, 123 S. Ct. 2307 (2008), does not apply to this case. We find that Dada requires that, in order for the alien to be allowed to obtain the benefit of its holding, i.e., the right to unilaterally withdraw his/her voluntary departure request without regard to the merits of the motion to reopen, the alien’s motion to reopen must be timely, i.e., filed within 90 days. We note that the Court cites to the statutory provision governing the deadline for filing motions to reopen, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). Moreover, the Court noted that its decision to allow an alien to withdraw his/her voluntary departure request and pursue his/her motion is premised, at least in part, upon the notion that it is completely foreseeable that the time allowed for voluntary departure will expire long before the BIA issues a decision on a timely filed motion to reopen. Id. at 2316. We find that this clearly shows that Dada mandates that the respondent’s motion to reopen be timely in order for him to be able to withdraw his voluntary departure request and pursue his motion. Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Laura A. Michalec
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
  
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen; termination of proceedings
 
In a decision dated January 9, 2007, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable, and ordered him removed to Ecuador. The respondent’s appeal to the Board was denied as untimely on May 14, 2007. On June 4, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s April 22, 2008, untimely motion to reopen. The respondent appealed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is an approximately 52-year-old native and citizen of Ecuador. The respondent entered the United States on or about April 28, 1974, as a visitor. He adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident on or about August 30, 1979. On February 28, 2006, he was convicted in the Supreme Court, New York County, New York, of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree, cocaine. He was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment. He did not file a direct appeal. The Supreme Court, New York County, New York, agreed to accept his late appeal on May 15, 2007. The respondent asserts that the proceedings should be reopened, even though his motion is untimely, because his conviction is no longer final; further, his attorney did not file an appeal leading to the dismissal of his pro se appeal as untimely. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) opposes the motion because, it argues, the motion is untimely and he remains removable for the 2006 conviction. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23.
 
Arguably, the respondent has not substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). He did not inform his former attorney that he was filing a complaint with the New York State Bar to give him an opportunity to respond to the allegations. Nevertheless, the motion to reopen depends on the argument that his former counsel was ineffective by failing to file an appeal. We note there is no evidence the respondent and his attorney agreed to file an appeal. The attorney was not clear that he would file an appeal at the hearing and the respondent at that time was given instructions how to file an appeal and the proper forms (Tr. at 12-15). The respondent himself subsequently filed an untimely appeal on March 28, 2007, but failed to meet the requirements and did not return the appeal until April 19, 2007. In addition, he did not show due diligence in filing his motion, failing to raise his claim until almost a year after the Board dismissed his appeal. Chen v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 267 (2d Cir. 2006).
 
*2 Further, to show ineffective assistance of counsel prejudice must be shown. Omar v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 647 (2d Cir. 2008). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004) (alien must show outcome might have been affected). The respondent has proffered no errors in the Immigration Judge’s decision which would demonstrate that the decision could have been reversed on appeal. Thus, he has not demonstrated prejudice from the failure of his former attorney to file an appeal. The filing of a post-conviction motion with the state court is not a ground for reopening a removal proceeding. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48); Matter of Marroquin, 23 I&N Dec. 705 (BIA 1997; A.G. 2005); Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894 (BIA 1994); see also Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750, 751-52 (BIA 1993).
 
The respondent claims he is not removable because his request to appeal his controlled substance conviction has been granted. There is no requirement that all appeals be exhausted before a conviction is final for immigration purposes. See Puello v. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, 511 F.3d 324 (2d Cir. 2007); see also Abiodun v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 1210 (10th Cir. 2006); Montenegro v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 1035 (7th Cir. 2004) (per curiam); Moosa v. INS, 171 F.3d 994 (5th Cir. 1999).
 
Insofar as the respondent argues he is not guilty of the crime of which he was convicted, the Board cannot go behind the conviction to determine guilt or innocence. Matter of Roberts, 20 I&N Dec. 294 (BIA 1991); Matter of Fortis, 14 I&N Dec. 576 (BIA 1974); see Matter of Mendez-Morales, 21 I&N Dec. 296 (BIA 1996); Matter of Reyes, 20 I&N Dec. 789 (BIA 1994). Likewise, matters involving state law are beyond the scope of our jurisdiction. The respondent must address his arguments to the state court. The respondent also argues he can apply for a waiver under former section 212(c) of the Act. The United States Supreme Court has held that the restrictions on section 212(c) relief do not apply retroactively to those aliens, who pled guilty to criminal offenses prior to April 24, 1996. See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). The respondent was convicted on February 28, 2006, and a waiver under former section 212(c) is not available to him. As the respondent is not eligible for discretionary relief, his long residence and family ties or hardship upon removal cannot be considered.
 
*3 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed. ORDER: The appeal will be dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
George P. Mann, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael B. Dobson
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the denial of her motion to reopen in absentia removal proceedings by the Immigration Judge. She claims that she did not receive notice of her hearing due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a request for summary affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision. This matter will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
The Immigration Judge incorrectly applied the 180-day deadline to the respondent’s motion to reopen, finding that it was based on a claim of exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear at her removal hearing. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(b)(5)(C)(i)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
We agree with the respondent’s assertion that prior counsel’s failure to file an entry of appearance, and failure to notify the Immigration Court of a change of address on behalf of the respondent, are facts that, if established, would lead to a finding that the respondent was a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, the record is replete with evidence of malfeasance on the part of this attorney, which may contribute to the credibility of the respondent’s assertions. Therefore, this matter will be remanded to the Immigration Judge to assess whether ineffective assistance of counsel prevented the respondent from receiving the hearing notice.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order and for the entry of a new decision.

The Immigration Judge subsequently rendered a new decision on September 5, 2006, and the respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines, appeals from that decision presently. In support of the appeal, the respondent argues: (I) that the Immigration Judge’s September 5, 2006, decision fails identify and fully explain the reasons for the denial of the motion to reopen; and (2) that the Immigration Judge erroneously denied the motion to reopen because the ineffective assistance of the respondent’s prior counsel should have been invoked to equitably toll the time and numeric limitations on motions to reopen (Respondent’s Br. at 3-9). See generally, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (2008) (setting forth time and numeric limitations on motions to reopen filed before the Immigration Judge after entry of final administrative order). As we disagree on both counts, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
First, we find no merit to the respondent’s contention that the Immigration Judge’s decision is legally deficient because, as the respondent asserts, the Immigration Judge “adopted the ¿Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”)º rationale without further analysis (Respondent’s Br. at 2).” While certain portions of the Immigration Judge’s decision evidently draw upon the arguments offered in the DHS’s response in opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen filed on May 19, 2006, there is nothing in the Immigration and Nationality Act (“the Act”) or its attendant regulations that prevents the Immigration Judge from drawing upon the arguments offered by the parties to the proceeding in the course of reaching and articulating a decision. All that we require when an Immigration Judge renders a ruling on a motion to reopen is that the Immigration Judge “identify and fully explain the reasons for such decision,” and the Immigration Judge’s September 5, 2006, decision satisfies this basic adjudicative criterion. See Matter of M-P-, supra.
 
Second, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s arguments on appeal that the ineffective assistance of his prior counsel should be invoked to equitably toll the time and numeric limitations on motions to reopen. Indeed, we are not persuaded that the respondent’s prior counsel acted ineffectively. The respondent, represented by former counsel, filed the first motion to reopen on March 17, 2006, which, as the Immigration Judge correctly observed and the respondent does not contest, was 7 days after the expiration of the respondent’s voluntary departure period on March 10, 2 007 (I.J. at 1 (Sept. 5, 2006)). Rather than take an appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 29, 2006, decision denying the first motion to reopen, the respondent retained present counsel of record and filed a second motion to reopen on May 9, 2006, which is both numerically and time-barred under the governing regulatory provision, a legal conclusion that the respondent also does not contest. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The purpose of both motions to reopen was to apply for adjustment of status pursuant to Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002) on the basis of a marriage to a United States citizen on December 19, 2005, which was 21 days prior to the entry of the final administrative order dated January 9, 2006, granting the respondent the privilege of voluntarily departing the United States on or before March 10, 2006 (I.J. at 1).
 
*2 We note that the Immigration Judge appropriately denied the respondent’s first motion to reopen because the respondent was ineligible to adjust his status as a result of his failure to voluntarily depart the United States before the expiration of the voluntary departure period. See section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c. Against this backdrop we turn to the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and we observe at the outset that such claims require, among other things, “that the motion to reopen be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard.” See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 603 (BIA 1996) (emphasis added) (citing Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988)). The substance of the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is that: (1) he retained the former counsel in December of 2005 to file a motion to reopen to enable him to apply for adjustment of status (Respondent’s M.T.R., Exhs. B, C (May 9, 2006)); (2) the respondent repeatedly contacted the former counsel concerning his case, and he was assured the motion to reopen was filed on time (Respondent’s M.T.R., Exhs. B, C (May 9, 2006)); and (3) “due to an error on ¿ the former counsel’sº part, the motion was not timely filed (Respondent’s M.T.R., exhs. B, C (May 9, 2006)).”
 
Such generalized, vague, and unsupported assertions are insufficient to establish any ineffectiveness on the part of the respondent’s former counsel, particularly so when they are scrutinized in light of the evidence in the record of proceeding. The respondent’s first motion to reopen contains 5 exhibits marked A through E, all of which except for exhibit E relate to the bona fides of the underlying marriage (Respondent’s M.T.R. (March 17, 2006)). As we examine these exhibits, it is evident to us that the respondent, and not respondent’s prior counsel, must bear the chief responsibility for whatever delay there may have been in properly filing the motion before the Immigration Judge. Bearing in mind that the respondent was married on December 19, 2005, we note the following. First, the Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, was not received by the DHS until January 25, 2006 (Respondent’s M.T.R., exh. B (March 17, 2006)). Second, exhibit C attached to the respondent’s motion to reopen contains an assortment of letters and a bank statement bearing dates ranging February 1 to 6, 2006 (Respondent’s M.T.R., exh. C (March 17, 2006)). Third, the sine qua non of the respondent’s first motion to reopen motion, the Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, shows that it was signed and dated by the respondent on March 1, 2006, and that it was apparently faxed to the respondent’s former counsel on March 2, 2006 (Respondent’s M.T.R., exh. D (March 17, 2006)). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(c) (providing that a motion to reopen filed for the purpose of applying for relief from removal must be accompanied by the requisite application). The respondent’s former counsel subsequently paid the required fee for the motion to reopen on the following day; however, the motion to reopen was not properly filed until March 17, 2006 (Respondent’s M.T.R. (March 17, 2006)). Thus, from this evidence it is clear to us that the respondent’s former counsel could only act as quickly as permitted by the respondent’s piecemeal manner of supplying him with the requisite evidentiary documents in support of the first motion to reopen. Although there is an unexplained 2-week gap between the date on which the filing fee was paid and the date on which the motion to reopen was actually filed, much of this elapsed time is irrelevant because the critical date here is March 10, 2006, the date on which the respondent’s voluntary departure period elapsed.
 
*3 Thus, in view of the fact that (1) the Immigration Judge has discretionary authority to establish time limits for the DHS’s reply to the respondent’s motion to reopen, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1)(iv); (2) the Immigration Judge allowed the DHS 10 days within which to reply to the respondent’s first motion to reopen as well as to the respondent’s second motion to reopen; and (3) the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s first motion to reopen 12 days after it was filed on March 29, 2006, and denied the respondent’s second motion on June 1, 2006, 22 days after it was filed, there is no basis upon which to presume that the motion would have been adjudicated before the expiration of the respondent’s voluntary departure period even had it been properly filed before March 10, 2006. See Chedad v. Gonzales, 497 F.3d 57, 64 (1st Cir. 2007) (“The relevant provisions of the act simply do not contemplate suspending the voluntary departure period so that aliens who have chosen that form of relief also can pursue reopening.”); see also Matter of Shaar, 21 I. & N. Dec. 541 (BIA 1996), aff’d, 141 F.3d 953 (9th Cir. 1998).
 
In conclusion, we reemphasize the importance of providing a detailed statement in support of the respondent’s ineffectiveness of counsel claim describing “the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard.” See Matter of Rivera, supra. In this case, the evidence submitted for the purpose of establishing the claimed ineffectiveness neither describes the terms according to which the work was to be performed nor how the former counsel’s performance of the work was ineffective. Hence, the respondent has failed to meet his burden of proving that reopening on the basis of his former counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness is warranted. See section 240(c)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4) (providing that an alien applying for relief from removal has the burden of establishing that he meets all applicable eligibility requirement for relief and that he merits a favorable act of discretion); accord 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). Thus, we need not reach the respondent’s equitable tolling argument. The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael A. Leppala
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) º - Convicted of aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
  
APPLICATION: Termination
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Trinidad and Tobago and lawful permanent resident of the United States, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s June 4, 2008, decision ordering him removed as convicted of an aggravated felony on the basis of his Texas conviction for “delivery by actual transfer of cocaine less than 1 gram.” The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that his conviction under section 481.112 of the Texas Health and Safety Code does not constitute an aggravated felony because the statute of conviction is divisible and he argues that his record of conviction does not demonstrate that he was convicted of a “drug trafficking crime.” (Respondent’s Brief at 14.) The respondent also contends that he was denied due process because he alleges that the Immigration Judge did not “scrupulously and conscientiously probe into, inquire of, and explore for all the relevant facts,” his Texas conviction resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel, his conviction is not an aggravated felony as a matter of law, and he should have been permitted to file an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) (Respondent’s Brief at 3-5). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) contends that the Immigration Judge properly found the respondent to be convicted of an aggravated felony and thus ineligible for discretionary relief because the transfer of cocaine is punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”). See 21 U.S.C. §§ 802(8), (11), (44), 812(c), 841(a), (b)(1)(C).
 
As an initial matter, we reject the respondent’s due process claims because we find that his hearing was “fundamentally fair.” See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980); Matter of Toro, 17 I&N Dec. 340 (BIA 1980). In particular, the Immigration Judge clearly explained the charges filed by DHS and provided the respondent with opportunities to obtain counsel and file an application for relief (Tr. at 9, 15-17, 22). In addition, reliance on the uncontested evidence of the respondent’s Texas conviction does not violate due process as it is well-settled that neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board has the authority to look beyond a record of conviction to determine the guilt or innocence of an alien in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Reyes, 20 I&N Dec. 789 (BIA 1994); Matter of Fortis, 14 I&N Dec. 576 (BIA 1974). Moreover, because the Immigration Judge found that the respondent was convicted of an aggravated felony, which conviction renders the respondent ineligible for discretionary relief such as cancellation of removal, it was not improper to allow the respondent only to apply for mandatory forms of relief from removal. See sections 208(b)(2)(B)(i) and 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(2)(B)(i), 1229b(a)(3). Furthermore, we reject the respondent’s assertion of mere legal error as a basis for his due process claim. See, e.g., Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, 255 F.3d 775, 780 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that “an allegation of mere legal error does not constitute a colorable due process claim”).
 
*2 We also reject the respondent’s contention that his Texas conviction for “delivery by actual transfer of cocaine less than 1 gram” does not constitute an aggravated felony. Even if we agreed with the respondent that section 481.112 of the Texas Health and Safety Code is divisible under the categorical approach because it punishes “deliver¿yº, or possess¿ionº with intent to deliver a controlled substance,” which encompasses conduct that would constitute only a misdemeanor under federal law, such as simple possession of marihuana or “distributing a small amount of marihuana for no remuneration,” see 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(4), 844(a); but see Matter of Aruna, 24 I&N Dec. 452 (BIA 2008,), the respondent’s judgment of conviction indicates that he was convicted under the “delivers” portion of the Texas statute and that cocaine was the controlled substance at issue, which constitutes a drug trafficking crime because it corresponds to the felony drug offense of distribution of a Schedule II controlled substance under the CSA. See 21 U.S.C. §§ 802(8), (11), (44), 812(c), 841(a), (b)(1)(C); see also United States v. Cormier, 468 F.3d 63, 70 n.3 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v. Durham, 464 F.3d 976, 981 n.7 (9th Cir. 2006); United States v. Hester, 140 F.3d 753, 760-61 (8th Cir. 1998); United States v. Jackson, 55 F.3d 1219, 1226 (6th Cir. 1995); United States v. Washington, 41 F.3d 917, 919-20 (4th Cir. 1994). Finally, we note that the respondent’s contention that he is not a recidivist is not relevant here because the respondent’s aggravated felony charge is based on his conviction for “delivery by actual transfer of cocaine” rather than recidivist possession. Thus, the Immigration Judge properly concluded that the respondent is removable as convicted of an aggravated felony and is not eligible for discretionary relief.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tatiana S. Aristova, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)º Convicted of crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Uzbekistan, has timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s June 10, 2008, decision denying his motion to reopen. The respondent’s request for oral argument before this Board is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Initially, we will review the procedural history in this case. On November 7, 2002, the respondent was served with a Notice to Appear. On August 28, 2003, the Immigration Judge granted a motion to administratively close proceedings filed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). On August 25, 2005, the Immigration Judge granted the DHS’s motion to recalendar. The order noted that a master calendar hearing was scheduled for January 24, 2006. On January 24, 2006, the respondent’s prior attorney was provided notice of a hearing scheduled on January 31, 2006, On January 31, 2006, the Immigration Judge entered an in absentia removal order against the respondent.
 
More than 2 years later, on April 10, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen his in absentia removal order with the Immigration Judge. The respondent claimed that he went to Canada on or about January 27, 2006, and that on January 30, 2006, his mother received a telephone call from his prior attorney advising him of the hearing scheduled for the following day. The respondent’s motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge contains a copy of a complaint to the Pennsylvania bar regarding his prior attorney, a letter to his prior attorney informing him of the complaint, and a statement regarding his motion to reopen. On June 10, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent now appeals that decision to this Board. The respondent’s brief on appeal indicates that he is in Canada.
 
We note that generally, “¿aº motion to reopen or to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal … proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). However, the present case constitutes an exception to this general rule because it involves an in absentia removal order. Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(h), an in absentia order may be rescinded by filing a motion to reopen: 1) within 180 days of the issuance of the order if the alien can show that exceptional circumstances excused his failure to appear or 2) “at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the ¿Immigration and Nationalityº Act ¿8 U.S.C. §§ 1229(a)(1) or (2)º, or … he or she was in … custody and the failure to appear was through no fault of the alien.” “Exceptional circumstances” are defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(l), as those circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as being in federal custody, serious illness, or death of an immediate relative. Ineffective assistance of counsel has been held to qualify as an “exceptional circumstance” which excuses an alien’s absence and allows reopening of removal proceedings in which an in absentia removal order is issued. See Borges v. Gonzales, 402 F.3d 398, 407-408 (3d Cir. 2005). Here, the respondent claims that he was not notified of the removal hearing in time to attend due to his prior counsel’s ineffective assistance. Consequently, the Board has jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen the in absentia removal order. See generally Contreras-Rodriguez v. United States Attorney General, 462 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir. 2006) (finding that the Board and the Immigration Judge retain jurisdiction to reopen proceedings to address whether an alien received sufficient notice of the in absentia removal hearing).
 
*2 Nevertheless, we find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion. As set forth above, the respondent is claiming that he did not receive notice of the hearing based on ineffective assistance, which the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, has held may constitute an exceptional circumstance. See Borges v. Gonzales, supra. The respondent did not file his motion to reopen his in absentia removal order within 180 days of the order as required when claiming exceptional circumstances. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Moreover, inasmuch as he admits on appeal that his prior attorney notified his mother of the hearing the night before the hearing and that she informed him of the attorney’s telephone call, the respondent cannot show that the 180-day filing deadline for the motion to reopen should be equitably tolled. Therefore, we will dismiss the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen the in absentia removal order.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raymond J. Sanders, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Judson J. Davis
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 The procedural posture of this case is as follows. At a sixth master calendar hearing held on April 20, 2004, the respondent, a native and citizen of Pakistan, conceded removability, agreed to voluntarily depart the United States on or before June 20, 2004, and waived his right to appeal. The respondent had been granted five continuances to afford the labor department time to adjudicate his pending labor certification. See Immigration Judge’s written decision issued June 30, 2004.
 
On June 15, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. He sought adjustment of status under former section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1255(i), based on his pending employment based immigrant visa petition (I-140). On January 24, 2005, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen.¿FN1º On July 8, 2005, and December 26, 2007, we denied the respondent’s first and second motions filed with this Board as being time and number barred. See sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § §1229a(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) (an alien may file one motion to reopen and, with certain exceptions not relevant here, it shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal).
 
On August 4, 2008, the respondent filed his third motion to reopen with this Board. Again, the respondent’s motion will be denied as time and number barred. A final administrative order was issued in this case over three years ago on January 24, 2005. The respondent asks us to reopen these proceedings on our own motion. This Board’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
First, he asserts that his due process rights were denied when the Immigration Judge failed to inform him of his right to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1255(i). The respondent’s argument is misplaced. The Immigration Judge granted the respondent five continuances so that the could obtain an approved labor certification, a prerequisite to adjustment of status. We observe that this record does not contain a copy of the respondent’s pre-April 30, 2001, labor certification allegedly filed by Prembro, Inc. on April 21, 2001. See Respondent’s Motion at 1.
 
*2 Second, the respondent asserts that these proceedings should be reopened because his waiver of his right to appeal was not knowing and voluntary. Contrary to the respondent’s assertions, he was granted voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), which does not require that an alien waive his right to appeal. See Immigration Judge’s written decision issued June 30, 2004. Insofar as the respondent blames his prior counsel for waiving his right to appeal, he has failed to comply with the requirements for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Also, equitable tolling of the 90-day motions deadline is not warranted here. In a recent unpublished case, the Fifth Circuit observed that an argument for equitable tolling “is in essence an argument that the BIA should have exercised its discretion to reopen the proceeding sua sponte based upon the doctrine of equitable tolling.” See Ben Jie Lin v. Mukasey, 2008 WL 2725317 (5th Cr. July 11, 2008). The respondent has not established exceptional circumstances warranting sua sponte reopening. See Matter of J-J-, supra.
 
Finally, the respondent asks that we reopen these proceedings based on the United States Supreme Court’s recent decision in Dada v. Mukasey, 128 S. Ct. 2307 (2008). In that case, the Supreme Court held that “… to safeguard the right to pursue a motion to reopen for voluntary departure recipients, the alien must be permitted to withdraw, unilaterally, a voluntary departure request before expiration of the departure period, without regard to the underlying merits of the motion to reopen. As a result, the alien has the option either to abide by the terms, and receive the agreed-upon benefits, of voluntary departure; or, alternatively, to forego those benefits and remain in the United States to pursue an administrative motion.” Id. at 2319.
 
In this case, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen for 245(i) adjustment with the Immigration Judge within the voluntary departure period. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on two grounds. First, the respondent’s motion was not supported by evidence showing his prima facie eligibility for 245(i) adjustment “if his I-140 application should ever be approved.” See Immigration Judge’s written decision issued June 30, 2004. Second, the respondent was barred from adjustment of status pursuant to section 240B(d) of the Act, based on his failure to depart as agreed. Because the respondent’s motion to reopen was not denied solely on the 240B(d) bar, Dada does not control this case. To date, regardless of the 240B(d) bar, the respondent has not established his prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status because the respondent has not established he is a grandfathered alien for 245(i) adjustment purposes. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.10. Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion is denied as time and number barred.
 
*3 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s November 9, 2007, decision, denying her unopposed Motion to Rescind Removal Order. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for her failure to appear for the September 21, 2007, hearing. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded.
 
The respondent’s attorney of record admits that he failed to properly note or calendar the hearing. He further accepts complete responsibility for the respondent’s failure to appear for the hearing. Moreover, he has filed a bar complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities detailing his ineffective assistance. The respondent has submitted an affidavit on appeal indicating that her attorney failed to properly record the September 21, 2007, hearing in his calendar.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). In the case at bar, the respondent’s attorney has admitted that the respondent failed to appear at the hearing due to his failure to properly record the hearing date. We find that the respondent has presented a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and the proceedings will be reopened and remanded for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ryan Bausch, Esquire
*1 In a decision dated April 9, 2007, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent abandoned her request to file for the relief of cancellation of removal by failing to file an application by the deadline of March 9, 2007, and the respondent was ordered removed from the United States to Malawi. The respondent subsequently filed a motion to reopen on April 24, 2007, which was denied by the Immigration Judge on May 3, 2007. The respondent has appealed both the Immigration Judge’s initial decision dated April 9, 2007, and the Immigration Judge’s subsequent decision dated May 3, 2007, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen.¿FN1º The respondent requests acceptance of the first appeal by certification. We will accept the respondent’s first appeal by certification to avoid any question of untimeliness. The appeals will be consolidated and the records will be remanded.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred by denying her motion to reopen removal proceedings. She seeks reopening and remand to the Immigration Judge for consideration of newly discovered evidence. The respondent contends that her former attorney, Abdul Abdurahman, failed to file her application for cancellation of removal with the Immigration Court, although she completed the cancellation of removal application with Mr. Abdurahman on March 7, 2007, and she provided him with the application filing fee in January 2007. The respondent has submitted numerous documents in support of her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and in support of her application for cancellation of removal. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Furthermore, her current attorney of record has provided an affidavit concerning his own responsibility in the mishandling of the respondent’s case. The Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995).
 
In light of the respondent’s new allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel concerning her former attorney, Mr. Abdurahman, and the affidavit submitted by her current attorney regarding his responsibility in the mishandling of the respondent’s case, we find that the record must be remanded to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s claim that she failed to timely file her application for cancellation of removal due to ineffective assistance of counsel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). Accordingly, the appeals will be consolidated, and the records will be remanded.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeals are consolidated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The records are remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
 
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 1, 2007, decision. In that decision the Immigration Judge, inter alia, denied the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), as a matter of discretion. The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent to be statutoriJy ineligible for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of facts by an Immigration Judge, including those as to the credibility of testimony, to determine whether the findings are “clearly erroneous.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).¿FN1º The Board may review all questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues on appeal from decisions of the Immigration Judge “de novo.” 8 C.F.R. §1003.1(d)(3)(iii).
 
We first note that, while the respondent, in her Notice of Appeal (EOIR-26), initially raises a possible claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we will not consider this issue, the respondent having neither addressed the issue in her Brief, nor met any of the requirements we laid out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to support such a claim. Turning to the underlying issues, the respondent, who did not dispute any factual findings made by the Immigration Judge, asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her application as a matter of discretion. She asserts that, as she entered the United States in 1983 as a
 
After a determination is made that an alien is removable, and the alien seeks relief from removal which may be granted as a matter of discretion, the Immigration Judge is required to review the record as a whole. See Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581, 585 (BIA 1978). In weighing all of the favorable and adverse factors of record to determine whether cancellation should be granted as a matter of discretion, evidence of a respondent’s bad character or undesirability as a permanent resident of this country may be reviewed with appropriate weight, if any, given to such evidence. See Matter of Sotelo, 23 I&N Dec. 201 (BIA 2001); Matter of Marin, supra. The Immigration Judge met this requirement, considering all of those favorable factors, but nonetheless concluded that the serious adverse factors of record, including the respondent’s criminal activity, outweighed those favorable factors. In weighing the various factors, the Immigration Judge noted that, with respect to two shoplifting convictions, the respondent had demonstrated a complete lack of candor and forthrightness. Specifically, the Immigration Judge found that, while in both her application for cancellation as well as in her testimony on direct examination, she attempted to blame a shoplifting incident on her children, it became clear on cross examination that there were actually two shoplifting incidents, both of which were not only planned by the respondent, but in which she involved her young children. The Immigration Judge also found her immigration violations to be significant, incidents of smuggling aliens into the United States, in 2003 and again in 2004. The Immigration Judge properly considered these serious adverse factors in determining that a favorable exercise of discretion would not be in the best interest of the United States in this instance. We have similarly considered and weighed all of the favorable and adverse factors of record, and agree with the Immigration Judge that relief was not warranted in the exercise of discretion; we therefore affirm the decision for the reasons stated therein. See Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998); Matter of Marin, supra.
 
*2 Turning to the issue of the respondent’s eligibility for voluntary departure, in order to demonstrate statutory eligibility for the privilege of voluntary departure, one of the requirements the alien must meet is to show that he or she has been physically present in the United States for a period of at least 1 year immediately preceding the date the notice to appear was served under section 239(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a). See section 240B(b)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(1)(A).
 
The respondent in the instant case admitted the several allegations set out in the Notice to Appear, issued on December 1, 2003 (Exh. 1; Tr. at 1). She was charged as an arriving alien, and the third allegation was to the effect that on December 1, 2003, she had used the birth certificate of her United States citizen son to assist an alien to try to enter the United States in violation of law. As the respondent has not established that she had been physically present in the United States for a period of at least 1 year immediately preceding the date the notice to appear was issued, she is statutorUy ineligible for voluntary departure. See generally Matter of Romalez, 23 I&N Dec. 423 (BIA 2002); Matter of Arguellas, 22 I&N Dec. 811 (BIA 1999).
 
The following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX9 743 - Guaynabo, PR
August 25, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rosaura Gonzalez Rucci, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rossana Rolon Grau
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen; reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision was dismissed in an order dated May 16, 2008. The respondent filed a motion to “reconsider” on June 13, 2008, which we also construe to be a motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision, and it shall be supported by pertinent authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). A motion to reconsider must assert that, at the time of our previous decision, an error was made. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
Since the respondent has not presented specific alleged errors of law or fact on the part of the Board in its prior order, the motion fails as one for reconsideration.
 
The respondent, through current counsel, argues that former counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. It is maintained that former counsel erred in admitting the respondent’s removability and asserting that he had no available relief from removal, when he “could have requested adjustment of status and a waiver of ¿hisº conviction.”
 
Although the motion to reopen technically is timely, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c), it is not explained why the respondent waited almost 2 years to complain about the quality of representation of former counsel before the Immigration Judge. Present counsel has been representing the respondent since November 13, 2006, the day the appeal was filed, and no mention of any alleged ineffective assistance was lodged on the appeal form or in a multi-page appellate brief filed by present counsel on October 15, 2007. The first allegation of ineffective assistance comes, curiously, only after a final order was rendered in this case.
 
Be that as it may, the respondent has failed to show that the outcome of this case would have been any different, had former counsel’s assistance been any different. An alien alleging ineffective assistance of counsel in proceedings must show that the proceedings were so fundamentally unfair that he or she was prevented from reasonably presenting his or her case. See, e.g., Wang v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 265 (1st Cir. 2004); Saakian v. INS, 252 F.2d 21 (1st Cir. 2001).
 
The record supported the conclusion that the respondent is removable as charged, and the respondent has submitted nothing with his motion to demonstrate otherwise. Further, the respondent has not shown that he is eligible for adjustment of status, a visa petition filed in his favor having been denied by a notice dated October 13, 2006, on the basis that he had engaged in a fraudulent marriage. Consequently, notwithstanding the respondent’s attempt to satisfy the requirements of our holding in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), in the absence of actual prejudice, there is no basis for reopening.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied, as is the request for a stay.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law (withdrawn)

APPLICATION: Review of joint petition to remove conditional status
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.¿FN1º We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s October 26, 2006, decision finding that the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) sustained its burden of establishing that the information in the respondent’s Form I-751 was not true and that the respondent had entered into a marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws. See section 216(c)(3)(D) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(3)(D); 8 C.F.R. § 1216.4(d)(2); see also Matter of Mendes, 20 I&N Dec. 833, 835 (BIA 1994); Matter of Lemhammad, 20 I&N Dec. 316 (BIA 1991). See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(h) (stating that the Board reviews questions of law de novo); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). Nor do we find clear error in the factual findings leading up to that determination. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (mandating that the Board “will accept the determination of factual issues by an immigration judge … unless the determination is clearly erroneous”). Notwithstanding the respondent’s assertions on appeal relating to the reliability of the information contained in the Notice of Termination and its supporting notes, the reliability of such documents was not objected to by respondent’s counsel when it was offered as evidence, although he clearly had an opportunity to do so (Tr. at 57; Exhs. 5, 6). Because we do not have a proper claim of ineffective assistance of counsel before us, we therefore find that the respondent is bound by his attorney’s failure to object to the admission of Exhibits 5 and 6. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986).
 
Moreover, the regulations specifically permit the Immigration Judge to receive in evidence any relevant and material, oral or written, statement previously made by the respondent or any other person during any investigation, examination, hearing, or trial. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.7. Introduction of the District Director’s Notice of Termination is, of course, also appropriate as the Immigration Judge, pursuant to section 216(c)(3)(D) of the Act, was required to “review” such determination. Furthermore, there has been no showing of specific disagreement with the accuracy of the interview as related in Exhibit 5, such as might necessitate an opportunity to cross-examine the interviewer. See, e.g., Baliza v. INS, 709 F.2d 1231 (9th Cir. 1983) (recognizing cross-examination not required where accuracy of affidavit not disputed); Marroquin-Manriquez v. INS, 699 F.2d 129 (3d Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1259 (1984) (recognizing that a respondent’s right to cross-examine witnesses is not absolute; it is circumscribed by the due process concept of reasonableness). The respondent raised no persuasive challenge to the authenticity or accuracy of Exhibits 5 and 6 as record of the interview. Thus, we conclude that admission and use of the notice was not fundamentally unfair. See, e.g., Baliza v. INS, supra;; Matter of Toro, 17 I&N Dec. 340 (BIA 1980); Matter of Ramirez- Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980); Matter of Lam, 141& N Dec. 168 (BIA 1972). Once admitted, the information contained in Exhibits 5 and 6 relating to the interview of the respondent and his spouse was clearly relevant and material. Significantly, as the Immigration Judge noted both the Notice of Termination and the respondent’s testimony reveal the existence of an intimate relationship with the mother of the respondent’s children at the time of the respondent’s initial involvement with and during the respondent’s involvement with his former spouse. We also reject the respondent’s contention that the Immigration Judge impermissibly focused on events that occurred after his marriage. Indeed, although the focus of this inquiry is on the intent of the parties at the time they entered into the marriage, see Matter of McKee, 17 I&N Dec. 332 (BIA 1980), the conduct of the parties after the marriage is relevant to their intent at the time of the marriage. See Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604 (1953). On this record, and on the facts as found by the Immigration Judge, we decline to set aside the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the DHS sustained its burden of establishing that the information in the I-751 was not true and that the respondent had entered into a marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws.
 
*2 Similarly, we find that the respondent’s assertion on appeal that the Immigration Judge improperly imposed his views about marriage onto the respondent is without merit. Under the circumstances, the Immigration Judge properly questioned the authenticity of the respondent’s marriage. Overall, the record reveals that the respondent received a full and fair hearing on the merits of his claim. He was represented by counsel and afforded the opportunity to present, examine, and object to evidence that affected his claim. Although the respondent appears to allege error, he has not on appeal specified such error or articulated or identified prejudice stemming from such errors. More importantly, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that the outcome of his case would have been different had the hearing been conducted in any other manner.
 
Finally, the respondent appeals the denial of voluntary departure. However, the Immigration Judge denied relief as a matter of discretion for the same reasons he relied upon in finding that the respondent had entered into a marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws, and we find no reason to disturb this determination. See Matter of Lemhammad, supra at 326.
 
On the whole, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s resolution. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James T. Jewett, II
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Removability; waiver of inadmissibility
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the May 7, 2008, decision of an Immigration Judge finding him removable as charged and denying his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, argues that he was afforded ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to object to the admission of police reports that differed dramatically from his recollection of events surrounding his two convictions. He also argues that the Immigration Judge failed to consider all of the relevant factors of record in concluding that he did not merit a favorable exercise of discretion. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues that he was afforded ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to object to the admission of police reports that contained dramatically different descriptions of the events when compared to his testimony. We do not find that the admission of the police reports serves as a basis for finding ineffective assistance of counsel inasmuch as the record fails to indicate a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance. Here, the respondent has failed to offer any evidence in support of his claim. We observe that the Immigration Judge did not rely on the police reports to establish the validity of the respondent’s convictions. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41 (admissibility of evidence to establish criminal convictions). Furthermore, we find no basis on which the police reports could have been prevented from being considered for purposes of discretion. The police reports serve as a business record that is probative on the issue of the respondent’s veracity because the description of events contained therein differed dramatically from the description provided by the respondent.
 
We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent does not merit a favorable exercise of discretion for cancellation of removal. We determined in Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998), that the general considerations for the exercise of discretion outlined in Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581 (BIA 1978), were “equally appropriate in considering requests for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act.” Id. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge “must balance the adverse factors evidencing the alien’s undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented … to determine whether the granting of … relief appears in the best interest of this country.” Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. at 584-585. Favorable considerations include such factors as family ties within the United States, residence of long duration in this country, evidence of potential hardship to the applicant or the applicant’s family if relief is not granted, service in the United States armed forces, employment history, business or property ties, evidence of service to the community, proof of rehabilitation if a criminal record exists, and other evidence attesting to good character. See Matter of C-V-T-, supra, at 11; Matter of Marin, supra, at 584-585. Among the factors deemed adverse to the alien are: the seriousness and the nature and circumstances of the removal ground; the presence of additional significant violations of this country’s immigration laws; the existence of a criminal record and its nature, recency, and seriousness; and the presence of other evidence indicative of a respondent’s bad character. Id.
 
*2 With respect to the issue of rehabilitation, a respondent who has a record of criminal misconduct will ordinarily be required to establish rehabilitation before relief will be granted as a matter of discretion. Matter of C-V-T-, supra, at 12, citing Matter of Marin, supra, at 588. However, applications are considered on a case-by-case basis, and rehabilitation is but one factor considered. See Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191, 195-196 (BIA 1990).
 
In this case, we find that the Immigration Judge properly balanced the social and humane considerations of this case against the adverse factors evidencing the respondent’s undesirability as a permanent resident. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent, who is 35 years of age, has resided in the United States since 1999. He has several family members living in the United States, including a United States citizen child, who lives with the child’s grandparents. The respondent has limited employment in the United States, no property, and no assets. His wife is a native and citizen of Nicaragua, living in the United States without legal status.
 
The record also establishes that the Immigration Judge considered the adverse factors of record, including the respondent’s criminal history. The record establishes that the respondent was convicted in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, on January 17, 2006, for the offense of Grand Theft: Money/Labor/Property in violation of California Penal Code 487(a). The respondent was also convicted on October 17, 2006, in the Superior Court of California, County of San Luis Obispo, for the offense of Receiving Property Known to be Stolen in violation of section 496(a) of the California Penal Code.
 
The respondent has failed to establish that he is worthy of a favorable exercise of discretion as it is not in the best interests of the United States for the respondent to remain in this nation. In particular, the recency of the respondent criminal convictions are a very serious negative factor. The respondent’s repeated criminal misconduct reveals a disregard for the laws of this country. Moreover, the recency of the respondent’s convictions precludes finding that he has demonstrated rehabilitation. The respondent’s criminal history represents a very serious negative factor which the respondent’s equities, specifically family ties and length of residence, do not overcome. In considering the respondent’s family ties, the Immigration Judge correctly weighed as a discretionary matter the degree of hardship that would result if the respondent was removed from the United States. In sum, we conclude that the Immigration Judge properly considered all of the relevant evidence relating to the respondent’s equities and the adverse factors of record. The Immigration Judge’s discretionary denial of the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act is affirmed based upon the reasons contained in the Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated December 7, 2007. The respondent contends that his former representative afforded him ineffective assistance of counsel as he failed to contest the merits of the respondent’s denied I-715 petition. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argues that the respondent’s motion fails because the prior attorney made a strategy choice that does not amount to ineffective assistance. Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998).
 
A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). An alien must also show that the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case and that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that alien is prejudiced if attorney’s conduct may have affected the outcome of the proceeding); Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004); Matter of Assaad, supra. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the jurisdiction under which this case arises, has found, however, that aliens need not strictly adhere to the requirements of Matter of Lozada, especially when there is a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” See, e.g., Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
*2 Even if we were to find that the respondent sufficiently complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, we would nonetheless deny the respondent’s motion inasmuch as the respondent has not established prejudice. The respondent has not provided any evidence with the motion which indicates that the outcome of his appeal might have been different had the merits of the I-751 petition been argued. Moreover, the respondent failed to identify substantive arguments that he would have raised before the Immigration Judge regarding the bona fides of his marital relationship. Based upon this lack of proof, we are unable to find that the respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements for proving that he was prejudiced by his former attorney in these proceedings, and reopening is not warranted.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Prince Uche Nwakanma, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Denise Hochul
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on June 30, 1999, because he failed to appear for a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on September 6, 2007, but the Immigration Judge denied it on October 23, 2007. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel and exceptional circumstances therefore prevented him from appearing for the hearing. He indicates that his former counsel, Claude Kleefield, failed to advise him of his hearing or that he was ordered removed from the United States in absentia. The respondent indicates that he learned in 2002 of what had transpired. The respondent further indicates that he attempted to hire attorney Richard Kassel and then Jesus Marcias to seek reopening on his behalf. He asserts that those individuals did not promptly do so. The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge incorrectly determined that he did not seek reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel with due diligence.
 
The Board has the authority to equitably toll the 180-day period to seek reopening if an alien has been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel and seeks reopening based on such with due diligence after becoming aware of the misconduct. See Rashid v. Mukasey, - F.3d -, 2008 WL 2745362 (2nd Cir. July 16, 2008) (stressing an alien’s obligation to seek reopening with due diligence). The respondent was aware in 2002 that he was perhaps the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. It was thus incumbent on him to ensure that his motion to reopen was filed with due diligence. He appears to have waited approximately five years to do so. Such does not constitute due diligence. See Rashid v. Mukasey, supra. The respondent infers that Mr. Kassel and Mr. Marcias may have also been negligent in causing the delay in the filing of the motion. He has not, however, formally accused those individuals of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133 (2nd Cir. 2007) (an alien must substantially comply with the procedural requirements for proving ineffective assistance of counsel). We thus are deprived of an opportunity to consider their rendition of the facts. The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Manuel Nieves, Esquire
*1 This case was last before us on February 19, 2008, at which time we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and to rescind his in absentia deportation order issued on October 15, 1992. The case has now been remanded to us by a May 8, 2008, order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The respondent’s motion will once more be denied.
 
An order of deportation issued in absentia can be rescinded if the respondent files a motion to reopen (i) within 180 days of the order’s issuance and demonstrates that the failure to appear was due to “exceptional circumstances,” or (ii) at any time and demonstrates that he did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with former section 242B(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(a)(2). See former section 242B(c)(3) of the Act.¿FN1º The respondent’s motion sought rescission based upon the claim that ineffective assistance on the part of respondent’s former counsel was the cause for his failure to attend his October 15, 1992, hearing. Citing our decisions in Matter of A-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998), and Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998), we rejected his argument on the ground that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day statutory time limit for the filing of a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia order of deportation based upon exceptional circumstances.
 
The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has remanded the case with instructions that we reexamine that determination in light of Aris v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595 (2d Cir. 2008), issued the day after our February 19, 2008, order, and Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000). In Aris, the court ruled: “We now join our sister circuits in concluding that … a lawyer’s inaccurate advice to his client concerning an immigration hearing date can constitute ‘exceptional circumstances’ excusing the alien’s failure to appear at a deportation hearing … and meriting the reopening of an in absentia deportation order.” Aris v. Mukasey, supra, at 599 (citations omitted). Citing Iavorski v. INS, supra, at 134, the court added in a footnote: “The deadline for moving to reopen may be equitably tolled until the ineffective assistance of counsel ‘is, or should have been, discovered by a reasonable person in the situation.”’ See Aris v. Mukasey, supra at 599 n.7. In light of this decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, we vacate that portion of our February 19, 2008, order that denied the respondent’s motion on the ground that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day statutory time limit for the filing of a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia order of deportation based upon exceptional circumstances.¿FN2º
 
*2 We will again deny the respondent’s Second Motion to Reopen, for “no matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled.” Celtic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing Iavorski v. INS, supra, at 129). The court explained:
In a situation where ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from having the opportunity to present his case for relief, the filing deadline for motions to reopen will be equitably tolled until the ineffective assistance “is, or should have been, discovered by a reasonable person in the situation.” From the point at which the ineffective assistance of counsel should have been, or was in fact, discovered, “an alien must demonstrate … that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll.” Furthermore, the parties seeking such tolling bear the burden of proving that they were in fact diligent.
 
Id. at 171 (quoting Iavorski v. INS, supra, at 134, 135). The respondent’s motion does not meet that burden.
 
The respondent’s affidavit, submitted in support of his Second Motion to Reopen, states only that (1) his first attorney twice met with him after his first hearing and told the respondent that “he would take care of everything” and get him a “green card;” (2) this attorney failed to inform the respondent of the hearing at which he was ordered deported in absentia; (3) after learning of his attorney’s death, the respondent went to his office where he was told he would have to secure new counsel; (4) he “then got another lawyer” whose “first name was Frank;” (5) he met with and was billed by this attorney on several occasions; (6) the attorney told him he could get the respondent a “green card;” (7) he went to this attorney’s office “three weeks later,” only to learn that he too had died; (8) the respondent “didn’t know what to do” but he did consult “another lawyer” who told the respondent that if he had been granted a “green card,” as “Frank” had said, the respondent “would still be on record as having a green card;” and (9) this information made the respondent feel better and so he thereafter told “people” that he had a “green card.” See Second Motion to Reopen at Exh. A-1. The respondent’s affidavit provides no specific information as to the timing of these various events, an omission fatal to his burden of proof in light of the nearly 15 years that passed between the issuance of the in absentia order and the filing of his first motion. Nor does the affidavit provide the identities of the attorneys he claims to have consulted. Finally, the affidavit fails to state whether the respondent made enquiries of the third attorney or of the government, at any point over the years, about how to get a replacement “green card,” an effort that would be natural in light of what he claims he had been told and which would have revealed to the respondent the misinformation and prior ineffective assistance he had received.
 
*3 We therefore find that the respondent has failed to demonstrate that he exercised due diligence, throughout the period he seeks to toll, in discovering and seeking redress from the ineffective assistance of counsel that he has alleged. See Cekic v. INS, supra. Accordingly, we find no basis for equitable tolling of the 180-day statutory filing period for a motion seeking rescission of the respondent’s in absentia deportation order based upon a claim that exceptional circumstances are to blame for his failure to attend his missed hearing. See Aris v. Mukasey, supra at 599 n.7; section 242B(a)(2)of the Act.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s Second Motion to Reopen is denied.

Contrary to the assertion in the respondent’s Second Motion to Reopen filed with the Board on January 9, 2008, a motion to reopen deportation proceedings is governed by §242B(c) of the Act, where service of the notice of a hearing at which the respondent failed to appear occurred after June 13, 1992, but prior to April 1, 1997. See Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644, 646 (BIA 1993). The notice of hearing in this case was issued July 16, 1992 (Exh. 3).

Susan E. Hill, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lily C. Hsu
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was previously before us on December 21, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 30, 2007. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the in absentia order of removal entered on March 22, 2006, based on alleged “exceptional circumstances”on account of which the respondent claimed he failed to appear at the hearing held on March 22, 2006. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (2008). The respondent presently moves the Board to reconsider our initial decision pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). However, the respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.
 
Our decision dated December 21, 2007, was based in part upon the respondent’s failure to comply with the procedural prerequisites for a motion to reopen under a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Specifically, the respondent failed to support his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with any evidence showing that the individual accused of having provided ineffective legal assistance has been informed of the allegations against him. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592. 598-99 (9th Cir. 2004) (recognizing that purpose of the notice requirement is to allow prior counsel an opportunity to contest allegations of ineffectiveness so that the adjudicator can accurately assess the claim). In an effort to cure this defect, the respondent has included a declaration from the attorney who allegedly prepared and mailed the complaint to the individual accused of having provided ineffective legal assistance with the instant motion to reconsider.
 
However, the purpose of a motion to reopen is to state new facts to be proven at a prospective hearing date based on previously unavailable or undiscoverable evidence that indicates a meritorious claim for relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); Iturribarria v. IXS, 321 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir. 2003). A motion to reconsider, on the other hand, is intended to serve the separate purpose of providing the respondent with a procedural mechanism for “specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). That is, a motion to reopen provides a means for the introduction of new. relevant, and previously unavailable evidence into the record of proceeding, whereas a motion to reconsider is essentially just a request for further review of the record of proceeding in light of the factual and legal errors raised in the motion. Although the respondent has stylized the motion as a motion to reconsider, it is in substance a motion to reopen seeking consideration of new evidence, i.e., the declaration from the attorney who allegedly prepared and mailed the complaint to the individual accused of having provided ineffective legal assistance. Inasmuch, therefore, as the motion to reconsider fails to specify any errors of fact or law in our decision dated December 21, 2007, the motion to reconsider is denied on this basis. If we were to construe the motion as a motion to reopen, the motion would be denied on the grounds that: (1) the motion is numerically barred because the respondent may only file one motion to reopen after the Final administrative decision entered on March 22, 2006; and (2) the evidence offered was previously available to the respondent when he filed the motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge on December 4, 2006. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gary J. Yerman, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of China, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s April 3, 2007, decision denying her motion to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4) (2008). The appeal is dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent advances two principal arguments. First, the respondent contends that she has established “extraordinary circumstances” warranting equitable tolling of the time and numeric limitations on motions to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal in that she has filed a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against her former attorney (Respondent’s Br. at 5-7). See generally, Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Second, the respondent argues that she has established “changed country conditions arising in the country … to which removal has been ordered,” thereby excepting the motion to reopen from the time and numeric limitations to which such motions are customarily subject (Respondent’s Br. at 7-9). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i).
 
A motion to reopen filed in Immigration Court must generally be filed within 90 days of the entry of a final administrative order of removal, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), and the motion will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied that the evidence offered in the motion is material and not previously available or discoverable at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). A motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia order of removal based on “extraordinary circumstanced” must be filed within 180 days of the entry of the final administrative order. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). In addition, a motion to reopen filed for the purpose of submitting an application for asylum and related relief may be excepted from the time and numeric limitations if the motion establishes “changed country conditions arising in the country … to which removal has been ordered.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i).
 
In this case, the in absentia order of removal was entered against the respondent on September 10, 1999 (I.J. at 1 (April 3, 2007)). The respondent filed her first motion to reopen on January 24, 2000. The Immigration Judge denied that motion, and the Immigration Judge’s decision became a final administrative decision after the appeal period elapsed on February 23, 2000 (I.J. at 1-2 (April 3, 2007)). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39. The respondent subsequently filed a second motion to reopen on May 22, 2006 in which she advanced allegations substantially similar to those presently before us on appeal of ineffective assistance of counsel and of “changed country conditions” in China based on the alleged intensification of the enforcement of China’s coercive population control program. However, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s second motion to reopen on June 1, 2006, and, once again, that decision became a final administrative decision after the appeal period elapsed on July 1, 2006 (I.J. at 2 (April 3, 2007)). The respondent does not dispute that the present motion to reopen, filed on January 9, 2007, the third that she has filed, is subject to the time and numeric restrictions on motions to reopen.
 
*2 Turning first to the respondent’s claim that both the time and numeric limitations to which motions to reopen are subject should be tolled on account of the ineffectiveness of her former attorney, we disagree. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has recognized, the 180-day filing deadline for motions to reopen an in absentia order of removal is not subject to equitable tolling, under a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel or otherwise. See Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 1999) (“The ¿180-day filing periodº provision is jurisdictional and mandatory.”); see also Abdi v. Attorney General of the United States, 430 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir. 2005).
 
With respect to the respondent’s remaining claim of “changed country conditions arising in the country … to which removal has been ordered,” we note that the respondent’s claim is principally based on her decision to remain in the United States and give birth to several children after she had been ordered removed (Respondent’s M.T.R. (Exh. A) (Jan. 9, 2007)). However, we do not find that this constitutes a justifiable exception to the regulatory restrictions on motions to reopen in light of China’s coercive population control program. The birth of a second child constitutes changed personal circumstances, not “changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i); see also Zheng v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 869, 872 (8th Cir. 2007); Chen v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 758, 760-61 (7th Cir. 2007); Wang v. BIA, 437 F.3d 270, 273-74 (2d Cir. 2006); Zheng v. United States Department of Justice, 416 F.3d 129, 130 (2d Cir. 2005); Matter of C-W-L-, 24 I&N Dec. 346 (BIA 2007). Finally, we agree with the Immigration Judge for the reasons provided in his April 3, 2007, decision that the country conditions evidence submitted by the respondent failed to establish that conditions with respect to China’s coercive population control program have, in fact, changed (I.J. at 3-4 (April 3, 2007)). See generally, Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247 (BIA 2007); Matter of C-C-, 23 I&N Dec. 899 (BIA 2006). Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Keli M. Reynolds, Esquire
*1 This case was last before us on November 23, 1999, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge June 28, 1999, decision finding him removable as an aggravated felon. The respondent has now filed an untimely motion to reopen on June 24, 2008. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the pending motion, which will be granted upon our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997)(Board will exercise its sua sponte authority over an untimely motion only in an “exceptional situation”); Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373 (A.G. 2002); Ekimian v. INS, 303 F.3d 1153, 1156-60 (9th Cir. 2002) (acknowledging Board’s authority to reopen sua sponte is within its unfettered discretion).
 
The respondent argues that subsequent to the Immigration Judge’s November 23, 1999, decision, finding the respondent removable as charged, the conviction underlying the charge of removal was modified by the Superior Court of West District Judicial District, County of Los Angeles, California, pursuant to a writ of error coram nobis alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.¿FN1º The respondent further argues that because the Court re-sentenced him to 364 days imprisonment, the conviction no longer meets the definition of an aggravated felony theft under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act.
 
In order to qualify as an aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act, the sentence imposed for a theft offense must be for imprisonment for at least one year. The new sentence imposed for the respondent’s 1998 theft conviction is now less than one year. While it is unclear from the record why the criminal court modified the respondent’s sentence, the Board has determined in Matter of Cota-Vargas, 23 I&N Dec. 849 (BIA 2005), that a trial court’s decision to modify or reduce an alien’s criminal sentence nunc pro tunc is entitled to full faith and credit by the Immigration Judges and the Board of Immigration Appeals, and such a modified or reduced sentence is recognized as valid for purposes of the immigration law without regard to the trial court’s reasons for effecting the modification or reduction. Matter of Song, 23 I&N Dec. 173 (BIA 2001), clarified; Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003), distinguished.
 
Consequently, the record will be remanded to enable the Immigration Judge to consider the modification of the respondent’s sentence for his 1998 California theft conviction in light of our decision in Matter of Cota-Vargas, supra, as it affects his removability for an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act, and to ascertain whether there presently remain grounds for removal. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and the entry of a new decision.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. On December 8, 1995, the Immigration Judge denied his application for a waiver under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), because he failed to pay the filing fee as ordered. A document submitted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) shows that the respondent was deported on July 20, 2006. On September 26, 2006, he then submitted a proposed joint motion to reopen with the DHS and filed a courtesy copy of the same motion with the Immigration Court (I.J. at 1). The Immigration Judge mistakenly construed the courtesy copy as a joint motion to reopen, and ordered the proceedings reopened sua sponte on October 11, 2006 (I.J. at 1). On October 13, 2006, the respondent’s counsel filed a statement clarifying that the proposed motion was merely a courtesy copy for the Immigration Court (I.J. at 2). In turn, on January 3, 2007, the DHS filed a motion to vacate the October 11, 2006, order, asserting its lack of consent to reopening and notifying the Immigration Judge for the first time of the respondent’s July 20, 2006, deportation. Presently before the Board is the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s February 20, 2007, decision vacating the prior order. The appeal is dismissed.
 
A motion to reopen must ordinarily be filed within 90 days after the entry of a final administrative order of deportation, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Thus, the respondent has not filed a timely motion. Moreover, he does not argue that an exception to the time bar applies, claiming instead that the proceedings should be reopened sua sponte because his former attorney provided him ineffective assistance of counsel. We disagree. The respondent displayed a lack of due diligence by failing to raise this claim until after his deportation, over a decade after the purported ineffective representation occurred in 1995. Therefore, he cannot establish exceptional circumstances warranting sua sponte reopening. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992) (motions to reopen are especially disfavored in immigration proceedings because every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (Board’s discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Virginia Carstens, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated July 24, 2007, dismissing the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision which found him removable and denied his application for adjustment of status. The respondent’s motion seeks to reopen for adjustment of status (based on an approved visa petition on his behalf by his United States citizen daughter) because of the alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel (Kevin Dehghani). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be granted because the respondent meets the requirements to allege ineffective assistance of counsel, shows prejudice, and shows due diligence so that equitable tolling of the time limitation on motions to reopen is warranted.
 
The facts and pertinent history of the case are as follows. The Immigration Judge issued his decision on January 27, 2006. The respondent appealed. The Board issued its decision on July 24, 2007. The respondent filed the present motion on March 19, 2008.
 
We find that the respondent meets the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA. 1988), to allege ineffective assistance of Mr. Dehghani. The respondent presents his affidavit;, present counsel’s letter to Mr. Dehghani, which gave him an opportunity to respond, and a complaint filed with the statewide bar counsel in East Hartford, Connecticut.
 
The Board held in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 561 (BIA 2003), that even if an alien meets the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, he or she must still show sufficient prejudice stemming from prior counsel’s actions. We find that the respondent shows sufficient prejudice. The respondent presents in support of his motion voluminous documentation to show the bona fides of his second marriage, which was at issue at the January 27, 2006, hearing. The respondent, through Mr. Dehghani, presented very little evidence regarding the marriage bona fides. Clearly the evidence now presented may have changed the outcome of the case.
 
The respondent also shows prejudice as regards the ground of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(6)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii) ¿falsely claiming United States citizenshipº. The respondent admitted using a false Puerto Rican identification card (Exh. 6), which stated that he was a United States citizen, to obtain a job. The respondent testified about this at the January 27, 2006, hearing, but the date the misrepresentation occurred was not brought up. See Tr. at 22-23, 26, 42-43. The respondent states in his affidavit that the misrepresentation occurred in 1994.¿FN1º This ground of inadmissibility (added by IIRIRA) only applies to representations made on or after September 30, 1996. The respondent thus makes a prima facie showing that the timing of the misrepresentation may have a bearing on the outcome of the case.
 
*2 We find that the respondent exercised due diligence in filing his motion to reopen. The Board issued its decision on July 24, 2007. The respondent met with and retained present counsel on August 13, 2007. The motion to reopen was filed on March 19, 2008, Ninety days from August 13, 2007 (when the respondent discovered that Mr. Dehghani provided ineffective assistance), was November 13, 2007. The period the respondent is asking us to toll runs from November 13, 2007, until March 19, 2008, which is 4 months and 1 week. We find that it is appropriate to equitably toll this time period. The respondent retained present counsel less than 3 weeks after the issuance of our July 24, 2007, decision. Although 4 months and I week is over the 90-day time limit for filing a motion to reopen, it is not excessively so given the actions which needed to be taken, including complying with the Lozada requirements and locating the documents the respondent presents which support the bona fides of his second marriage. See Jin Bo Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154, 159 (2d Cir. 2006) (finding that under the facts in the case, the motions period could be tolled for 5 months).
 
Accordingly, the motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jerry A. Beatmann
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This case was last before this Board on April 16, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s January 17, 2008, decision. In our decision, we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). On June 19, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider and reopen our decision. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the respondent’s motion to reopen and reconsider. The respondent filed a response to the DHS’s opposition.¿FN1º The motion to reopen and reconsider will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider a decision must be filed with the Board within 30 days after the mailing of our decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The record indicates that on May 9, 2008, the respondent requested that we reissue our April 16, 2008, decision. The record also indicates that the respondent attempted to file a motion to reissue our decision on June 9, 2008, but that the motion was rejected for failure to include the required fee or fee waiver request form. On June 19, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and reconsider and requested that we reissue our decision alleging that he had not received a copy of it. The respondent has submitted a copy of an envelope sent by the Office of the Clerk of the Board of Immigration Appeals. The envelope indicates that it was returned to the sender. Inasmuch as it appears that the respondent did not receive a copy of our decision, another copy of our April 16, 2008, decision will be sent to the respondent and we will deem his motion to be timely filed.¿FN2º
 
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1), a motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority. The respondent claims that we lodged an additional charge of removability against him in our decision. We disagree. Our prior order merely reflects that an additional charge of removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), was lodged against the respondent during proceedings (Exh. 1A). The record indicates that the Immigration Judge did not find him removable on this basis and our order did not disturb that finding (Exh. 1A; Tr. at 20).
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he failed to establish extreme hardship to his United States citizen spouse or children. Our prior decision did not address the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he failed to establish extreme hardship to his wife or children because we found no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not merit relief as a matter of discretion. The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge and this Board erred in looking at his entire indictment, which included counts that were dismissed, to find that the respondent did not merit relief as a matter of discretion. We find no legal error in this examination for purposes of a discretionary determination and no legal error in the determination that the respondent does not merit relief as a matter of discretion.
 
*2 The respondent also requests that we reopen proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel. A motion to reopen must state the new facts to be proved and must be supported by evidentiary material. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). We have held that an alien must meet the “heavy burden” of showing that “if proceedings before the immigration judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence offered would likely change the result in the case.” Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992); see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 110 (1988) (stating that a motion to reopen is analogous to a motion for a new trial in a criminal case on the basis of newly discovered evidence and that the movant therefore faces a “heavy burden”). We note that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639, we held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the claim reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel also requires that the respondent establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his counsel’s ineffectiveness. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640.
 
The respondent contends that his prior attorney erred in failing to have him apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(b). However, inasmuch as the respondent conceded before the Immigration Judge that he was removable as charged under section 23 7(a)(2)(A)(ii)of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), the respondent is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act. See I.J. at 13; section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act (barring aliens convicted of an offense under section 237(a)(2) of the Act from eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act). Furthermore, a copy of a letter from the Alabama State Bar dated June 4, 2008, which the respondent submitted with his motion, provides that two attorneys from the Office of General Counsel of the Alabama State Bar reviewed the respondent’s complaint against his attorney and the attorney’s response. The letter explains that “in view of the nature and content of the complaint and the … response of the attorney¿,º” the Alabama State Bar decided to “take no further action in ¿theº matter.” The respondent also claims that evidence attached to his motion was not investigated by his prior counsel. However, the respondent has not made a prima facie showing that he suffered prejudice as a result of the failure to submit these documents. Based on the foregoing, we find that the respondent has not made a prima facie showing of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Matter of Coelho, supra. Based on the foregoing, we will deny the respondent’s request for reopening.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: A copy of the Board’s April 16, 2008, decision in this case will be reissued to the respondent.

The respondent contends that we should not consider the DHS’s response to his motion because it was filed more than 10 days after his motion. The regulations provide that opposing parties haver 13 days from the date of service of the motion to file a brief in opposition to a motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The regulations also provide that we may, in our discretion, consider a brief filed out of time. See id. We will do so in the instant case.

APPLICATION: Reconsideration; removability
 
The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider our decision dated May 22, 2008, in which we summarily dismissed his untimely appeal from an Immigration Judge’s March 19, 2008, decision. The Board will grant the motion to reconsider, vacate our prior order, and exercise jurisdiction over the respondent’s appeal by certification. Upon consideration of the merits of the appeal, however, we will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
In our May 22, 2008, decision we noted that the Immigration Judge’s decision was mailed on March 19, 2008, the appeal was due at the Board on or before April 18, 2008, and the Notice of Appeal was filed on April 21, 2008. In this motion, the respondent acknowledges that the Notice of Appeal was filed in an untimely manner. He asserts, however, that the delay in filing was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent claims that his former attorney, who reserved appeal on his behalf, was aware of his intention to appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision. Furthermore, he claims that he was confident that his attorney would file the appeal because when he attempted to hand her the Notice of Appeal forms, she informed him that she such forms in her office. Finally, he claims that when he contacted the attorney on April 17, 2008, she informed him that she did not file an appeal on his behalf.
 
To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must establish prejudice as well as substantial compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Iturribarria v. I.N.S., 321 F.3d 889, 899-900 (9th Cir. 2003). In this case, we find evidence of substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements. In light of the respondent’s claims, we also find that the respondent reasonably demonstrated to his attorney that he was interested in appealing the Immigration Judge’s decision. See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470(2000). Furthermore, in light of the respondent’s prompt submission of the Notice of Appeal within days of the deadline, we find that but for the attorney’s failure to file the appeal, the respondent would have filed an appeal in a timely manner. Id. In sum, the respondent has established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to his former attorney’s handling of the appeal.
 
*2 A motion to reconsider may be based on an allegation of material factual errors in the prior decision. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). In this case, although the respondent asserted in the Notice of Appeal that the attorney failed to file the appeal on his behalf, we did not consider the issue in reaching our decision to summarily dismiss the appeal. Inasmuch as we did not consider the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim in reaching our previous decision, we will vacate our prior order and accept jurisdiction over the appeal by certification. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c). Upon consideration of the merits of the appeal, however, we will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
During the removal hearings, the respondent, through counsel, conceded removability and applied for no forms of relief. Instead, he moved to continue the proceedings until after April 14, 2008, to enable him to pursue a collateral attack on the criminal conviction underlying the charges of removability. The Immigration Judge denied the continuance and ordered the respondent removable to Belize.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the crime for which his was convicted is not an aggravated felony, and that he is not removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).¿FN1º We disagree.
 
The respondent does not dispute that on January 13, 2006, he was convicted in the California Superior Court,County of San Bernardino, for the offense of possession or purchase of cocaine base in violation of section 11351.5 of the California Health and Safety Code. According to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this proceeding arises, a state drug offense qualifies as an aggravated felony for immigration purposes only if it would be punishable as a felony under federal drug laws, or if it contains a trafficking element. See Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, 382 F.3d 905, 910-(9th Cir. 2004). An offense is classified as a felony under the federal drug laws if it is punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding 1 year See 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(5); 21 U.S.C. § 802(44). The respondent’s offense, involving the possession of cocaine base for sale, is equivalent to the federal offense of possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Possession of less than 5 grams of cocaine base with intent to distribute is punishable under federal law by a term of imprisonment of up to 20 years, making it a federal felony. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C). Because the respondent’s offense is punishable as a felony under the federal drug laws, it qualifies as an aggravated felony in the Ninth Circuit. The respondent is, therefore, removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
*3 The following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s May 22, 2008, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrea Ferrara, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathan Goulding
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on September 15, 1999. She filed a motion to reopen on September 12, 2007, but the Immigration Judge denied it on November 13, 2007. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that she filed a timely motion to reopen. We disagree. The respondent does not dispute that she received the Notice of Hearing. She indicates in her affidavit that she appeared slightly late for her hearing and hired an attorney to seek reopening of these proceedings. She indicates that she learned on March 29, 2005, that her motion to reopen was not filed. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent was required to have filed a motion to reopen based ineffective assistance of counsel. The Board would then perhaps have had an opportunity to consider the rendition of the facts as recalled by the respondent’s former counsel. We will not presume that the respondent’s former counsel was negligent in the absence of proof that the respondent complied with the procedural requirements for proving such. See Pepaj v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 725 (6th Cir. 2007). We further agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to seek reopening with due diligence. See Dunlap v. United States, 250 F.3d 1001, 1008 (6th Cir. 2001). The respondent was aware on March 29, 2005, that her former counsel had allegedly failed to seek reopening of these proceedings. It was thus incumbent on her to seek reopening with due diligence. Her failure to do so for more than two years is indicative of her lack of diligence exercised in this matter. Reopening is inappropriate.
 
The respondent further argues that these proceedings should be reopened based on changed conditions or circumstances in Honduras. See Matter of A-N- & R-M-N-, 22 I&N Dec. 953 (BIA 1999). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to establish a reasonable likelihood that she would prevail at a hearing based on such. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert West, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julia C. Chimarusti
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated March 16, 2001. In that decision we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision concluding he was removable as charged and ineligible for any relief from removal, including cancellation of removal and a waiver under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C §1182(c). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.¿FN1º
 
As an initial matter, we address the question of our jurisdiction over the respondent’s motion. The respondent was deported from the United States on or about March 5, 2003, and illegally reentered on or about August 1, 2003. See Respondent’s Motion at 3.¿FN2º The respondent filed the present motion on February 5, 2008. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Reynoso-Cisneros v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1001 (holding that because the alien departed the United States after the completion of immigration proceedings, the Board had jurisdiction over the alien’s motion to reopen); see also Lin v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 979, 982 (9th Cir. 2007).¿FN3º
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent requests equitable tolling based on his claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel (Richard Fraade).¿FN4º See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating that the court recognizes equitable tolling of deadlines and numerical limits on motions to reopen or reconsider during periods when an alien is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and upheld in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). We conclude that equitable tolling is not warranted.
 
We find that the respondent has not substantially complied with the procedural prerequisites for alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent presents a copy of the bar complaint filed against Mr. Fraade which included an affidavit swearing to the contents of his complaint. Even if the affidavit can be construed as a separate declaration, there is no evidence that the respondent has notified Mr. Fraade of the allegations against him before the Board, and likewise no proof that he has been given an opportunity to respond to the allegations made against him to the Board. The respondent asserts that he has submitted emails to Mr. Fraade in this regard, but no such evidence has been submitted with the motion. See Respondent’s Motion at 6. Further, this is not a case where patent ineffective assistance has been shown which would excuse insufficient compliance with Lozada. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002). Therefore, based on insufficient compliance with Lozada, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not considered by the Board, and shall not be considered as a basis to toll the filing deadline for his motion. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 Assuming arguendo substantial compliance with Lozada, we conclude that the respondent does not show ineffective assistance of Mr. Fraade, and thus, does not show prejudice. See Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1046 (9th Cir. 2000) (stating that to show prejudice, the alien only need show plausible grounds for relief). The respondent claims that his former counsel failed to aggressively argue against the removal charge and to present a claim for cancellation of removal.
 
However, under the law as developed at the time of the Immigration Judge’s and Board’s decisions, the respondent’s conviction under Cal. Health & Safety Code § 11360(a) rendered him removable as charged under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º, to wit, an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B).¿FN5º See United States v. Lara-Aceves, 183 F.3d 1007 (9th Cir. 1999), United States v. Estrada-Torres, 179 F.3d 776 (9th Cir. 1999), and United States v. Lomas, 30 F.3d 1191 (9th Cir. 1994). These cases were collectively overruled on April 18, 2001, by United v. Rivera-Sanchez, 247 F.3d 905 (9th Cir. 2001), superseded by statute on other grounds (holding that § 11360(a) was facially too broad to be considered an aggravated felony in a Sentencing Guidelines context). Thus, that decision was issued after the final administrative order of removal was issued here. The respondent incorrectly asserts in his motion that “the Ninth Circuit had ruled on this issue prior to ¿hisº removal hearing.”. See Respondent’s Motion at 7. Thus, based on the applicable law as developed at the time the Board issued its March 16, 2001, decision, the respondent’s conviction qualified as an aggravated felony, which also rendered him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1229b(a)(3).¿FN6º As a result, his prior counsel’s assistance was not ineffective by failing to aggressively argue against the removal charge and for cancellation of removal.
 
We also find that the respondent does not show due diligence. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra, at 897 (stating that the alien must act with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). As noted above, United States v. Rivera-Sanchez was issued shortly after the Board’s dismissal of his appeal. The respondent does not explain the 7-year delay until February of 2008, to raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, e.g., based on failure to file a motion based on the change in law. Thus, the respondent has not shown due diligence in bringing his ineffective assistance claim.
 
*3 Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied as untimely, and the respondent has not established a basis for equitable tolling of the filing deadline.
 
The respondent argues in the alternative that the Board should exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen the proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999) (fundamental change in law may warrant sua sponte reopening notwithstanding otherwise applicable time and number limitations on motions); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (Board will exercise its sua sponte authority over an untimely motion only in an “exceptional situation”). The Board declines to sua sponte reopen these proceedings.
 
The respondent’s arguments in favor of sua sponte reopening are not clear, as he cites to the “Corona Rivera decision” with no citation, as a fundamental change in law. See Respondent’s “Reply to ICE Opposition.” We surmise that the respondent intended to cite to United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, supra. The change in law represented by Rivera-Sanchez predates the respondent’s motion by nearly 7 years. The respondent has not shown due diligence by promptly seeking reopening based on that change in law. Consequently, the interest of finality in immigration proceedings takes precedence. See, e.g., Matter of G-C-L-, 23 I&N Dec. 359 (BIA 2002) (setting forth reasons for no longer sua sponte reopening cases where more than 5 years had passed from a fundamental change in law). Further, the respondent has offered no evidence establishing that his conviction was not for an aggravated felony. Although the burden is on the DHS to establish an alien’s removal under section 237 of the Act, as an alien seeking sua sponte reopening, we find it appropriate to place the burden on the respondent to submit evidence establishing that his conviction involved conduct which would not qualify as an aggravated felony. The respondent has not submitted such evidence. Thus, as an exceptional situation has not been shown, the Board finds insufficient cause to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

Footnotes

1

The respondent submitted with his motion a copy of a court document purportedly dismissing an indictment against him for illegal reentry after deportation. The basis for the dismissal claims that there may have been “a possible legal problem with the defendant’s removal proceedings.” Contrary to the respondent’s assertions in his motion, he has submitted no evidence that any court has found a legal error in his removal proceedings.

2

The respondent appears to state that he was removed a second time, and perhaps reentered again subsequently; however, the record is not clear and the DHS has not submitted any evidence in this regard. See Respondent’s Motion at 4.

3

The DHS has not informed the Board whether it has reinstated a prior removal order pursuant to section 241(a)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5), and 8 C.F.R. § 241.8. See Lin v. Gonzales, supra, at 982.

4

The respondent also claims ineffective assistance of William C. Carrico, Assistant Federal Public Defender. This claim is not properly before the Board as the respondent has not shown that Mr. Carrico represented him before the Immigration Judge or the Board.

5

The respondent incorrectly asserts that he was also found removable “as an alien convicted of a narcotics offense ….” Respondent’s Motion at 2. It is noted that the DHS repeated the same incorrect information in its opposition. The single removal charge was under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act (Exh. 1).

6

As affirmed in the Board’s March 16, 2001, decision, the respondent was also ineligible for a waiver under section 212(c), and no change in law affects this determination.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Termination
 
This case was last before us on March 6, 2008, when we vacated the Immigration Judge’s November 6, 2007, decision and granted the respondent’s motion to remand, in which he asserted that his criminal trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in conceding his removability before the Immigration Judge on November 6, 2007.
 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) now appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 11, 2008, decision on remand granting the respondent’s motion to terminate the aggravated felony ground of removal pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The DHS contends that it has met its burden of establishing that the respondent’s bank fraud conviction involved a loss to a victim or victims exceeding $ 10,000.00, and therefore is an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(M) of the Act. The respondent, a native and citizen of Guyana, moves for affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision.¿FN1º The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge was correct in the April 11, 2008, decision, which found that the evidence of record fell short of the “clear and convincing standard” set forth in section 240(c)(3)(A) to establish the amount of loss resulting from his federal fraud conviction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1344, as opposed to the theft conviction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 641. The Immigration Judge also found that the record did not reveal how the trial judge arrived at the $23,450.21 restitution total, as reflected in the criminal judgment. The DHS’s appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded for a new decision consistent with our findings below.
 
We find that the evidence submitted by the DHS supports a finding that the “loss to the victim” and the restitution amount in this case are attributable to the respondent’s conviction under Count I (Bank Fraud - 18 U.S.C. § 1344). See Nijhawan v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 523 F.3d 387, 399 (3d Cir. 2008)¿FN2º (it is well within the competence of a court to examine the record for clear and convincing evidence of loss caused by the conduct of conviction); see Matter of Babaisakov, 24 I&N Dec. 306 (BIA 2007). The original January 10, 2003, complaint was filed against the respondent by a Postal Inspector. It charged that the combined total of 42 fraudulent checks deposited in the Fleet Bank account opened by the respondent was approximately $33,425.36. The criminal docket for the respondent’s case in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, dated February 11, 2004, reflects that a jury found the respondent guilty of Counts 1 and 2. The respondent’s pre-sentence investigation report (PSI), submitted on his May 14, 2004, sentencing date, confirms that the jury found the respondent guilty of Count 1, Bank Fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1344, and Count 2, Theft of Government Property under 18 U.S.C. § 641. The PSI reveals that the defendant fraudulently deposited stolen checks totaling $37,080.21 into his Fleet Bank account (PSI at 5, item 21).
 
*2 The PSI further shows that as a result of the fraudulent checks that cleared, Fleet Bank, the victim of this offense, suffered losses of $23,450.21 (PSI at 4, item 15). The PSI recommends that full restitution to the victim is required under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A and 18 U.S.C. § 3664, and that restitution in the amount of $23,450.21 is owed to Fleet Bank (PSI at 10, item 59). The trial judge ordered that the respondent pay restitution in the amount recommended in the PSI. We find that this document clearly reveals how the trial judge arrived at the $23,450.21 restitution total, and that it alleges a specific monetary loss related to the respondent’s fraud conviction.
 
We conclude that, taken together, the complaint filed against the respondent, the criminal docket documenting the judgment of conviction, and the PSI with the restitution order, establish that the requisite loss was tied to the respondent’s conviction of bank fraud. See Nijhawan v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 395. We also conclude that a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1344 is clearly a “fraud” offense. Id. at 390-91. As Fleet Bank was the “victim” of this fraud offense, and the amount of its loss exceeded $ 10,000.00, we find that the DHS has met its burden of establishing that the respondent was convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43(M).
 
Finally, even though the respondent was found guilty by a jury and not by a plea agreement, we disagree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the PSI did not reflect that the respondent agreed to the alleged loss, or that he was given an opportunity to object to the amount. In Nijhawan, as in the case, the respondent was found guilty of fraud by a jury. In its decision, the Third Circuit held that the language of section 101(a)(43)(M)(i) of the Act does not require a jury to have determined that there was a loss in excess of $ 10,000.00. Nijhawan v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 391. The Third Circuit further held that “the amount of loss in a restitution order, which by its nature is neither found by a jury nor specifically pled to by a defendant, could be considered.” Id. at 394. Therefore, as applied to this case, the fact that the respondent was found guilty by a jury does not prevent the Immigration Judge’s consideration of the alleged loss set forth in the PSI and relied upon by the criminal trial judge.
 
Accordingly, we find that the Immigration Judge erred in terminating proceedings. The evidence submitted by the DHS establishes that the respondent was convicted of a fraud offense, Fleet Bank was the victim of that loss, and the amount of that loss was in excess of $10,000.00.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal of the Department of Homeland Security is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings not inconsistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

Although the heading of the respondent’s appellate brief, received on June 26, 2008, incorrectly indicates that he filed it in support of his appeal of the adverse decision of the Immigration Judge, we will accept it as a brief in opposition to the DHS’s appeal.

We note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued its decision in Nijhawan v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, in May 2008, subsequent to the Immigration Judge’s April 11, 2008, decision.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Theodore N. Cox, Esquire
*1 This case was last before us on April 6, 2004, at which time we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s January 2, 2003, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his deportation proceedings due to (1) the respondent’s failure to show that he did not receive notice of the Immigration Court hearing at which he was ordered deported in absentia; and (2) the respondent’s failure to file a timely motion to reopen for the purpose of applying for asylum. In an order dated March 24, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that we and the Immigration Judge had abused our discretion in denying the respondent’s motion to reopen “because, regardless of whether Chou received proper oral notice of his 1993 hearing, the bar to relief under former 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(e)(1) does not apply to asylum claims.” The Immigration Judge did not rule that the bar to relief after the issuance of an in absentia order of removal applied to new asylum claims. Instead, citing the Board’s ruling in Matter of G-C-L-, 23 I&N Dec. 359 (BIA 2002), the Immigration Judge stated that a motion to reopen based upon the respondent’s claim of persecution under China’s coercive population control policies was “subject to the standard time and number limitations on motions, and to the exceptions thereto, as set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 3.2(c)(2) and (3).” However, the Immigration Judge simply concluded, without any factual findings or analysis, that the “Respondent has not shown that he is eligible for relief that was not previously available to him.” We therefore will vacate our prior order and remand the record to allow the Immigration Judge to consider that aspect of the respondent’s motion to reopen anew.
 
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals also ordered us to consider the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.¿FN1º The respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance was not properly before us at the time we rendered our prior order, for it was not previously raised in the motion to reopen denied by the Immigration Judge. The Board’s appellate jurisdiction in deportation cases is limited to review of decisions by an Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(b)(2). In addition, the Board “will not engage in fact finding in the course of deciding appeals.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Therefore, in an effort to comply with the order issued by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, we instruct the Immigration Judge to consider on remand the respondent’s motion to reopen based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 ORDER: Our order dated April 6, 2004, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

The court concluded that we had failed to address the respondent’s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. However, while his case was before us on appeal, the respondent advised us in a January 16, 2004, Amended Brief in Support of Respondent’s Appeal that his motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, submitted as part of his first appellate brief on August 7, 2003, did not apply to the proceedings currently on appeal. Instead, such claim applied to proceedings brought under alien number AXX XXX XXX, which had been terminated by a different Immigration Judge on December 10, 2002, with no appeal of this ruling being filed with the Board. We interpreted such statement in the Amended Brief as an abandonment of the claim of ineffective assistance raised in his first appellate brief. We therefore issued no ruling on the question whether the respondent could raise the ineffective assistance claim in these proceedings.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Riddhi Desai, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Gerrie Zhang
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated February 19, 2008. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision which denied his motion to reopen which sought to reopen his removal proceedings on the basis of ineffective assistance of former counsel (John Mendoza). The respondent’s motion is both time and number barred. The motion will be denied because the respondent does not show sufficient prejudice, so exercise of our sua sponte authority is not warranted.
 
The facts and pertinent history of the case are as follows. The Notice to Appear (Form I-862) was issued on August 21, 2004. The respondent was first represented by attorney Maribel Roldan. On March 16, 2005, Ms. Roldan moved for a change of venue on the respondent’s behalf and also moved for withdrawal as counsel, and noted the respondent was in agreement with both motions. Ms. Roldan stated that the respondent was eligible for asylum and withholding of removal. The respondent was next represented by attorney John Mendoza. In a June 5, 2006, order the Immigration Judge granted the respondent 120 days voluntary departure and the parties waived appeal. The respondent was next represented by attorney Brian Bates, who filed a motion to reopen on September 6, 2006, which alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel Mendoza and submitted the respondent’s asylum application. The Immigration Judge denied the motion as untimely. The respondent appealed and the Board dismissed the appeal in a February 19, 2008, decision (the respondent was represented on appeal by attorney J. Jesus Rios). The present motion to reopen was filed on May 19, 2008.
 
In the respondent’s present motion he alleges ineffective assistance of former counsels Bates and Rios. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (in whose jurisdiction the present case arises) does not have to date any published decisions on equitable tolling of the time and number limits for motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The Fifth Circuit has recognized and approved of our decisions in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the requirements to allege ineffective assistance of counsel) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (the alien must also show that former counsel’s actions were prejudicial to his case). See Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 164-65 (5th Cir. 2006) (stating the Board has determined that ineffective assistance of counsel is a valid ground for reopening, in egregious circumstances, and when prejudice is shown). We will thus consider whether the respondent’s motion merits exercise of our sua sponte authority. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (Board’s discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”).
 
*2 We find that the respondent meets the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, to allege ineffective assistance of former counsels Bates and Rios. The respondent has filed a detailed affidavit, present counsel’s letters to Mr. Bates and Mr. Rios, the response of Mr. Bates, and two bar complaints.
 
The Board held in Matter of Assaad, supra, at 561, that even if an alien meets the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, he or she must still show sufficient prejudice stemming from prior counsel’s actions. We find that the respondent does not show sufficient prejudice. The respondent claims that the ineffective assistance of former counsels Mendoza, Bates, and Rios combined to prevent him from timely filing for asylum and withholding of removal. The respondent, however, has never alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel Roldan. Ms. Roldan mentioned that the respondent was eligible for asylum and withholding of removal in the respondent’s motion for change of venue and her motion for withdrawal and noted the respondent was in agreement with both motions. The respondent was thus aware of the availability of applying for asylum and withholding of removal on or before March 16, 2005 (when the motion was filed), and cannot rely on the claimed ineffective assistance of succeeding former counsels for his failure to timely apply for asylum and withholding. We thus decline to exercise our sua sponte authority. See Matter of G-D-, supra.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sam Chung, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lynn K. Hollander
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent is a native and citizen of the People’s Republic of China. She was ordered removed from the United States on October 2, 2003, because she failed to appear for her hearing. Notice of that hearing was mailed to her former counsel, Liu Yu. The record also contains letters from former counsel dated June 19, 2003 and April 27, 2007. Therein, counsel indicates that the respondent did not stay in contact with her. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on March 28, 2005. The Immigration Judge denied the request on May 16, 2005, and that decision was not appealed. The respondent filed a second motion to reopen on May 3, 2007. The Immigration Judge denied the request on June 13, 2007, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
There is no time limit to request reopening of an order of removal entered in absentia based on lack of notice. However, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) provides that an alien may file only one motion to seek reopening of an order of removal entered in absentia. Consequently, the respondent’s second motion to reopen is numerically-barred from consideration. We further agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent was adequately notified of the hearing even if the second motion was not barred from consideration. Notice of hearing sent to an alien’s attorney is a proper method for notifying an alien of a hearing. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985). We will not sua sponte find that the respondent’s former attorney was unauthorized to represent her in these proceedings absent the presentation of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim that satisfies the procedural requirements. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION

Cori White
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on May 30, 2008, when it affirmed the Immigration Judge’s February 26, 2008, decision denying the respondent’s application for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). The respondent has filed a timely motion for “reconsideration,”¿FN1º and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition. The motion will be denied. The request for a waiver of filing fees is granted. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a)(1), 1003.8.
 
In its May 2008 decision, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal because he had failed to show that he was actually prejudiced by his former counsel’s failure to successfully challenge a change in venue in his removal proceedings from San Pedro, California, to San Antonio, Texas. The Board also concluded that the respondent had not met the procedural requirements for establishing that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383 (5th Cir. 2001); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
With his motion, the respondent has submitted documentation that he filed a complaint against his former counsel with the State Bar of California in April 2008 (which concluded in May 2008 that the matter did not warrant action). The respondent also submitted a copy of a March 2008 letter he received from his former counsel, although this document had already been submitted to and considered by the Board prior to its May 2008 decision. It is still questionable whether the respondent has detailed the agreement he entered into with his former counsel, although this is alluded to somewhat in the text of his motion (Motion at 3-4).
 
In any case, the respondent has still failed to show how he was actually prejudiced by the alleged failure of his former counsel to contest the change of venue from San Pedro to San Antonio. Although the venue change conceivably could have made it more difficult for witnesses favorable to the respondent to testify in person, he has not shown that the venue change prevented these individuals from testifying by telephone or from submitting affidavits or letters in his support. Indeed, he has not submitted (with his motion) any affidavits or letters from these individuals confirming what their testimony would have been.
 
The respondent also argues in his motion that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to allow the respondent’s former counsel to withdraw from representing the respondent following the venue change (Motion at 3). However, the respondent still has not shown how he was actually prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s actions (i.e., how the withdrawal of his former counsel and the appointment of a new counsel would have potentially altered the outcome of these proceedings). See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent styled his motion as one for “reconsideration.” However, because the intent of the motion was essentially to introduce new evidence to the Board, it is more akin to a motion to reopen, and thus will be treated as such. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).

ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before this Board on August 3, 2007, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent ineligible for relief from removal and ordering the respondent removed from the United States. On June 16, 2008, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent seeks to reopen these proceedings based upon an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Alternatively, the respondent requests that this Board sua sponte reopen his case.
 
The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on August 3, 2007. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not pertinent here), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before November 1, 2007. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until June 16, 2008. The motion is therefore untimely.
 
The respondent contends that he was forced to represent himself before the Immigration Judge as his family was not provided enough time to secure the funds to hire an attorney which amounts to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We find no merit to this claim. First, the respondent cannot succeed in proving an ineffective assistance of counsel claim since he did not retain the services of an attorney but represented himself. The respondent’s claim on appeal is not a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel but a denial of a right to counsel argument. Second, the respondent should have raised this issue on appeal not in the instant motion. Notwithstanding, during the hearing on December 20, 2006, the respondent acknowledged that he received the list of free legal providers and his case was continued in order for the respondent to retain the services of an attorney (Tr. at 1-4). On January 24, 2007, the respondent appeared without an attorney and requested a continuance in order to retain an attorney. The Immigration Judge granted the respondent a second continuance to retain the services of an attorney. The Immigration Judge warned the respondent that this was his final adjournment and if he did not retain the services of an attorney at the next hearing he would have to represent himself (Tr. at 5-6). On March 21, 2007, the respondent appeared without an attorney and the Immigration Judge informed the respondent that he would have to represent himself as previously advised. We find that the Immigration Judge correctly advised the respondent of free legal services and the respondent acknowledged that he did in fact receive the list of free legal services as required by the regulations. See Picca v. Mukasey, 512 F.3d 75 (2nd Cir. 2007) (regulation specifically states that in a removal proceeding, the Immigration Judge shall advise the respondent of the availability of free legal services and ascertain that the respondent has received a list of such programs.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(a) (emphasis added). This language makes plain that it is the IJ who must advise immigrants of the availability of free legal services during the removal proceeding. See Montilla v. INS, 926 F.2d at 166 (noting that the regulations then in effect, which were substantively identical to those at issue here, required that immigrants “be given a list of available free legal services at the deportation hearing” (emphasis added)). Therefore, we find that the respondent was not denied his right to counsel. We also decline to sua sponte reopen the respondent’s case. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied as untimely filed. The request for a stay is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Blaine Coleman, Esquire
 
APPLICATIONS: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on September 28, 2005, when we denied the respondent’s motion for reconsideration and reopening of her removal proceedings. On September 21, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted an unopposed motion to remand for further consideration of the Board’s determination in an order on July 14, 2005, that the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel need not be reached.¿FN1º In view of the court order, we vacate our September 28, 2005, decision and further consider our July 14, 2005, decision.
 
On reconsideration, we initially note that the July 14, 2005, Board decision accepted the respondent’s appeal under the provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c). Having done so, the Board acquired jurisdiction over the respondent’s motion to remand to apply for adjustment of status. The motion to remand was accompanied, inter alia, by an approved immediate relative visa petition that had been filed on the respondent’s behalf by her United States citizen husband. This was new evidence and, once the Board accepted jurisdiction over the respondent’s appeal, the motion reflected prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. Accordingly, on further consideration, we grant the respondent’s motion to remand to provide her the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status before the Immigration Judge. The issue regarding the claim of ineffective assistance of prior counsel is now moot.
 
ORDER: The Board’s order dated September 28, 2005, is hereby vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: On reconsideration, the Board’s order dated July 14, 2005, is amended and the respondent’s motion to remand is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings not inconsistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Moses Apsan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Court. The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s July 31, 2007, denial of his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of deportation entered on May 23, 2007. His motion to reopen was filed with the Immigration Court on May 31, 2007, within a week of the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order, alleging a lack of notice of the scheduled hearing after the motion to re-calendar the case was granted. On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Court requested in writing that the respondent file representations in connection with his motion, and he asserts that he provided a written response to the Immigration Court on June 8, 2007. He further asserts that, in this submission, counsel acknowledged receiving notice and argued that the respondent’s failure to appear was due to counsel’s error.
 
A review of the record, however, reveals no written request for submissions from the Immigration Court. Nor does it contain the written response supplementing the motion, which the respondent claims to have submitted. It appears, therefore, that the record may be incomplete. Furthermore, the claimed contents of the written submission would appear to have shifted the claim from one of lack of notice to one of failure to appear due to “exceptional circumstances,” i.e. his attorney’s ineffective assistance of counsel. Section 242B(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8U.S.C. §1252b(c); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). Yet, the Immigration Judge’s July 31, 2007, decision addresses only the issue of notice. Under these circumstances, we find it appropriate to remand for the Immigration Court to ensure the completeness of the record and to further consider the motion and issue a new decision.
 
Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further consideration and adjudication of the motion to reopen and to rescind the in absentia deportation order.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard Mendez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Delia I. Gonzalez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s written decision dated May 31, 2007, which denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his administratively final deportation proceedings. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
The respondent cites to precedent decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in support of his arguments that he received inadequate notice of his deportation proceedings, and that the entry of an in absentia order of deportation therefore violated his due process rights. However, the respondent’s motion arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and he provides no controlling legal authority in support of the foregoing arguments. See generally Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25 (BIA 1989) (providing that the Board follows circuit precedent in cases arising in that circuit). Thus, despite the respondent’s appellate contentions, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to establish that his failure to appear at his deportation hearing was caused by a lack of notice of such hearing. In particular, the respondent’s claim that he received inadequate notice of his deportation hearing in light of his age is unavailing, as he was over 14 years old when he received his Order to Show Cause. See I.J. (written decision dated May 31, 2007) at 1; Exhs. 1A, 4A. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 242.3 (1989 version) (providing that an Order to Show Cause could not be served on a minor under the age of 14) (emphasis added).
 
Moreover, as the Immigration Judge noted, despite the respondent’s claim that he was “not made aware” of his obligations to appear in Immigration Court, the Order to Show Cause was personally served on the respondent. See I.J. (written decision dated May 31, 2007) at 1-2; Exh. 1A. Furthermore, several documents warning him, in Spanish, of his obligation to keep the Immigration Court and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (the predecessor to the Department of Homeland Security) apprised of his current address were personally served on the respondent. See Exhs. 2B-2C.
 
As the Immigration Judge observed, the hearing notices relating to the respondent’s deportation proceedings were properly addressed to the last address provided by the respondent when he was warned of the address reporting requirements, and the respondent does not claim that the hearing notices failed to be delivered to such location. See I.J. (written decision dated May 31, 2007) at 1-2. Based on the foregoing, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to establish that he was not provided with proper notice of his deportation hearings. The Immigration Judge therefore correctly declined to reopen the respondent’s deportation proceedings based on the respondent’s claim of inadequate notice.
 
*2 The respondent also contends that he is eligible for relief from deportation for which he was ineligible at the time he was ordered deported. An alien is not required to rescind his or her deportation order under former section 242B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b, if he or she is pursuing an application for new relief, and provided that there is no evidence that the respondent received the required warnings under former section 242B(e) of the Act. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). Rather, the motion to reopen is only subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b). Under these standards, the respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s decision, and after September 30, 1996. The respondent is consequently precluded from having his motion considered under the general time limitations for a motion to reopen.¿FN1º Furthermore, we are unpersuaded by the respondent’s contentions that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled under Ninth Circuit precedent or that the untimeliness of his motion should be excused due to his ignorance of the filing deadlines. Likewise, although the respondent suggests that the untimeliness of his motion to reopen was the result of ineffective assistance of prior counsel, he has failed to satisfy any of the procedural requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). As the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and the respondent has not demonstrated that his motion is exempt from the general time limitations, we find that the Immigration Judge was correct in denying the respondent’s motion based on the respondent’s alternate request for reopening pursuant to Matter of M-S-, supra. See I.J. (written decision dated May 31, 2007) at 2.
 
Finally, although the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge failed to provide a reasoned analysis for the denial of his motion to reopen as required by Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002), we find that the Immigration Judge’s decision adequately identifies and explains the reasons for denying the respondent’s motion. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

We therefore decline to address the issue of prima facie eligibility for relief from deportation, or whether the respondent would deserve a favorable exercise of discretion.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lynn Olinger, Esquire
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R, § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the pending motion, which will be granted.
 
On March 26, 1991, this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 5, 1990, in absentia decision, and denied the respondent’s motion to remand the record for failure to establish reasonable cause for his failure to appear at the hearing. On April 4, 1997, we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen for adjustment of status, and on July 29, 1998, we denied his second motion to reopen proceedings for adjustment of status, asylum, suspension of deportation, and withholding of deportation. The respondent has now filed his third motion to reopen proceedings, wherein he currently requests relief from deportation and argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel before the Immigration Judge and this Board.
 
Initially, we agree with the respondent’s argument that he is unaffected by numerical and timeliness requirements due to the date of his Order to Show Cause (OSC). In our precedent decision Matter of Cruz-Garcia, 22 I&N Dec. 1155 (BIA 1999), we recognized that the former regulation set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii) imposes no time or numerical limitation on aliens seeking to reopen deportation proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 242(b) of the Act. Accordingly, our prior 1998 decision, finding his second motion to reopen barred under 8 C.F.R § 1003.2(c)(2), was incorrect. However, we do note that while the respondent currently argues that the Board erred in that 1998 decision because the respondent presented prima facie evidence that “he never received notice of his 1990 hearing,” we note that his 1998 motion requested a remand to apply for adjustment of status and did not address his 1990 in absentia hearing.
 
Nonetheless, the respondent now requests that he be excepted from these timeliness and numerical limitations because he received ineffective assistance of counsel and, again, because of the application of 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(4)(iii). The respondent argues that his representative had been disbarred 7 years prior to his representation of the respondent, and that he did not, inter alia, properly address the in absentia issue which is postured herein. Moreover, the respondent also appears to argue that his representative’s firm did not properly advise him of the date and time for his hearing. Given our previous error in finding the respondent barred by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), and given the respondent’s current compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), we will grant the respondent’s motion, and remand the record for further proceedings regarding the respondent’s requests for relief. The following orders will, thus, be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

Michael P. DiRaimondo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William M. Hunt
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 11, 2008, denying his motion to reopen deportation proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed in part and sustained in part; the record will be remanded.
 
Upon review of the record, we adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge, except with regard to the order of deportation. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 3994). In reaching this conclusion, we find that the Immigration Judge properly denied the motion as untimely, as the motion was filed nearly 24 years after the respondent agreed to a stipulated order of deportation, and well-after the regulatory deadlines for motions to reopen provided under 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(1), 1003.43. Although the respondent presents sympathetic circumstances, he has neither demonstrated that he qualifies for an exception to the statutory and regulatory filing deadlines nor set forth circumstances that would justify equitable tolling of this lengthy period. He has not detailed a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, nor met the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Further, the respondent has failed to establish diligence. See, e.g., Baldwin County Welcome Center v. Brown, 466 U.S. 147, 151 (1984) (requiring diligence for invocation of equitable tolling); Galayr v. INS, 196 F.3d 1257 (5th Cir. 1999).
 
Given the record before the Immigration Judge, we cannot find that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion in declining to reopen proceedings sua sponte, and we likewise find that the circumstances presented by the respondent do not warrant the exercise of our limited discretion to reopen sua sponte. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (“the power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”).
 
The respondent also asserts that the Immigration Judge erred by failing to explore his eligibility for adjustment of status. The fact that the respondent may have become eligible for this relief after the time limitation on motions to reopen had expired does not excuse the untimeliness of his motion. Moreover, even if the respondent’s motion were timely, the respondent was not prima facie eligible for adjustment of status because there was no immigrant visa is immediately available to him. See sections 201(b)(2)(A)(i), 203, 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1151(b)(2)(A)(i), 1153, 1255(a); Matter of Garcia, 16 I&N Dec. 653, 657 (BIA 1978).¿FN1º
 
*2 In addition, the respondent claims that the Immigration Judge erred in holding that the fact that Yugoslavia, the country designated in the 1984 Order of Deportation, no longer exists is a matter for the Department of Homeland Security to resolve (Respondent’s Brief at 5-6). An alien who has been ordered removed may designate one country to which he wants to be removed and the Attorney General shall remove the alien to the country the alien so designates. See, e.g., section 241(b), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b). Although the respondent was provided with an opportunity to designate Yugoslavia in 1984, given the passage of time and the changes to the country since his designation we find it appropriate to remand the record for the sole purpose of providing the respondent the opportunity to designate a country of removal.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed and the request for a stay of deportation is denied
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for the sole purpose of allowing the respondent the opportunity to designate a country of removal.

We note that the respondent is seeking the opportunity to pursue adjustment of status. Adjustment of status is an extraordinary form of relief that was not designed to supersede the regular consular process of visa issuance abroad, and which may be granted only where a favorable exercise of discretion is shown to be warranted. See Matter of Bias, 15 I&N Dec. 626, 630 (BIA 1974; A.G. 1976); Matter of Arai, 13 I&N Dec. 494 (BIA 1970). Although we decline to express an opinion on the likelihood of the respondent’s success in such efforts, once abroad he may seek relief from the regular consular process, including any applicable waivers.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ralph A. Horton, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carla J. Hengerer
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 21, 2008, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States, following the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing on December 21, 2007. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, finding that a notice of hearing was sent to the respondent’s counsel on July 31, 2007, which constitutes more than adequate time for the respondent to have become apprised of the court date.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that he did not receive written notice of the hearing at his home address, nor did his attorney advise him of the new hearing date. The respondent indicates that he was unaware of the in absentia removal order until he was taken into custody. In support of his motion to reopen, the respondent submitted a declaration and an attorney affirmation from his counsel of record, Ralph A. Horton, Equire. The respondent asserts in his declaration that the Immigration Judge is aware that his representative failed to act accordingly and his ineffectiveness affected him. In an attorney affirmation dated February 14, 2008, Mr. Horton states that he is at a loss to explain how this matter came to the point of both he and the respondent missing the December 27, 2007, hearing date.¿FN1º He further explains that his younger brother died suddenly in October 2007, and consequently, his attention to work suffered and he became substantially behind in attending to clients’ affairs, thereby missing the notice of hearing pertaining to the respondent.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent’s attorney has admitted that he became substantially behind in attending to his clients’ affairs due to a sudden death in his family, and he missed the notice of hearing for the respondent. Moreover, the record reflects that the notice of hearing was sent only to Mr, Horton, and the respondent submitted a declaration stating that he never received notice of the hearing from the Immigration Court or his attorney. We find that the respondent has presented a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Alrefae v. Chertoff, 471 F.3d 353 (2d Cir. 2006) (court determined that IJ erred in rejecting alien’s claim of nonreceipt by failing to explain why alien hadn’t rebutted the presumption of receipt; IJ erred by not analyzing alien’s claim of exceptional circumstances independently of his claim of nonreceipt; and IJ failed to provide any explanation for his conclusion that alien failed to establish prima facie eligibility for reopening). We note further that the requirement that a bar complaint be filed is to ensure that collusion does not occur, and that the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a valid one. See Matter of Lozada, supra. Therefore, as we find that counsel did afford the respondent ineffective assistance and in light of the lack of any bar complaint, we shall forward this matter to the Executive Office for Immigration Review Bar counsel for review and the institution of any disciplinary measures deemed appropriate. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

*1 This case was last before us on January 16, 2008, when we dismissed without opinion the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 22, 2006. The respondent presently requests that we reconsider our January 16, 2008, decision under a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel.¿FN1º However, because we conclude that the respondent has failed to (1) establish that the 30-day filing deadline should be equitably tolled and (2) satisfactorily comply with the procedural requirements by which motions to reconsider under a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel are governed, the respondent’s motion will be denied. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). In addition, the respondent’s request for a stay of removal will be correspondingly denied as moot. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(f).
 
Turning first to the equitable tolling issue, the respondent filed the presumptively time-barred motion to reconsider (accompanied by the motion for stay of removal) on March 14, 2008. However, the respondent argues that he meets the legal requirements necessary to equitably toll the 30-day filing deadline by which his otherwise untimely motion to reconsider is barred. See, e.g., Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999) (applying equitable tolling doctrine to 90-day filing period for motions to reopen where alien is prevented by his legal representative’s fraud from filing motion timely). We disagree.
 
In Lopez v. INS, supra., the Ninth Circuit recognized that the 90-day filing deadline applicable to motions to reopen may be equitably tolled where the respondent establishes that he has been prevented from meeting the 90-day deadline by “fraudulent legal representation” of which he remains ignorant “without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part.” Lopez v. INS, supra., at 1100 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the respondent contends that his former counsel’s statement in a letter dated January 18, 2008, that our decision dated January 16, 2008, is “final” and that he is “not eligible to appeal” our decision rises to the level of fraudulent legal representation (Respondent’s Mot. To Recon. Exh. A).
 
We conclude that former counsel’s statements do not constitute fraudulent legal representation because they were correct as a matter of law when they were made. First, our decision dated January 16, 2008, is a final administrative order or removal. See section 242(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a). Second, the respondent’s former counsel was correct in advising the respondent that he was “not eligible to appeal” our decision or, in actual fact, the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 22, 2006, because the Act has expressly foreclosed from judicial review discretionary determinations, such as the one rendered by the Immigration Judge (and affirmed without further opinion by us) denying the respondent’s request for relief from removal under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1994), on discretionary grounds. See section 242(a)(2)(B)(ii), (C) of the Act; Fernandez v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 592, 596 (9th Cir. 2006). Thus, we conclude that the respondent’s motion for reconsideration is time-barred and not subject to equitable tolling.
 
*2 Even were the respondent’s motion for reconsideration timely filed, the motion also fails to comply with the procedural requirements by which motions to reconsider under a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel are governed.¿FN2º In Matter of Lozada, supra, we set forth the elementary procedural requirements for a facially cognizable motion to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The first among them is the requirement that “the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard.” Id. at 637 (emphasis added).
 
In this case, the respondent’s declaration attached to the motion to reconsider fails to describe with sufficient detail the “agreement that was entered into with counsel.” Specifically, the respondent’s declaration only reflects that the respondent retained his former counsel in October of 2004 to represent him during the removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge, and that she “represented ¿the respondentº in an appeal before the Board of Immigration Appeals (Respondent’s Mot. To Recon. Exh. B).”¿FN3º Thus, the respondent has failed to establish that his former counsel’s representation of him before us extended beyond filing the Notice of Appeal, submitting a brief or written statement in accordance with the established briefing schedule, and apprising the respondent of the issuance of our decision, all of which the respondent’s former counsel evidently did in accordance with their agreement. The respondent, in short, has failed to establish that the agreement he entered into with his former counsel provided for any legal representation after our adjudication of the respondent’s appeal. Further, we note that former counsel’s letter to the respondent dated January 18, 2008, invited the respondent to contact former counsel in the event he wished to make any further inquiries of his case (Respondent’s Mot. To Recon. Exh. A). The respondent evidently declined the invitation to do so (Respondent’s Mot. To Recon. Exh. B). Accordingly, we conclude that the respondent has failed to establish that his former counsel acted ineffectively.¿FN4º Thus, the following orders will be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion for reconsideration is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s request for stay of removal is denied as moot.

In evident acknowledgment of his motion to reconsider’s untimeliness, the respondent simultaneously filed a motion to reopen the record of proceedings on March 14, 2008. However, the purpose of a motion to reopen is to state new facts to be proven at a prospective hearing date based on previously unavailable or undiscoverable evidence that indicates a meritorious claim for relief from removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) (2008); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir. 2003). Here the respondent argues that the intervening decision published by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Camins v. Gonzales, 500 F.3d 872 (9th Cir. 2007), has rendered our decision dated January 16, 2008, legally erroneous. Thus, the respondent requests reconsideration of our earlier decision, not reopening for the purpose of submitting new, previously unavailable evidence or new applications for relief from removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied because the respondent seeks reconsideration of our prior decision in light of an alleged change in the law subsequent to the issuance of the final administrative order of removal in this case. Further, the respondent’s motion to reopen is also defective due to its failure to comply with the basic regulatory requirement that the motion be supported by new, previously unavailable evidence or new applications for relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).

2

We are mindful that the Ninth Circuit has provided for a limited number of circumstances under which it will not respect our strict adherence to the procedural prerequisites for a motion to reopen or reconsider under a theory of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 938 (9th Cir. 2003) (excusing alien’s failure to lodge a complaint with the appropriate state disciplinary authorities where alien offered a reasonable excuse for this omission and there was no suggestion of collusion between the alien and former counsel); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir. 2002) (dispensing with the Lozada requirements where counsel’s ineffective assistance was obvious and undisputed on the face of the record); Ontiveros-Lopez v. INS, 213 F.3d 1121, 1124-25 (9th Cir. 2000) (concluding that “arbitrary application” of the Lozada requirement is not warranted if alien shows “diligent efforts” to comply were unsuccessful due to factors beyond his control). However, we do not find that any of the circumstances requiring relaxation of the Lozada requirements within the territorial jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit is present in this case. It is fundamental to establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that the respondent show that his former counsel’s conduct ran afoul of an agreement for specific legal representation, and the respondent has failed to satisfactorily make such a showing. That is, the respondent has not provided sufficient evidence to establish that the filing of either post-decision motions with us after we issued the final administrative order of removal on January 16, 2008, or a petition for review with the Ninth Circuit was within the scope of the respondent’s agreement with his former counsel.

3

We observe, with respect to the insufficiency of the respondent’s evidence in this regard, that the respondent has failed to either (1) support the motion for reconsideration with a copy of the fee agreement(s) he entered into with his former counsel or (2) provide any explanation for his inability to do so.

4

We note in closing that Camins v. Gonzales, supra, was published on August 28, 2007, over six months after the respondent, acting through his former counsel, filed the appellate brief in this case. In the absence of evidence showing that the parameters of the agreement entered into between the respondent and his former counsel included the filing of supplemental briefs, post-decision motions, or a petition for review to the Ninth Circuit, however, we are unable to conclude and unwilling to presume that it did.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John E. MacDonald, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on April 22, 2008, on a motion to reconsider, at which time we vacated our prior November 30, 2007, order denying the respondent’s motion to reopen for ineffective assistance of counsel, and found that while the respondent was technically eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(h) of the Act on a nunc pro tunc basis, the respondent still had failed to demonstrate a sufficient basis to afford the respondent nunc pro tunc relief Accordingly, we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our previous denial of his motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has now filed a motion to reconsider our April 22, 2008, decision, arguing that we erred in considering issues of fact which should have been properly remanded to the Immigration Court. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent’s motion to reconsider is barred by regulation. A party may not seek reconsideration of a decision which denied a previous motion to reconsider. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). Herein, the respondent requests that we reconsider our previous April 22, 2008, denial of his motion to reconsider our November 30, 2007, decision. However, due to the unique posture of the case, in which we vacated, in part, the November 30, 2007, decision, we will also address the merits of his decision. In short, the respondent argues that the Board erred in our previous decision by finding that he was entitled to consideration of his waiver of inadmissibility on a nunc pro tunc basis. Specifically, we held that, in accordance with Matter of Balao, 20 I&N Dec. 440 (BIA 1992), the respondent had not demonstrated that he had departed and returned to the United States since the time of his 1980 conviction; moreover, we found that his delay in receiving a grant of his Form I-130 petition was not an error justifying nunc pro tunc consideration. See generally Fierro v. Reno, 217 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2000). The respondent now argues that he did, indeed, depart the United States subsequent to his 1980 conviction, and he further argues that the delay in the adjudication of his Form I-130 is a finding of fact which should be addressed, in the first instance, by the Immigration Judge.
 
Generally, a motion to reopen will not be granted unless it states new and material facts, is supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material, and establishes a prima facie case of statutory AXX XXX XXX and discretionary eligibility for the underlying substantive relief sought. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992); 8 CF.R. §§ 1003.2 and 1003.8. In the case of claims under the standards set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), an alien must demonstrate at least prima facie evidence that the outcome of the case would have been different if he had been represented by adequate counsel. We find, in the instant case, that the respondent simply did not demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief so as to demonstrate prejudice in his initial November 30, 2007, ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The respondent now argues that he had no idea that his departure and reentry into the United States was “relevant” until our April 22, 2008, decision; however, it is he who raised the issue of nunc pro tunc availability and should have been aware of the law set forth in Matter of Balao, supra, and Matter of Parodi, 17 I&N Dec. 608 (BIA 1980). Similarly, the respondent did not present a modicum of evidence that error or bad faith existed in the timing of his Form I-130 approval, but argues only that this issue should be explored at the Immigration Court level. Inasmuch as the respondent carries the burden of demonstrating that a motion to reopen is warranted, we find no error in our previous decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reconsider. Accordingly, inasmuch as the respondent does not identify specific error in our prior order, or call our attention to a change of law stated or relied upon in our earlier decision, the motion is denied. See 8 CF.R. § 1003.2; see Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Audra Behne, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Piepmeier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on August 30, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision of October 1, 2003, denying the respondent’s application for adjustment of status, but granting him 60 days voluntary departure. On December 28, 2007, the respondent filed the instant motion, which is captioned as a motion to reopen but is more properly construed as a motion to reconsider. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)-(c). On January 8, 2008, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) timely filed an opposition to the respondent’s motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based upon the previous factual record, whereas a motion to reopen seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57-58 (BIA 2006). In this case, the respondent’s motion is captioned as a motion to reopen. However, the respondent failed to explain how the fact that the total period of time that an alien may be granted voluntary departure, including any extensions, may not exceed 120 days, is new or previously unavailable evidence (Mot. at 4). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(f). Instead, as we will discuss more fully below, the respondent’s motion contests the correctness of the Board’s decision dated August 30, 2007. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is more properly construed as a motion to reconsider.
 
Regardless of how we construe the respondent’s motion, it is untimely. A motion to reconsider must be filed with the Board within 30 days after the mailing of the Board’s prior decision, whereas a motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2), (c)(2). In this case, a motion to reconsider would have been due on or before October 1, 2007, and a motion to reopen would have been due on or before November 28, 2007. However, the Board did not receive the respondent’s motion until December 28, 2007. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion was filed out of time, and accordingly, will be denied.
 
Relying on Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001), the respondent argues that the motions filing deadline should be equitably tolled because the Board misinterpreted the amended regulations promulgated on May 12, 2006, pertaining to the eligibility of arriving aliens in removal proceedings to apply for adjustment of status (Mot. at 2-4). We disagree. As we explained in our decision dated August 30, 2007, the amended regulations make clear that an Immigration Judge does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate an application for adjustment of status filed by an arriving alien in removal proceedings except in a very limited circumstance, involving aliens who previously filed adjustment applications, departed and returned to the United States under advance parole, and were subsequently placed in removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(1)(ii). Accordingly, we determined that since the respondent is an arriving alien and does not come within the narrow exception which would permit an Immigration Judge to consider his application for adjustment of status, a remand was not warranted in this case. In so doing, we noted that the respondent must pursue any application for adjustment of status with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) independent of these removal proceedings. See generally Matter of Castro, 21 I&N Dec. 379 (BIA 1996).
 
*2 Similarly, relying on the supplementary information published along with the amended regulations, the respondent argues that the Board failed to consider the respondent’s claim under Matter of Garcia, 16 I&N Dec. 653 (BIA 1978) and Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002) (Mot. at 5-7). However, the supplementary information upon which the respondent relies does not carry the same binding authority as the regulation itself. Moreover, the excerpt which the respondent quotes in his motion is drawn from the section seeking public comment on whether rules limiting the exercise of discretion or implementing a presumption against favorably exercising discretion should be established in order to preserve the integrity of the nonimmigrant and immigrant visa issuance process. See 71 Fed. Reg. 27585, 27588-90 (May 12, 2006).
 
The respondent also argues that he has been denied a meaningful opportunity to apply for adjustment of status as an arriving alien (Mot. at 7-9). However, the regulations simply require that the respondent pursue his application for adjustment of status with USCIS independent of these removal proceedings. In addition, it is well-settled that the immigrant visa process remains the proper means for an alien to seek admission to the United States as a lawful permanent resident. See Santos v, INS, 375 F.2d 262, 264 (9th Cir. 1967). Accordingly, the respondent makes no argument in his motion that would persuade us that we misinterpreted the amended regulations such that equitably tolling the motions filing deadline would be warranted in this case.
 
To the extent that the respondent seeks to have this Board exercise its sua sponte authority to grant his motion (Mot. at 5), we note that our sua sponte authority is limited to exceptional circumstances, and we are not persuaded that such circumstances present themselves here. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); see also INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992).
 
The respondent also appears to seek to have this Board reissue our decision of August 30, 2007. In general, we will reissue a decision where some administrative error at the Board has resulted in a defect of service which, if not corrected, would prevent a party from perfecting a timely appeal or complying with a voluntary departure deadline. In addition, we will generally reissue a decision in order to remedy an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, e.g., where an alien’s attorney received notice of our decision but failed to inform the alien of such receipt until after the relevant filing or voluntary departure deadline has passed. However, neither situation presents itself here. Accordingly, we find no basis upon which to reissue our decision of August 30, 2007. Finally, to the extent that the respondent seeks to have this Board further extend his voluntary departure period, we have no authority to do so. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(f).
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN RE: MARWAN HACHEM, BENEFICIARY OF A VISA PETITION FILED BY TIFFANY SHARNELL JACKSON, PETITIONER
File: AXX XX6 587 - Santa Ana, CA
July 2, 2008
 
IN VISA PETITION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER:
 
Joshua Effron, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cathy Lin
Associate Regional Counsel
*1 The petitioner has appealed from a February 28, 2007, District Director’s (hereinafter, “director”) decision denying the visa petition she submitted on behalf of the beneficiary as her spouse. The District Director cited the lack of evidence the petitioner and beneficiary had shared a joint life in denying the petition. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
In visa petition proceedings, the petitioner has the burden of establishing eligibility for the benefit sought. Matter of Brantigan, 11 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 1966). The petitioner must prove the required elements by a preponderance of the evidence. Matter of Pazandeh, 19 I&N Dec. 884 (BIA 1989). Where the bona fides of a marriage are challenged, the petitioner must present documentary or testimonial evidence to show that it was not entered into for the primary purpose of evading the immigration laws. See Matter of Phillis, 15 I&N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975). However, we note that the failure to produce affirmative evidence of the bona fides of the marriage, by itself, is not sufficient to establish that the marriage is a sham marriage. Compare 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(B), (D) with 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(ii).
 
In the Notice of Intent to Deny the director noted that at a preliminary interview on December 1, 2004, the beneficiary denied ever residing at the address listed on all immigration documents provided in conjunction with the instant visa petition as the primary residence of himself and the petitioner. Concerns were further raised when further investigation revealed that this residence was the same as that involved in a number of cases involved in an immigration fraud scheme related to the parties’ prior attorney. Various issues were noted at a site visit to the residence they allegedly shared, including evidence the petitioner had only recently moved into the apartment, the lack of pictures of them as a couple, the continued lack of joint assets, and the beneficiary’s “superficial knowledge” of the petitioner’s employment history. The notice concluded the parties had not lived together as a married couple, but had attempted to deceive the immigration service in order to obtain an immigration benefit by entering into a marriage that is not bona fide. The petitioner offered an extensive rebuttal to the notice.
 
The director’s decision denying the visa petition found the petitioner’s rebuttal arguments included incorrect assertions regarding statements provided by the beneficiary to immigration officers, and failed to provide a convincing explanation of concerns raised during a site visit by immigration officers. On appeal the petitioner alleges the site visit violated her due process rights, immigration officers had no right to speak with her daughter during the visit as she was not present, neighbors should have been contacted at that time but were not, maintains she and the beneficiary did not need to reside together to establish eligibility for adjustment for him, and offers further arguments regarding concerns raised by the site visit, among other allegations.
 
*2 We agree that the petitioner’s explanations for the numerous concerns raised in this record are not persuasive. In order to establish whether immigration benefits are to be made available based upon a marriage, it must be determined whether the bride and groom intended to establish a life together at the time they were married. Matter of Laureano, 19 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 1983); Matter of McKee, 17 I&N Dec. 332 (BIA 1980), The conduct of the parties before and after marriage is relevant to their intent at the time of marriage. Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604 (1953). Where, as here, there is reason to doubt the validity of the marital relationship, the petitioner must present evidence to show that the marriage was not entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws. Matter of Laureano, supra; Matter of Phillis, 15 I&N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975). Absent evidence that a marriage was a sham in its inception or entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws, a spousal visa petition cannot be denied merely because the parties were separated or no longer together, rather such is only a relevant factor in ascertaining the parties’ intent at the time of the marriage. Matter of Adalatkhah, 17 I&N Dec. 404 (BIA 1980); Matter of McKee, supra.
 
The beneficiary and petitioner both conceded that the address listed as their primary residence on all their initial documentation was, in fact, an address at which neither ever resided, but which instead was their former representative’s address. While the petitioner claims the parties were the “victims” of this individual (who was reportedly convicted of immigration fraud in the context of other immigration claims), there is no evidence the petitioner has attempted to contact this former representative and notify him of the allegations against him. As such, there is not even minimal evidence of compliance with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1stCir. 1988), and we give lessened weight to the petitioner’s claimed ignorance of the fraudulent methods of this individual.
 
Most significant in this record is the absence of evidence the parties entered into their marriage intending to establish a life together. See Matter of McKee, supra. In her rebuttal to the Notice of Intent to Deny and on appeal the petitioner fails to clearly explain exactly when and where she and the beneficiary resided together as a married couple. She vaguely excuses the absence of credible evidence in this regard by suggesting that they have an unconventional marriage. The sole address where she reports living with the beneficiary for an extended period is 1549 Westgate Avenue, Los Angeles. However, the record contradicts this claim, and fails to support her essential claim that her marriage is a bona fide one.
 
*3 The marriage certificate reflects the parties married May 10, 2003, and were both residing at 1107 W. 59th Street, Los Angeles. (However, an immigration investigation revealed that the “mailing address” listed in that document was attributable to the petitioner’s prior representative. The petitioner did not report this fact, and has not rebutted this finding.) In his corrected biography, the beneficiary does not report ever living at this residence. However, a photocopy of the petitioner’s license indicates she reported residing at this address in March of 2002, and a handwritten notation on that document indicates it is her sister’s home. We note that the petitioner sought to excuse her sister’s lack of knowledge in 2006 about “where we lived and when we resided together” and her husband’s then-current address by claiming her sister had “never had much contact” with the beneficiary (Response, pg. 5). The inference, then, is that the beneficiary never resided with the petitioner and her sister at the 59th Street address, nor is there any contrary evidence in this regard.
 
Rather, the record is devoid of any credible evidence regarding where the parties resided when they were married or shortly thereafter. The beneficiary’s biographic information form indicates he resided at 1325 Amhurst Avenue in Los Angeles from December of 2002 through December of 2003. The record contains no evidence regarding that address for either party whatsoever. A handwritten notation on that document notes, moreover, that he reported his address as 10959 Wellworth Avenue at the time of his NSEERS registration on January 8, 2003. As with the Amhurst Avenue address, there is no evidence of either party residing at this address.
 
Contrary to the petitioner’s suggestion otherwise on appeal, it is not sufficient that the parties resided together at some time during the course of their marriage to establish the bona fides of that relationship such that immigration benefits should be awarded. Rather, our inquiry is focused on their intent at the time they married, and the record supports a finding that the petitioner failed to meet her burden of proof in this regard. As noted, the conduct of the parties before and after their marriage is relevant this inquiry. The evidence regarding the claimed residence of the petitioner and beneficiary at 1242 Wellesley Avenue is highly inconsistent. The District Director noted that immigration officer’s conducted a site visit at that location and noted the closets were empty of women’s clothing, the petitioner’s unpacked suitcases were in a room with an empty closet, and it appeared the petitioner and beneficiary had slept apart the prior evening. The apartment was also devoid of any photographs of the parties as a couple.
 
The petitioner has offered evolving and inconsistent explanations for the officers’ observations. In her response to the Notice of Intent to Deny, the petitioner concedes her husband informed the officers he had moved into the Wellesley Avenue address a “few days” prior to the site visit, but failed to include the crucial assertion that he had been living there before that time with his parents (Response at 2). We observe the petitioner later explained the lack of pictures on the walls and the absence of any of her clothing in the closets by stating the beneficiary informed immigration officers “he had just moved in and that he was not pretending to have lived there for a long time” (Response at 3). This contradicts her report that he had, in fact, been living there for an extended period of time prior to his parents moving out.
 
*4 No explanation was offered as to why the beneficiary did not inform officers he had resided in the apartment for an extended time prior to the petitioner’s moving in. Moreover, the petitioner has not explained why she also did not reside there with her husband. She claimed she “frequently” visited there and spent the night, but has not overcome the fact that the apartment contained no photos of her or the couple, and the lack of any indication at the site visit that she kept clothing in the residence other than that contained in her luggage. Moreover, her generalized allegations fail to overcome the fact that the beneficiary informed the immigration officer that he, the beneficiary, and her daughter had lived together at that residence until his parents moved to the United States in mid-2006 (Decision at 2).
 
Similarly, the director correctly noted that the petitioner’s claim that there were no pictures of her and beneficiary as a couple, because he had “just” moved in, was contradicted by her alternative report that he had been living there for months by the time of the site visit and, in fact, she herself had allegedly resided there at one point (Response at 3). As with the majority of the petitioner’s claims regarding her and the beneficiary’s residences, she offered vague and largely uncorroborated assertions about when the residency occurred. She claimed the beneficiary informed the officers that he had “several pictures” and that “most things were still in boxes,” and claimed he subsequently hung up pictures. In contrast, the petitioner claimed on appeal that there were no photos of them together at all the pictures had been moved to the beneficiary’s parent’s new home (Notice of Appeal, pg. 5). She also argued that they “had little reason” to put new pictures on the walls as they intended to vacate the premises shortly thereafter. These allegations are clearly inconsistent. The petitioner offered similarly confused and contradictory explanations for why her clothes were in her suitcase at the apartment rather than put away. On appeal she indicated she was too busy to empty her suitcases, although she allegedly had moved in several days earlier (Notice of Appeal, pgs. 3-4). However, in her response to the Notice of Intent to Deny, she alleged that she, in fact, had “frequently” stayed at the apartment prior to moving in and, in fact, had some clothes in one of the closets, although the immigration officers did not observe this. The record contains no objective evidence whatsoever indicating she ever resided at this address.
 
The petitioner’s inconsistent claims included her explanation for why the beneficiary stated she had only been employed once during the entirety of their marriage when, in fact, she had held several jobs. Her explanation that her other jobs were of such short duration that he did not deem them worth mentioning is belied by the beneficiary’s specific report that she had “no other” employment during the marriage other than working as a telemarketer, which was also of short duration (Response at 5).
 
*5 The only address at which the petitioner allegedly did reside with the beneficiary as a married couple, by the petitioner’s own account, was at 1549 Westgate Avenue (Response at 3-4). The beneficiary’s biographic information reports he began living lived there in January of 2004. It is unclear when the petitioner allegedly resided there since, as with the remainder of her claims, she has offered no clear information in this regard. She reportedly left for Las Vegas in January of 2005, without the beneficiary, although it is unclear where she was living at that time (Response at 5). The only objective evidence of a joint residence at that address are phone and utility bills to the petitioner and beneficiary from November and December of 2004. We note these records, without more, are insufficient to establish they resided there together during that time period, particularly in light of the petitioner’s evolving and unsupported claims regarding their relationship.
 
Thus, by the petitioner’s own account and in light of the evidence of record it appears she and the beneficiary, at best, resided together for a short period, more than a year after their marriage. We agree in light of the sparse documentary evidence of record and the petitioner’s changing claims that she failed to establish the bona fides of the marriage, and has not overcome the concerns raised by the director. In this regard, we find no support for the petitioner’s claim the site visit was a violation of her due process rights. The concerns raised therein were identified in the Notice of Intent to Deny, and the petitioner was afforded an opportunity to respond to the same. Her failure to adequately do so does not constitute a due process violation. We similarly find no merit to her contention that the immigration officers who visited her home inappropriately spoke to her daughter. The daughter’s stepfather, the beneficiary, was present at the time this occurred and any comments made by the daughter have not been used against the petitioner. Finally, in closing we observe that while any financial problems on the part of the petitioner may explain the beneficiary wishing to keep his assets separate from hers, it fails to explain the lack of other evidence they held themselves out as married. Such evidence could include insurance policies, property leases, or other evidence regarding their courtship, wedding ceremony, and shared experiences. Matter of Phillis, 15 I&N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975). In sum, we find no merit to the petitioner’s allegations of error, and concur with the director that the petitioner failed to prove the bona fides of the marriage.
 
The petitioner may file a new visa petition on the beneficiary’s behalf that is supported by competent evidence that the beneficiary is entitled to the status sought under the immigration laws. See 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(D).
 
*6 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXX XX5 634 - Los Angeles, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Colin T. Greene, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Piepmeier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; voluntary departure; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision of May 11, 2007, finding him removable as charged and granting him 60 days voluntary departure. During the pendency of the appeal, in lieu of a brief, the respondent filed a motion to remand seeking to reapply for adjustment of status based on his marriage on June 24, 2002 to a lawful permanent resident who subsequently naturalized on August 28, 2003. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) timely filed an opposition to the respondent’s motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed, and his motion to remand will be denied.
 
In his Notice of Appeal (EOIR-26), the respondent asserts that “¿tºhere were miscommunications and/or mistranslations during the interview process since the questions of the Immigration Officer conducting the interview were vague.” To the extent that the respondent is referring to the interview conducted by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on March 11, 2005, which formed the basis for a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) issued on December 28, 2005, and the subsequent decision to deny the visa petition filed on behalf of the respondent on January 13, 2006, when USCIS received no response to its NOID, we note that the respondent’s appeal is untimely and otherwise improperly filed. An appeal from a USCIS decision must be taken within 30 days of the service of that decision by filing a Notice of Appeal (EOIR-29) directly with the USCIS office having administrative control over the record of proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(a)(2). In addition, only the party affected by a decision is entitled to appeal to the Board. See Matter of Sano, 19 I&N Dec. 299 (BIA 1985); Matter of DaBaase, 16 I&N Dec. 720 (BIA 1979); Matter of Kurys, 11 I&N Dec. 315 (BIA 1965). In this case, an appeal from the USCIS decision by the respondent’s spouse would have been due at the USCIS Los Angeles District Office on or before February 13, 2006. However, the respondent (rather than his spouse) filed an EOIR-26 (rather than an EOIR-29) with the Board (rather than the USCIS Los Angeles District Office) on June 11, 2007, approximately 16 months later.
 
*2 The respondent also argues in the EOIR-26 that “¿tºhe former legal representative did not provide us (as the new lawyer) the complete records for this case.” According to the respondent, his new counsel was “not given the opportunity to review and/or examine this case completely.” To the extent that the respondent is making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we note that he failed to comply with any of the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We recognize that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this matter arises, has held that the Lozada requirements need not be rigidly enforced. However, we are not persuaded to dispense with the Lozada requirements entirely in cases such as this one, where ineffective assistance of counsel is not obvious and undisputed on the face of the record. See, e.g., Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). Moreover, the respondent failed to establish how he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), The respondent makes no argument on appeal as to how the outcome of the proceedings might have been different if his new attorneys had had an “opportunity to review and/or examine this case completely.”
 
Finally, the respondent argues in the EOIR-26 that “the Immigration Judge did not give us the opportunity to explain the situation of our client.” It is well-established that under the Fifth Amendment, aliens are entitled to due process of law in removal proceedings. Reno v. Flores, 113 S. Ct. 1439 (1993); Yamataya v. Fisher, 189 U.S. 86 (1903). In this case, we find the respondent’s due process argument to be wholly without merit (Tr. at 32-62).
 
Turning to the respondent’s motion, the requirements for a motion to remand are essentially the same as those for a motion to reopen. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). A motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application and all supporting documentation. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). In this case, the respondent failed to submit a copy of his application of adjustment of status along with his motion to reopen. In addition, the respondent failed to submit the required affidavit of support under section 213A of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1183a. We note that the record contains an affidavit of support executed on December 31, 2003. However, not only is it now more than 4 years old, it reflects that the respondent’s wife, who has been unemployed or retired since 1941, has no income or assets. In order for an intending immigrant to overcome the public charge ground of inadmissibility, his or her sponsor must demonstrate the means to maintain an annual income of at least 125 percent of the Federal poverty line. See 8 C.F.R. § 213a.2(c)(2). In addition, the respondent failed to submit the required medical examination report along with his motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.5.
 
*3 Finally, even if the respondent had submitted the appropriate application and all supporting documentation, he failed to satisfy the requirements set forth in Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). In particular, the respondent failed to produce clear and convincing evidence indicating a substantial likelihood that his marriage to a woman 41 years his senior is bona fide. Evidence establishing that the marriage was entered into in good faith and not for the purpose of procuring an immigration benefit includes: (1) documentation showing joint ownership of property, (2) a lease showing joint tenancy of a common residence, (3) documentation showing commingling of financial resources, (3) a birth certificate of a child or children born to the petitioner and the beneficiary, and (4) affidavits of third parties having knowledge of the bona fides of the marital relationship. See 8 C.F.R. 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(B); see also Matter of Laureano, 19 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 1993). In this case, the respondent produced no such evidence. Finally, as noted above, the DHS opposes the respondent’s motion for reasons unrelated to Matter of Arthur, 20 I&N Dec. 475 (BIA 1992).
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed, and his motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: LUZ LEMUS-CRUZ
File: AXX XX0 012 - San Diego, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
K. Kerry Yianilos, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lucinda Love
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the June 21, 2007, decision of the Immigration Judge denying her motion to terminate proceedings based on her claim of United States citizenship and ordering her removal to Mexico.
 
The respondent filed both a timely appeal and a motion to reopen removal proceedings. Having reviewed these documents, we will construe the latter as a motion to remand the record to the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4); Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1, 2 (BIA 2000). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a brief responding to the appellate arguments but not to the motion.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding her removable, as she claims that her attorney’s admission that she was born in Mexico was the only evidence offered of her alienage, and was legally insufficient. She further claims that in making such admission, prior counsel was “not fully aware of the facts” and “did not have a grasp on his client’s situation at all.” Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 5-6. We find these arguments to be entirely undermined by the fact that the respondent admits twice in the same brief that she was born in Mexico. Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 1, 5. Nevertheless, it has long been established that an admission by the respondent (or his or her counsel) of birth abroad is sufficient to establish a presumption of alienage and to shift the burden of proof to the respondent. See Murphy v. INS, 54 F. 3d 605, 609 (9th Cir. 1995); Matter of Benitez, 19 I&N Dec. 173 (BIA 1984); Matter of Castro, 16 I&N Dec. 81 (BIA 1976); Matter of A-M-, 7 I&N Dec. 332 (BIA 1956).
 
The respondent also claims on appeal that prior counsel “failed to adequately represent her case” to the extent that she was denied due process of law. Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 4. This claim of ineffective assistance of counsel will be dismissed, as the respondent has failed to substantially comply with the requirements for such a claim as set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that the Lozada requirements need not always be rigidly applied, and that substantial compliance may AXX XXX XXX suffice, particularly where ineffective assistance has been clearly demonstrated, efforts at compliance have been documented, and prejudice has been shown. See Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F. 3d 934 (9th Cir. 2003); Melkonian v. Ashcroft, 320 F. 3d 1061 (9th Cir. 2003); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F. 3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). However, in the present case, the respondent has not shown any effort to comply with Lozada, She has not detailed her agreement with prior counsel, or established that the claimed failures were the fault of prior counsel. In the absence of such evidence, we find the claims as to what efforts prior counsel did or did not undertake to be speculative.
 
*2 We additionally find the respondent’s assertion that the Immigration Judge denied the respondent of due process by rushing to a conclusion on the issue of the respondent’s alienage to be unfounded. Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 4, 6. The record reveals, to the contrary, that the Immigration Judge discussed the issue at each hearing with prior counsel; advised counsel against admitting the respondent’s Mexican citizenship (Tr. at 7-8), advised the respondent to file an application for a certificate of citizenship on Form N-600 (Tr. at 11), and granted adjournments totaling sixteen months before proceeding with the merits hearing.¿FN1º
 
We next turn to the respondent’s motion to remand. In her motion, she has established a new fact that could not have been discovered at the time of the hearing. She was married on September 7, 2007 to a United States citizen. She claims that this new fact would now make her statutorily eligible for the relief of cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(l) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 229b(b)(l).¿FN2º Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 1.
 
The respondent has included with her motion an application for relief on Form EOIR-42B, and has attached supporting documentation. We find that the respondent has satisfied the requirements of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). See Matter of Yewondwosen, 21 I&N Dec. 1025 (BIA 1997). In its brief, DHS has not expressed opposition to the motion to remand. We will thus remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings to determine eligibility for such relief. We therefore need not address the remainder of the respondent’s arguments on appeal.
 
Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge.

Although we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision regarding the issue of the respondent’s alienage, as we are remanding for other reasons, the respondent may submit additional probative evidence regarding the issue of her citizenship to the Immigration Judge.

2

In his oral decision, the Immigration Judge stated “the respondent is ineligible for cancellation of removal under Section 240A(b) of the Act because she does not have the qualifying relative” (I.J.at 5).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raymond J. Sanders, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alexandra Kostich
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Voluntary departure
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 26, 2007, decision granting him voluntary departure in lieu of removal under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). On appeal, the respondent alleges that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during the course of his removal proceedings and that the Immigration Judge deprived him of due process by discouraging him from seeking asylum under section 208 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158.¿FN1º The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has filed a brief in opposition to the appeal, claiming that the respondent pursued the instant appeal as a dilatory tactic and should, hence, no longer be able to pursue voluntary departure. In the alternative, the DHS asks us to remand the case to the Immigration Judge to impose a new departure bond that is separate from the cash appearance bond that was paid to ensure the respondent’s appearance in the Immigration Court throughout the proceedings. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
Initially, we note that the respondent’s appeal is properly before us because the respondent never waived his right to appeal in accordance with the applicable regulations governing pre-hearing voluntary departure (Tr. at 22-24). See Matter of Ocampo-Ugalde, 22 I&N Dec. 1301, 1302-05 (BIA 2000) (holding that an appeal of a denial of cancellation of removal was properly before the Board from an order granting pre-hearing voluntary departure under the Act, where the alien never expressly waived his right to appeal in accordance with 8 C.F.R. § 240.26(b)(1)(i)(D), the predecessor to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D)). Nevertheless, the respondent’s appeal is lacking in merit. We find no merit in the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Initially, we note that the respondent has failed to comply with any of the procedural requirements listed in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for claims alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. See Patel v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 829, 831-32 (7th Cir. 2007) (finding no abuse of discretion in the denial of a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel based on noncompliance with Lozada factors). Even so, we cannot say that counsel’s alleged errors impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing. See Mojsilovic v. INS, 156 F.3d 743, 748 (7th Cir. 1998). Specifically, the respondent does not allege with any specificity what “poor advice” his counsel afforded him (Form EOIR-26). Further, we cannot conclude that his counsel’s failure to advise him of his time frame for obtaining residency if his United States citizen father sponsored him for a visa adversely affected the respondent. The respondent testified at the hearing that his father had never helped him in this regard or even filed any petitions on his behalf (Tr. at 21), and he has not made any showing on appeal that his situation has changed.
 
*2 Similarly, the respondent’s claims that the Immigration Judge deprived him of due process are lacking in merit. Given the respondent’s failure to demonstrate that he is eligible for an exemption to the 1-year time bar for seeking asylum, or that he is entitled to asylum on the merits, we cannot conclude that the Immigration Judge’s alleged failure to permit the respondent to seek asylum deprived him of a fair hearing or otherwise deprived him of due process.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the respondent’s appeal lacks merit and would ordinarily be subject to dismissal, Nonetheless, as we have already discussed, the Immigration Judge did not have authority to grant the respondent voluntary departure in lieu of removal since the respondent did not waive appeal on all issues (Tr. at 22-24). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D); Matter of Ocampo, supra, at 1304-05. Hence, although the respondent does not appeal the grant of voluntary departure, we cannot reinstate his order of pre-hearing voluntary departure. Instead, we will remand the case to the Immigration Judge to allow the respondent to reapply for voluntary departure in accordance with the requirements set forth in the applicable regulations.¿FN2º On remand, the respondent is not precluded from seeking any other form of relief to which he may be entitled.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s April 26, 2007, order is vacated, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

We note that these allegations were raised in the respondent’s Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26). On January 11, 2008, we denied the respondent’s motion to accept an untimely brief.

2

In light of our decision to remand this case, we need not address, at this time, the DHS’s contention that the Immigration Judge should impose a voluntary departure bond in this case that is separate from the appearance bond that was posted on the respondent’s behalf. We do note, however, that voluntary departure bonds are only required when post-hearing voluntary departure is granted; they are merely permissive when pre-hearing voluntary departure is granted. Compare 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(3) with 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(3). In any event, we will allow the Immigration Judge to address the DHS’s contention in the first instance on remand.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Melissa Marie Chase, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)º - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
 
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment; voluntary departure; T visa
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of South Korea, appeals the Immigration Judge’s September 25, 2007, decision finding her removable as charged and denying her application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255.¿FN1º The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge’s discretionary denial of her application for adjustment of status was in error. Specifically, she contests the Immigration Judge’s adverse credibility determination. She also argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that she lacks good moral character. Furthermore, she claims ineffective assistance of counsel, denial of due process, and that the Immigration Judge should have considered her eligibility for waivers under sections 212(h) and 212(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(h), (i) and voluntary departure even though she did not request such relief at the hearing. Finally, she argues that she is the victim of human trafficking and that she is eligible for a nonimmigrant “T” visa.
 
First, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent has not demonstrated that she warrants adjustment of status relief as a matter of discretion (I.J. at 18-19). See section 245(a) of the Act (stating that the status of an alien may be adjusted in the exercise of discretion to that of a lawful permanent resident if the alien files an application, is admissible to the United States, is eligible to receive an immigrant visa, and an immigrant visa is immediately available at the time the application is filed); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(ii) (2008) (stating the Board reviews questions of discretion de novo). We consider both the positive and adverse factors in deciding whether the respondent has met her burden of showing that she merits relief as a matter of discretion. See section 240(c)(4)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A); Matter of Arai, 13 I&N Dec. 494 (BIA 1970). The respondent’s positive equities include her marriage to a United States citizen, her involvement in church activities, and the letters of support she submitted from friends and members of her community. See id. at 96. With regard to the adverse factors, the respondent testified that she has worked as a prostitute (I.J, at 5-7; Tr. at 43-45, 67-69). In addition, the Immigration Judge found the respondent not credible, and we find no clear error in this determination (I.J. at 10, 15). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). For example, the respondent testified that she did not know she was being recruited in South Korea to engage in prostitution in the United States (I.J. at 11; Tr. at 60, 63, 66-67). However, the respondent’s husband testified that she did know the purpose of her recruitment (Tr. at 51). We are not persuaded by the respondent’s explanation that her English is poor, and she did not know what her husband was testifying about. See section 240(c)(4)(C) of the Act (stating adverse credibility finding may be based upon inconsistency between respondent and witness statements).
 
*2 As a second example, the respondent made a false statement in the addendum attached to her adjustment application that although she has a criminal charge pending against her for prostitution, she has never been involved with prostitution activities (I.J. at 4, 11-16; Exh. 3). See id. (stating adverse credibility finding may be based upon inaccuracy or falsehood in respondent’s written or oral statements). The respondent’s argument on appeal that the false statement was made because she did not understand the contents of her application and was relying on advice from her attorney is not a sufficient explanation. The respondent clearly indicated at the hearing that she understood the contents of her adjustment application and that she did not want to make any changes to it (I.J. at 13; Tr. at 19-21). Accordingly, after considering both the positive and negative factors presented in this case, we find that the negative factors outweigh the positive equities. The respondent’s application for adjustment of status is denied as a matter of discretion.
 
In addition, although the waivers the respondent seeks under sections 212(h) and 212(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(h), (i), are relevant to her statutory eligibility for adjustment, they do not affect our denial of her application in the exercise of discretion.
 
With regard to the respondent’s argument that she is eligible for a nonimmigrant “T” visa allocated to victims of trafficking, jurisdiction over such applications rests with the Department of Homeland Security. See section 101(a)(15)(T) of the Act; 67 Fed. Reg. 4784, 4792 (Jan. 31, 2002). Such an application cannot be adjudicated by an Immigration Judge during removal proceedings. See 67 Fed. Reg. at 4792.
 
Turning to consideration of voluntary departure, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent was not a person of good moral character under section 101(f)(6) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)(6) (I.J. at 12-17). See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). Given her sworn statement at the hearing that the contents of her adjustment application were true and her testimony that she was not told in South Korea that she would be engaging in prostitution in the United States, we find no reversible error in this determination. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2008) (stating the Board reviews questions of law de novo). Consequently, the respondent is not statutorily eligible for voluntary departure. See section 240B(b)(l)(B) of the Act (stating alien must be and have been a person of good moral character for at least 5 years preceding application for voluntary departure).
 
*3 Finally, we consider the respondent’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and denial of due process and her argument that the Immigration Judge failed to inform her of all potential forms of relief under 8 C.F.R. § 1240.11(a)(2). We find that the respondent has not shown that she has suffered prejudice. See De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883-84 (5th Cir. 2004) (stating that to prevail on a due process or ineffective assistance of counsel challenge, an alien must show prejudice); Matter of Cordova, 22 I&N Dec. 966, 970 (BIA 1999) (stating an Immigration Judge’s duty to inform applies only to forms of relief for which an alien is “apparently eligible”). Accordingly, these claims are dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent filed her application for relief after May 11, 2005. Accordingly, her claims are governed by the amendments to the Act brought about by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Div. B, Pub. L. No. 109-13, § 101, 119 Stat. 302(2005).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Angela M. Bean, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James S. Stolley, Jr.
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on August 28, 2007, when we denied the respondent’s first motion to reopen. On March 24, 2008, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). On March 28, 2008, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) timely filed an opposition to the respondent’s motion. See 8 C.F.R § 1003.2(g)(3). The respondent filed a supplement to her motion to reopen on April 14, 2008.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied. The respondent’s motion to reopen is both time- and number-barred. A party may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); see also Matter of Susma, 22 I&N Dec. 947 (BIA 1999). This is the respondent’s second motion to reopen, and the final administrative decision was rendered in this case on April 30, 2007. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
We note that the filing deadline for a motion to reopen may be equitably tolled during periods when an alien is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the alien acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-99 (9th Cir. 2003); see also Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1194-97 (9th Cir. 2001). However, we are not persuaded that the respondent acted with due diligence in this case. Moreover, even if we were to toll the limitations period until the respondent retained her current counsel and definitively learned of her former counsel’s alleged defectiveness, she still failed to timely file her motion to reopen. See Ghahremani v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 993, 999-1000 (9th Cir. 2007).
 
In this case, the respondent alleges that her former attorney, Martin Guajardo, provided ineffective assistance of counsel. According to the respondent, Mr. Guajardo represented her for more than 6 years, from June 2001 until September 2007. During that time, the respondent alleges that Mr. Guajardo never pursued any form of relief from removal, other than adjustment of status, for which she was eligible, including asylum and cancellation of removal as a battered spouse. With regard to adjustment of status, the respondent contends that Mr. Guajardo never filed a writ of mandamus to compel the DHS to adjudicate the immediate relative petition that her United States citizen spouse, Juan Lionel Melchor, filed on her behalf on or about May 14, 2001. In addition, the respondent contends that Mr. Guajardo failed to submit clear and convincing evidence along with a motion to remand, filed July 24, 2007, indicating a strong likelihood that the respondent’s subsequent marriage to another United States citizen, Anthony Olea, on July 12, 2007, was bona fide. Finally, the respondent alleges that Mr. Guajardo engaged in a pattern of sexual misconduct with her over the course of nearly 6 years (Resp. Decl. at ¶¶ 24-50, 56, 58).
 
*2 The respondent’s allegations in this case are very troubling. We agree with the DHS that the respondent’s allegations of sexual misconduct, if true, would constitute a gross ethical violation.¿FN1º However, we are not persuaded that the respondent acted with due diligence in this case. It is not clear why the respondent waited so long to file the instant motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. For example, the respondent reported that she felt humiliated the first time that she engaged in sexual intercourse with Mr. Guajardo in October 2001 (Resp. Decl. at ¶ 30). In addition, the respondent reported that she “had a second feeling that something was wrong with this relationship.” (Resp. Decl. at ¶ 33). According to the respondent, “this feeling was so painful that I hoped that it would just go away.” (Resp. Decl. at ¶ 33). Yet, the respondent reported that she continued to engage in sexual relations with Mr. Guajardo for another 5 1/2 years, until March or April 2007, and did not file the instant motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel until another whole year later, on March 24, 2008 (Resp. Decl. at ¶ 58).
 
Similarly, the respondent alleges that Mr. Guajardo never pursued any form of relief from removal, other than adjustment of status, for which she was eligible, including asylum and cancellation of removal as a battered spouse. However, the respondent reported that “¿fºrom the very beginning of our relationship,” thus, as early as 2001, she asked Mr. Guajardo about other forms of relief from removal that she had learned about through friends and on the Internet (Resp. Decl. at ¶ 38). According to the respondent, “I would ask him, “What about asylum? What about VAWA?” (Resp. Decl. at ¶ 38). Moreover, the respondent reported that in 2006, Geri Kahn, an immigration lawyer with Jewish Family and Children Services, informed her not to rely solely on the immediate relative petition that Mr. Melchor filed on her behalf, but rather to file as many applications for relief from removal as possible (Resp. Decl. at ¶ 52). Thus, the respondent knew, or should have known, as early as 2001, but certainly by 2006, that Mr. Guajardo allegedly provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Yet, she waited until March 24, 2008, at least 2 years later and as many as 7 years later, to file the instant motion to reopen. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the respondent acted with due diligence in this case.
 
The respondent also contends that Mr. Guajardo never filed a writ of mandamus to compel the DHS to adjudicate the immediate relative petition that Mr. Melchor filed on her behalf on or about May 14, 2001. Here too, the respondent alleges that she asked Mr. Guajardo repeatedly throughout the course of the more than 6 years that he represented her, “When are you going to sue INS?” (Resp. Decl. at ¶ 42). According to the respondent, “¿eºvery appointment with ¿ Mr. Guajardoº followed the same pattern” (Resp. Decl. at ¶ 42). Thus, we are not persuaded that the respondent acted with due diligence by waiting until March 24, 2008, to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, when Mr. Guajardo apparently ignored her directives to sue the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, now the DHS, for more than 6 years.
 
*3 To the extent that the respondent is alleging that Mr. Guajardo provided ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to submit clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood that the respondent’s marriage to Mr. Olea on July 12, 2007, was bona fide, the respondent knew, or should have known, that Mr. Guajardo provided such alleged infective assistance of counsel when we issued our order on August 28, 2007, finding that the respondent “has failed to establish clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood that the marriage is bona fide.” Yet, the respondent waited 7 months, until March 24, 2008, to file the instant motion to reopen. Thus, we are not persuaded that the respondent acted with due diligence in this case. Accordingly, equitable tolling is not warranted.
 
However, even if we assume that the respondent did not definitively learn that Mr. Guajardo allegedly provided ineffective assistance of counsel until she retained her current counsel in September 2007 (Resp. Mot. at 16, 27), she still did not file the instant motion to reopen until approximately 6 months later, on March 24, 2008. Thus, even if we were to equitably toll the limitations period until September 26, 2007, the latest date that the respondent possibly retained current counsel, the respondent still failed to timely file her motion to reopen on or before December 26, 2007, 90 days later. See Ghahremani v. Gonzales, supra. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen is both time- and number-barred.
 
We note that the time and numerical limitations do not apply where the applicant seeks to apply or reapply for asylum or withholding of removal based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). In this case, the respondent seeks to apply for asylum, but alleges no changed circumstances in Russia. Accordingly, we find no basis for excepting the respondent from the time and numerical limitations applicable to motions.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

Although the DHS claims to make no argument as to whether the respondent’s allegations of sexual misconduct are true, it noted, for example, that the respondent could not have engaged in sexual relations with Mr. Guajardo in an attorney preparation room adjacent to former Immigration Judge Alberto Gonzales’s courtroom, because, according to the court administrator, there was no such attorney preparation room. (Compare DHS Br. at 2 n. 2 with Resp. Decl. at ¶ 26). Furthermore, according to the court administrator, none of the attorney preparations rooms can be locked from the inside, as the respondent alleged. Id.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Renae M. Hansell
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Withholding of removal
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The applicant’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s March 19, 2008, decision deeming his application for withholding of removal under section 241 (b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), as abandoned is dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the applicant, a native and citizen of Israel, was previously ordered removed from the United States on January 4, 2007 (Exh. 1). The applicant was placed into the instant proceedings with the charging document dated January 31, 2008 (Exh. 1). During a hearing on February 13, 2008, the Immigration Judge notified the applicant that he had until the next hearing date, March 19, 2008, to file his application for withholding of removal and he provided the applicant with the necessary forms and a list of attorneys (Tr. at 1-2). The applicant then appeared at his March 19, 2008, hearing without counsel and having failed to file his application for withholding of removal. The applicant requested additional time in which to obtain counsel. The Immigration Judge deemed his application abandoned for failure to timely file and ordered the applicant removed from the United States (I.J. at 1-2). On appeal, the applicant contends that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Despite the applicant’s arguments on appeal, he has failed to establish that he has been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel inasmuch as he has failed to demonstrate that he was represented by counsel during his underlying proceedings. In this regard, we note that no Notice of Appearance was ever filed on behalf of the applicant by any representative. Moreover, while the applicant contends that he hired counsel to represent him and has provided a photocopy of an invoice and credit card receipt showing payment to an attorney, we point out that the invoice he has provided is dated April 8, 2008, well after his hearing and application deadline on March 19, 2008. Finally, we note that, pursuant to regulation, the Immigration Judge may set and extend time limits for the filing of applications and shall deem abandoned the opportunity to file any application that is not filed within the time set. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c)(2008). Under these circumstances, we find that the Immigration Judge’s decision is supported by the record.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case is presently before the Board pursuant to an order issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The order remanded the record to the Board to reconsider the respondent’s motion under Sembiring v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 981 (9th Cir. 2007) and Salta v. INS, 314 F.3d 1076 (9th Cir. 2002). However, the court rejected the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel contention, finding that the Board acted within its discretion in determining that he failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
In reviewing our decision dated October 31, 2006, and the evidence of record, we find that the Board erred in dismissing the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen. We find that the proceedings must be remanded pursuant to Salta v. INS, supra, wherein the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that a sworn affidavit from the alien that neither she nor a responsible party residing at her address received the notice should ordinarily be sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery and entitle an alien to an evidentiary hearing to consider the veracity of her allegations.¿FN1º Id. at 1079. Furthermore, in Sembiring v. Gonzales, supra, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the alien affirmatively sought asylum, indicating that she did not have a motive to avoid immigration proceedings; she appeared in the Immigration Court on her originally scheduled hearing date; and her letter seeking reopening included documentation that supported her claim of lack of receipt of the notice rescheduling her hearing for an earlier date. Id.
 
As in Salta v. INS, supra, there is no indication that the respondent had any motive to avoid the hearing. The respondent appeared for his initial hearing before the Immigration Judge, and he had been a lawful permanent resident in the United States for many years. He also indicated that he contacted the Seattle immigration office numerous times to determine his status and to renew his alien registration card. The respondent submitted an affidavit with his motion to reopen and a declaration on appeal, stating that he moved to Seattle in September or October of 1999, and that he had mailed a change of address form to the Immigration Court in 1999. He also submitted the declaration of his aunt, Maria Henriquez, stating that in the fall of 1999, the respondent came to live with her for about three years. See Hernandez-Ortiz v. INS, 777 F.2d 509, 514 (9th Cir. 1985) (the Board must accept as true the factual statements contained in the affidavits submitted with a motion to reopen); see also Maroufi v. INS, 772 F.2d 597, 600 (9th Cir. 1985) (the Board is required to accept as true the facts stated in an alien’s affidavit in ruling upon a motion to reopen unless it finds those facts to be “inherently unbelievable”).
 
*2 Moreover, the record reflects that the Notice to Appear was served on the respondent by certified mail on June 17, 1997, but it was not filed with the Los Angeles Immigration Court until January 25, 2000.¿FN2º Consequently, if the respondent did file a change of address form with the Immigration Court in 1999, the court would not have had any record of the respondent, nor presumably any file in which to place the change of address form. Based on the facts of this case and the evidence submitted, we find that the respondent has presented sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of effective service.
 
Finally, we note that the record indicates that the respondent was removed from the United States in December 2006. However, the Ninth Circuit held that where the removal proceedings are completed, and the alien is removed, but then reenters the United States unlawfully, he is not prohibited from filing a motion to reopen. Lin v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 979, 982 (9th Cir. 2007); see also Reynoso-Cisneros v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1001 (9th Cir. 2007). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The Board’s October 31, 2006, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s July 28, 2006, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals also noted that “the use of regular mail is now permitted by the governing statute, and that some of the Grijalva-Arrieta proof requirements (e.g. documentary evidence from the Postal Service, third party affidavits indicating improper delivery, etc.), which made perfect sense in connection with certified mail, clearly have no application under a regular mail regime.” Id. at 1080.

On appeal, the respondent submitted a copy of the Department of Homeland Serurity’s “Request to Reschedule NTA Interactive Scheduling System,” dated January 7, 2000, indicating that the case was scheduled to be heard on August 25, 1997, but the NTA was not timely filed with the Office of the Immigration Judge.

Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony (as defined in section 101(a)(43)(B)) — sustained
  
APPLICATION: Reopening and termination
 
This matter was previously before the Board on March 31, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s January 8, 2008, decision finding her removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal. On May 27, 2008, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen and terminate proceedings, presenting evidence that the state court has revoked the guilty plea underlying the conviction upon which she was found removable and ordered a new trial. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The respondent’s motion to reopen will be granted, and these removal proceedings will be terminated.
 
The DHS charged the respondent with removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act. The record reflects that the respondent was adjusted to a lawful permanent resident on May 8, 1990, and that she was convicted on August 22, 2006, in the New Bedford District Court, New Bedford, Massachusetts for the offense of distribution of marijuana (Exh. 5). The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged based on this conviction.
 
With her motion to reopen, the respondent presents certified copies of the trial court’s April 16, 2008, order as well as docket entries from the Massachusetts court, which reflect that her motion for new trial was granted. The respondent therefore argues that because her guilty plea was vacated and a new trial granted, she is no longer removable, and proceedings should be terminated.
 
We agree. The respondent’s plea was not vacated under a state rehabilitative statute, such that it falls within the purview of our decision in Matter of Roldan, 22 I&N Dec. 512 (BIA 1999). The respondent based her motion for a new trial on her assertion that she received ineffective assistance of counsel, and in granting the a new trial, the state court agreed that her trial counsel’s assistance “fell below the standard of effective representation.” Attachment to Respondent’s Motion to Reopen. Thus, the state court’s April 16, 2008, order allowing the respondent to withdraw her guilty plea and ordering a new trial will be given effect. We therefore conclude that the respondent is not removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, and is not, at this time, a removable alien.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be granted, and these removal proceedings will be terminated.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: These removal proceedings are terminated.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Murray D. Hilts, Esquire
*1 This case was last before the Board on February 13, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. On March 14, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent claims that he has presented sufficient evidence to establish that due to ineffective assistance rendered by his former counsel, Robert W. DeKelaita, Esquire, he did not receive the notice of hearing, and therefore, he failed to appear for his hearing on August 3, 2006. After the respondent was ordered removed in absentia, Mr. DeKelaita filed a motion to reopen and a Notice of Appeal on behalf of the respondent. The respondent has submitted numerous documents with his motion in support of his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, including his affidavit, evidence that the respondent has filed a complaint against Mr. DeKelaita with the State Bar of Illinois, and evidence that he has informed Mr. DeKelaita of the allegations of ineffective asisstance of counsel. See Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857 (6th Cir. 2006) (a motion to reopen before the Board due to ineffective assistance of counsel must first present the facts required by Lozada); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
In light of the respondent’s new allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel concerning his former attorney, Mr. DeKelaita, who filed the first motion to reopen, we find that the record must be remanded to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s motion to reopen and a determination as to whether the respondent has established that he failed to appear for his hearing due to ineffective assistance of counsel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). Accordingly, the record will be remanded.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law.
 
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The respondent appeals an Immigration Judge’s January 30, 2007, decision sustaining the charges of removability, and ordering him removed to Trinidad. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
On February 4, 2005, the respondent entered into a plea agreement in the United States District Court, Western District of Washington for the offense of submitting a false passport application, using the birth certificate and social security number of a United States citizen, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, section 1542. Partly based on this conviction, the DHS initiated the present removal proceedings, charging the respondent with deportability as an alien falsely claiming citizenship. See section 212(a)(6)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii). The Immigration Judge also concluded that the respondent’s offense of knowingly filing a false application for a United States passport was a crime involving moral turpitude (I.J. at 1). Since the respondent had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, he is not eligible for adjustment of status, or cancellation of removal for certain nonpermanent residents. See sections 245(a) and 240A(b)(l) of the Act; 8 U.S.C. §§ 1255(a) and 1229b(b)(1).
 
On appeal, the respondent does not allege the Immigration Judge committed any errors in his decision. Instead, the respondent requests that we remand the case to the Immigration Judge to allow him to pursue post-conviction relief, either an amendment of the charge nunc pro tunc or a vacation of the plea agreement. The respondent argues that his current criminal conviction should be set aside because he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel by his criminal attorney in that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea to the charge of filing a false passport application.
 
*2 At the outset, even if we were to accept the respondent’s assertion that the attorney at his criminal trial did not explain the immigration consequences of a guilty plea, he has not demonstrated that his counsel’s actions were objectively unreasonable so as to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel and a violation of due process. To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must show that his counsel’s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has held that “the failure of counsel to advise his client of the potential immigration consequences of a conviction does not violate the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.” U.S v. Fry, 322 F.3d 1198, 1200 (9th Cir. 2003); see also Resendiz v. Kovensky, 416 F.3d 952, 957 (9thCir. 2005). The court has also observed that “¿wºhile ¿the Ninth Circuit has º not yet determined what ‘more’ would cause a defense counsel’s advice, or lack thereof, regarding the immigration consequences of a conviction to fall below an objective standard of reasonableness, the Second Circuit has held that an affirmative misrepresentation regarding immigration consequences is deficient under Strickland, supra.” See U.S. v. Kwan, 407 F.3d 1005, 1015 (9th Cir. 2005) citing United States v. Couto, 311 F.3d 179, 187-88 (2d Cir. 2002).
 
There is no indication in the record that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing. The record clearly indicates that the conviction record entered into evidence relates to the respondent and is final and not under direct appeal, and supports the Immigration Judge’s findings as to the charges of removability (Exh. 2). We note that nearly 18 months have elapsed since the Immigration Judge rendered his decision in this matter, and we have yet to receive any indication from the respondent that he has even filed a motion in his collateral criminal proceedings. An Immigration Judge presented with a facially valid charge of removability need not hold removal proceedings in abeyance based on the mere possibility that a collateral criminal proceeding could have a future impact on the alien’s immigration status. See Contreras v. Schiltgen, 122 F.3d 30, 33-34 (9th Cir. 1997), aff’d on add’l grounds in Contreras v. Schiltgen, 151 F.3d 906 (9th Cir. 1998) (Contreras II) (the court found that the “validity of ¿the alien’sº California conviction can only be tested in an action against the state, which has the greatest interest in preserving its judgment and the best ability to either correct or defend it … and … ¿uºntil ¿the alienº has successfully overturned his conviction in such a proceeding, the ¿Immigration Judgeº is entitled to rely on the conviction as a basis for custody and eventual deportation.”). See Baires v. INS, 856 F.2d 89, 91, 92-93 (9th Cir. 1988) (discussing factors the Immigration Judge must consider when adjudicating a request for a continuance). Consequently, no purpose other than an unnecessary delay of the proceedings would be served by a remand. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brad Alexander, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Motion to Reopen
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Peru, has made an untimely motion to reopen proceedings that were administratively final on January 15, 2004.¿FN1º The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent’s motion, which was received on April 29, 2008, was filed more than 18 months after the Board’s September 19, 2006, decision in this case and is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R, § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated that she qualifies for any exception to the time limitation on motions to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1129a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(changed country conditions or changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality).
 
However, to the extent that neither our prior decision, nor the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen adequately considered the fact that the respondent was never advised of the civil penalty for failure to voluntarily depart pursuant to section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d),¿FN2º and never considered the respondent’s assertion regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, we find it necessary to sua sponte reopen proceedings. See Tr. at 5-9; May 23, 2006, Statement of Robert A. Pajor and Patricia E. Pajor, at 2 (noting failure of prior attorney to timely file motion to reopen, and fact that prior attorney incorrectly filed motion to reopen). We therefore vacate our decision dated September 19, 2006, and the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 3, 2006, and remand this record to the Immigration Judge for a new decision on the merits of the respondent’s June 12, 2006, motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen proceedings on its own motion is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship).
 
At that time, the Immigration Judge should specifically determine whether the respondent has established due diligence in making her motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, and if so, whether equitable tolling is available to her. See, e.g., Rodas v. U.S. Attorney General 2008 WL 2122416 (11th Cir. 2008), quoting Abdi v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 430 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir.2005) (the statutory 90-day period for filing a motion to reopen is “mandatory and jurisdictional, and, therefore, it is not subject to equitable tolling”). If the Immigration Judge determines that equitable tolling is available, he should then consider whether the respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). In addition, the Immigration Judge should consider what impact the failure to comply with the statutory requirements for voluntary departure orders had on the respondent, and specifically, whether the respondent is precluded from adjustment of status as a result of the Immigration Judge’s failure to give such warnings.¿FN3º Finally, the Immigration Judge should consider whether any other circumstances in this case would warrant sua sponte reopening despite the time bar. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered:
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s September 19, 2006, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s July 3, 2006, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER; The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s motion to reopen in accordance with this decision, and for the entry of a new decision. Both parties may supplement the record, if necessary.

An Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure on January 15, 2004. The respondent did not appeal, and the Immigration Judge’s order became final. The respondent, who subsequently married a U.S. citizen on February 3, 2004, prior to the expiration of voluntary departure on March 21, 2004, and made amotion to reopen on June 12, 2006, which was denied as untimely by the Immigration Judge on July 3, 2006. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from that denial on September 19, 2006.

The respondent’s voluntary departure order was issued on January 15, 2004, prior to the 2006 amendments to section 240B(d) of the Act.

We make no finding or prediction as to the ultimate outcome of any of these claims. We simply require the Immigration Judge to fully consider the assertions made in the respondent’s motion to reopen, to the extent permitted or required by law.

File: AXX XX0 370 - New York, NY
June 11, 2008
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose Alexis Rojas, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 7, 2007. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The facts and pertinent history of the case are as follows. The respondent was personally served with the Order to Show Cause (Form I-221) on July 10, 1995. The Order to Show Cause, including the notice of rights and consequences, was read to the respondent in the Spanish language. At the August 22, 1997, master calendar hearing counsel was personally served with the notice of hearing for November 21, 1997. Neither the respondent nor counsel appeared for the November 21, 1997, hearing and the Immigration Judge entered an in absentia order the same day. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court on August 21, 2007. The Immigration Judge denied the motion in a September 7, 2007, decision (Exhs. 1, 2).
 
The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to rescind the in absentia order. The motion was untimely. Section 242B(c)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3) (1995), provides, in pertinent part, that a deportation order issued following in absentia proceedings may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed with the Immigration Court within 180 days after the date of the deportation order if the alien demonstrates that he failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances. Even assuming ineffective assistance of counsel as claimed by the respondent and his own error, the result in the case would not change. The respondent and counsel discovered their errors on November 24, 1997, when they appeared at the Immigration Court and were told that the hearing had been held on November 21, 1997, and an in absentia order was issued. The respondent took no further action concerning his deportation case until March of 2005 when he went to counsel’s office. Further, the respondent did not file the motion to reopen until August 21, 2007. The respondent did not show due diligence to warrant equitable tolling of the 180-day time limit. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006) (the court concluded that the aliens had not met their burden of showing why they had not been diligent over a 2-year period).
 
The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status. The motion was untimely. The Board held in Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998), that an alien is not required to rescind her deportation order under section 242B of the Act if she is pursuing an application for new relief, and provided there is no evidence the alien received the required warnings under section 242B(e) of the Act. The respondent’s motion, however, is untimely under the general time limitation for motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2) and 1003.23(b)(3). Although the respondent received the oral warnings in 1995, more than 5 years have elapsed and the bar under section 242B(e) of the Act no longer applies. Finally, we see no reason why the Immigration Judge should have exercised her sua sponte authority over the respondent’s motion. Becoming eligible for relief after a final order did not constitute an extraordinary circumstance. See generally Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (Board’s discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”).
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven P. Brazelton, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen and reissue our decision dated March 2, 2006. In our order, we dismissed the appeal of an Immigration Judge order denying a request for a continuance and ordering the respondent removed. The motion is untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent requests reissuance of our decision to allow a petition for review to be timely filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The respondent argues that, as former counsel acknowledge they failed to timely file a petition for review at the Ninth Circuit by filing the currently pending petition late, ineffective assistance of counsel has been established warranting reopening. See e.g. Dearinger v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir. 2000). The motion includes some evidence of compliance with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in that counsel has admitted the late filing in a declaration and also sent a letter to “self-report” the untimely filing to the State Bar of Nevada (see Motion at Exhs. E, F). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
However, the motion does not establish a plausible grounds for relief that would support a finding of substantial prejudice by the former counsel’s incompetence. Jie Lin v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent’s claim is the same as that adjudicated on appeal, i.e., that the Immigration Judge should have granted what would essentially have been an indefinite continuance to wait until the petition (Form I-130) filed on the respondent’s behalf is current. While a continuance may be granted for good cause, as the respondent is not eligible for relief, no good cause had been shown to warrant a continuance. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.6. The priority date for the respondent’s approved petition is January 25, 1996, and, as a fourth preference family-sponsored visa for an alien from Mexico, that category was not current at the time of our decision, and is still not current.¿FN1º
 
The motion does not establish there was ineffective assistance that substantially prejudiced the respondent during the removal proceedings over which we have jurisdiction. See Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241 (9th Cir. 2000); Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968 (9th Cir. 2004). The motion is untimely and does not establish an exception. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rhoda Wilkinson Domingo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joseph Q. Lynch
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case has been the subject of multiple prior decisions by this Board. On March 19, 1991, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance, suspension of deportation, and voluntary departure. On February 8, 2005, the Board denied a motion to reopen as untimely filed, finding that equitable tolling on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel was not warranted in the absence of due diligence, a showing of that actual ineffective assistance was provided, or a showing of prejudice and that reopening for consideration of adjustment of status was also not warranted in the absence of an application for the relief sought with supporting documentation. On March 31, 2005, we denied a motion to reconsider our February 8, 2005, decision, finding no error and denied a motion to reopen our March 19, 1991, decision as untimely and number barred. The respondent has reported that he filed a petition for review of our February 8, 2005, decision with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which was dismissed on February 27, 2007, with a mandate issued on April 23, 2007. On February 11, 2008, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen our March 19, 1991, decision, and to stay his removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the pending motion, which is denied.
 
The respondent’s third motion to reopen is untimely (filed after September 30,1996) and number barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent claims that the deadline for filing a motion to reopen should be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance provided by Sherry Lesson, the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Judge and on appeal and by Robert G. Berke, the attorney whom the respondent alleges represented him in the filing of the first motion to reopen which we denied on February 8, 2005, as well as in motion we denied on March 31, 2005, which was a second motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider the first denial of reopening.
 
As indicated, we have previously considered and denied a motion to reopen based on alleged ineffective assistance of Ms. Lesson and denied a motion to reconsider that decision and a second motion to reopen. The respondent in the current motion to reopen essentially maintains that he became aware fo the full extent of Ms. Lesson’s ineffective assistance and of the ineffective assistance of Mr. Berke on January 11, 2008, when his current counsel received a copy of his file. The current motion to reopen based on the alleged ineffectiveness of Ms. Lesson is untimely and number barred, as noted in prior decisions. As set forth in our prior decisions, we find that equitable tolling is not warranted because the respondent did not establish that he acted with due diligence. There is no plausible basis for concluding that an alien could not with reasonable diligence become aware of an attorney’s alleged ineffective assistance, where, as here, the alien previously filed a motion alleging such ineffective assistance years earlier and where the prior motion was denied in part for lack of due diligence.
 
*2 The respondent’s marriage to his wife occurred on January 11, 1999, years after the his appeal was dismissed in 1991. His wife became a United States citizen through naturalization on November 10, 1999.¿FN1º The visa petition filed on his behalf by his wife was approved on September 8, 2000. Consequently, it is not alleged or shown that there was ineffective assistance of Ms. Lesson in the failure to seek adjustment of the respondent’s status. Again, we do not find that ineffective assistance on the part of this attorney has otherwise been shown.
 
Although the respondent now claims ineffective assistance of Mr. Berke in the preparation of the first motion to reopen, the record reveals that Robert Kahn, Esquire, represented the respondent before the Board in the first motion to reopen. See BIA 2/8/05; EOIR-27 filed 12/4/04. Thus, there can have been no ineffective assistance in the filing of that motion on the part of Mr. Berke. In any event, as the respondent still has not shown that equitable tolling of the first untimely motion to reopen was warranted on the basis of ineffective assistance of Ms. Lesson, there could be no ineffective assistance with regard to the attorney who represented him in the filing of the first motion. The respondent also alleges that Mr. Berke provided ineffective assistance in the filing of the second motion because Mr. Berke failed to provide an application for adjustment of status with the motion to reconsider the denial of reopening and the second motion to reopen. However, that motion was not denied due to the absence of an adjustment application. We essentially denied reconsideration due to the absence of a showing of any error of fact or law in the denial of the first motion to reopen. The denial of the first motion was based primarily on the failure to show that equitable tolling of the time limit on reopening was warranted. The failure to submit evidence in support of adjustment of status was a separate and independent basis for the denial of the first motion. We denied the second motion to reopen for consideration of adjustment of status as untimely and number barred. Thus, we do not find that ineffective assistance on the part of Mr. Berke has been shown.
 
The respondent in the current motion to reopen essentially maintains that he became aware of the full extent of Ms. Lesson’s ineffective assistance and of the ineffective assistance of Mr. Berke on January 11, 2008, when his current counsel received a copy of his file. He states that he is eligible for adjustment of status on the basis of a visa petition filed on his behalf by his United States citizen wife which has been approved. He states that his criminal convictions have been expunged and that should a waiver be necessary he is eligible based on hardship to his United States citizen relatives which includes illness of his wife and daughter and his son’s service in the United States Armed Forces. Nevertheless, we decline to reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(a), an action taken only in “exceptional situations.” Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373 (A.G. 2002); Toufighi v. Mukasey, 510 F.3d 1059, 1063, fn.8 (9th Cir. 2007) (court lacks jurisdiction to review Board’s decision to not reopen proceedings under its sua sponte authority).
 
*3 Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied as untimely filed and number barred. The request for a stay of removal is also denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anthony D. Collins, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael Pleters
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent is a native and citizen of Colombia. He was served personally with an Order to Show Cause on August 24, 1989, and he was placed in deportation proceedings. On September 7, 1989, the respondent’s former attorney, Monty Roberson, entered into a stipulation with the Immigration Judge and the former Immigration and Naturalization Service. The stipulation provided that the respondent understood the nature of the proceedings, and he conceded that he was deportable from the United States based on the allegations contained in the Order to Show Cause, The record also contains proof that the respondent was granted on September 7, 1989, thirty days to depart the United States voluntarily. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on February 15, 2008. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on February 27, 2008, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen was filed after September 30, 1996, and it is therefore untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent indicates on appeal and in his affidavit that he does not recall having been granted voluntary departure by an Immigration Judge on September 7, 1989. He infers that he was not present in Immigration Court when the order was entered, did not know of its existence, and he would not have entered into such an arrangement even had he been present in Immigration Court.
 
The Board has sua sponte authority to reopen a proceedings notwithstanding the timeliness of the request when an exceptional situation is shown. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Here, the respondent implies that his former attorney entered into an agreement for the respondent to leave the United States voluntarily without the respondent’s consent or knowledge. Under these circumstances, it is appropriate for the respondent to have filed an ineffective assistance of counsel allegation against his former attorney. His failure to do so is a factor against granting sua sponte reopening. We further consider that the respondent was aware in 1989 that he was in deportation proceedings. He also indicated in paragraph 13 of his affidavit that he had received letters from immigration authorities, and he was aware that he was subject to deportation. The respondent provides no explanation for why it required so many years for him to verify his immigration status. We do not find under these circumstances that an exceptional situation exists to reopen these proceedings sua sponte even if the respondent was unaware of the actions taken on his behalf by former counsel. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on April 14, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal. On November 13, 2007, the respondent filed this motion to reopen our decision to enable her to apply for adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. As the motion has been filed more than 90 days after our previous decision, it is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent seeks reopening based on allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel against the attorneys who previously represented her in these proceedings. The 90-day deadline imposed on motions to reopen may be equitably tolled where the motion is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Jin Bo Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154, 160 (2d Cir. 2006). In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, however, an applicant must comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In addition, an applicant seeking to toll the 90-day filing deadline must show that she exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period of time for which she seeks tolling. Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000). In the instant motion, the respondent has utterly failed to comply with any of the Lozada requirements. Furthermore, it is not apparent from the evidence now before us that the respondent exercised due diligence in this matter. In this regard, we note that the respondent has not explained how her former attorneys’ alleged misconduct resulted in the untimeliness of the instant motion, and she has not described any measures that she took leading up to the filing of this untimely motion. We find, therefore, that equitable tolling based on the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel is not warranted in this case.¿FN1º Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

We find no evidence of any exceptional situation which would warrant reopening of the respondent’s case on our own motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (“As a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Claudia J. Lopez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on January 17, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. At that time, we found that the Immigration Judge appropriately denied the respondent’s motion to reopen her in absentia deportation proceedings.
 
On January 14, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit remanded the respondent’s case to this Board. The Court found that we abused our discretion in upholding the denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen because the record does not contain a signed certified mail return receipt to indicate that the respondent was properly served with the Order to Show Cause (OSC), citing Chaidez v. Gonzales, 486 F.3d 1079, 1087 (9th Cir. 2007). The Court directed the Board to address, if necessary, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We find that the determination on the respondent’s claims of a lack of proper service of the OSC, and allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel, requires further factual findings. In view of the Court’s order, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge to address these claims.
 
ORDER: The Board’s order dated January 17, 2006, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the order of the court and this opinion, and for the entry of a new decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gnoleba Seri, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Virna A. Wright
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Motion to Reopen
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Ghana, has made an untimely motion to reopen proceedings that were administratively final on February 17, 1994. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion, which was received on April 9, 2008, was filed more than 14 years after the Board’s decision in this case and is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent has offered no evidence that he qualifies for an exception to the time limitation on motions to reopen based on changed country conditions or circumstances in Ghana. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1129a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(changed country conditions or changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality).
 
To the extent that the respondent requests that we reopen proceedings on our own motion, we find that the respondent has failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of our sua sponte authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen proceedings on its own motion is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). Although the respondent has made a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in an effort to establish exceptional circumstances for his failure to timely file this motion, we find that he has failed to establish due diligence. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000)(Second Circuit recognizes equitable tolling of motions deadlines in ineffective assistance of counsel cases where the alien has demonstrated that both that his constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, and that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll). He has failed to adequately explain why he waited 14 years after our last decision before he was able to discover and pursue a remedy for the allegedly ineffective assistance.
 
Moreover, even if the motions deadline was tolled in this case, the motion would be denied for failure to show prejudice resulting from the alleged failures of prior counsel. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&NDec. 553 (BIA2003)(alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show prejudice). A review of the Immigration Judge’s decision indicates that he weighed the respondent’s equities against the seriousness of his crime. The respondent’s conviction for heroin trafficking was significant, and there is no indication that there were any ameliorating factors that were not made known to the Immigration Judge, or which arguably would have swayed the Immigration Judge’s conclusions in this case. Indeed, the Immigration Judge rendered an adverse credibility finding in this case (I.J. at 5) (“I do not believe that the respondent was telling me the truth concerning his criminal activities in pursuit of the sale of heroin, nor do I believe his account of how the $12,000 in cash found in his residence came to be there”). It is unlikely, therefore, that reopening would change the result in this case.
 
*2 The respondent had a full and fair hearing on his application for section 212(c) relief before the Immigration Judge, and the Board considered all relevant factors before affirming the Immigration Judge’s discretionary denial of the relief requested. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
George E. Crimarco, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated February 13, 2008. The motion is unopposed. Our review of allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are governed by our analysis in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Matter of Lozada, we stated that a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the applicant setting forth in detail the agreement between the applicant and his legal representative and what actions were to be taken on his behalf, (2) that the counsel whose reputation is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) an indication of whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. In order to succeed in a claim of ineffective assistance of prior counsel, a respondent must also demonstrate that she suffered prejudice as a result. See Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
The respondent maintains that prior counsel, in preparing the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), failed to (i) inform the respondent of the types of evidence that would be necessary to meet the statutory requirement that she demonstrate 7 years’ continuous residence in the United States after having been admitted in any status, and (ii) direct the respondent to gather evidence, and ensure the appearance of her witnesses to testify, in support of her claim that she merited cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion. See Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998). However, when the Immigration Judge and respondent’s counsel discussed the possibility that the respondent had not accumulated sufficient evidence to meet her burden of proof, the respondent stated in court that she had not failed to cooperate with counsel through inattention or design but instead because she was embarrassed to visit his office without the means to pay for his services (Tr. at 18-19). The record contains no response from prior counsel as to the respondent’s current claim of ineffective assistance. On the current record, it is not clear to what extent the respondent’s lack of cooperation, and to what extent prior counsel’s failure to prepare the respondent, were responsible for the dearth of evidence presented before the Immigration Judge. We therefore will remand the record with instructions that the Immigration Judge conduct the appropriate fact-finding to determine whether the respondent has met the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada.
 
*2 If, after resolving the necessary factual and legal arguments, the Immigration Judge determines that the respondent’s claims as to ineffective assistance are without merit, the Immigration Judge should once again enter an order of removal. If, however, the Immigration Judge determines that the respondent’s claims as to ineffective assistance have merit, the Immigration Judge should then entertain any applications for relief from removal.
 
Accordingly, the motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
German T. Flores, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Matthew R. Hall
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Suspension of deportation; fair hearing; remand
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely appeal from a decision, dated March 14, 2007, in which an Immigration Judge denied his application for suspension of deportation for failure to satisfy the extreme hardship and good moral character requirements for such relief.¿FN1º See former section 244 (a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254(a)(1). On January 3, 2008, the respondent filed a motion to remand the record to the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(4). The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
Initially, we will consider the respondent’s motion to remand. The respondent argues that the record should be remanded because the transcript “is replete with indiscernible statements.” See Respondent’s Motion at 16. While it is true that the transcript of the proceedings includes certain indiscernible lines of testimony, the respondent has not specified how such indiscernible testimony might have affected the outcome of this case. Specifically, he has not identified what material facts, if any, were omitted from the record. We find, therefore, that he has failed to show that such indiscernible lines of testimony caused him prejudice. See Matter of Exame, 18 I&N Dec. 303 (BIA 1982). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to remand will be denied.
 
With regard to the respondent’s appeal, we first find that the transcript of the proceedings is sufficiently clear to judge the merits of the appeal. Second, we find that on appeal the respondent has not contested the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact or identified any factual errors underlying the Immigration Judge’s decision. Third, we find that the Immigration Judge properly applied the appropriate legal standards and correctly concluded that the respondent failed to establish eligibility for suspension of deportation on both good moral character and extreme hardship grounds. In sum, we find no reason to alter the Immigration Judge’s decision. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

The respondent also moves for reconsideration of our December 4, 2007, decision denying a previous motion to accept a late-filed appeal brief. The respondent argues that the failure to file the brief in a timely manner was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). He has not shown, however, that he suffered prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Hickman v. Spears, 160 F.3d 1269, 1273 (10th Cir. 1998) (explaining that to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must show, inter alia, that the deficient performance was prejudicial). Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Fatma E. Marouf, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Piepmeier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reissuance
 
*1 On January 25, 2008, the respondent filed this motion to reissue our December 14, 2004, dismissal of his appeal from an Immigration Judge’s July 22, 2003, decision. The respondent claims that the office of his former attorney first informed him of our decision on December 9, 2007. See Tab A (Respondent’s Declaration), at 4. The respondent now requests that we reopen and reissue our decision to enable him to file a timely petition for judicial review. We will grant the motion.
 
Pursuant to the regulations, the Board is obligated to give notice of its decisions by serving them, physically or by mail, upon the parties affected. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(f) and 1003.13. According to the record, the Board mailed its decision dismissing the appeal to the respondent’s former attorney. The respondent claims after the appeal was filed, he repeatedly contacted his former attorney to inquire into the status of his case. See Tab at 3. He further claims that he immediately contacted his former attorney’s office after learning on or about December 8, 2007, that he was required to report before December 14, 2007, to the nearest Immigration and Customs Enforcement office. See Tab A at 4; see also Tab P (Notice to Obligor to Deliver Alien). On December 9, 2007, the office of the respondent’s former attorney informed the respondent that his appeal had been dismissed. See Tab A at 4. The respondent then sought the counsel of his current attorney, and he obtained a copy of his file from his former attorney’s office. Id. at 4-5. In the file, the respondent found a letter, addressed to this Board, in which the respondent’s former attorney states that “¿nºeither our office nor the client is in receipt of the decision notice.” Id. at 5. The respondent has proffered a copy of that letter, dated May 22, 2006, and date-stamped by the Board on May 30, 2006, in which the respondent’s former attorney requested a copy of our December 14, 2004, decision. See Tab Q.
 
Given the particular circumstances of this case, we find it appropriate to reissue our decision dismissing the appeal, thereby enabling the respondent to petition for judicial review. First, the respondent has substantially complied with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board. See Tabs A and T. See also Iturribarria v. I.N.S., 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Second, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has explained that when alien is prevented from filing an appeal in immigration proceeding due to counsel’s error, and is thereby deprived of appellate proceeding entirely, error mandates a presumption of prejudice inasmuch as the adversary process itself has been rendered presumptively unreliable. See Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1045 (9th Cir. 2000). In this case, although the Board properly mailed its decision to the respondent’s former attorney, the May 22, 2006, letter confirms that the respondent was not notified of our decision prior to the deadline for filing a petition for judicial review. Furthermore, in his sworn declaration, the respondent has stated that despite repeated inquiries, his former attorney did not inform him of our decision prior to December 9, 2007. See generally Singh v. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 1170, 1173 (9th Cir. 2007) (remanding a case to the Board to consider and specifically address the effect of affidavits of the alien and his attorney). Accordingly, we will reopen the proceedings on our own motion, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and vacate our December 14, 2004, order. A final order in this matter will be issued as of this date, incorporating by reference the text of the attached vacated order.
 
*2 ORDER: The proceedings are reopened, the respondent’s motion to reissue is granted, and our December 14, 2004, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated December 14, 2004, attached hereto, is hereby reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alan Diamante, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Piepmeier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered deported from the United States on September 16, 1993, because he failed to appear for a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on July 25,2007, but the Immigration Judge denied it on September 21, 2007. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that his failure to appear for his hearing was caused by ineffective assistance of counsel, and he filed his motion with due diligence after becoming aware that he was the victim of such. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002). The respondent indicates in his affidavit that he received the Order to Show Cause, but he did not receive the Notice of Hearing because he changed his address and did not notify the Immigration Court of the change. He indicated that he hired Enrique Zuniga to assist him with his immigration status, and spoke with Mr. Zuniga after he received the charging document. According to the respondent, Mr. Zuniga told the respondent that he need not appear for a hearing, and he would take care of everything. The respondent states that he did not hear from Mr. Zuniga, and he tried to consult with him. He indicates that he was unable to contact him in 1993 despite repeated attempts. The respondent does not indicate why he did not contact the Immigration Court to ascertain the status of his case. We will not equitably toll the period for seeking reopening to a time later than 1993, the point that the respondent tried to contact Mr. Zuniga because he apparently was concerned about his immigration status. The respondent by not filing a motion to reopen until July 25, 2007, did not exercise due diligence in these proceedings, and we do not find it appropriate to reopen them. The motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances was filed untimely.
 
We further note that the respondent indicates in his affidavit at paragraph 23 that he was aware in 2006 that he had been ordered deported in absentia. He does not indicate, however, the date in 2006 that he learned such information. He has therefore not established that he filed his motion to reopen on July 25, 2007, within 180 days of learning that he had been ordered deported in absentia. Wetherefore do not find it appropriate to conclude that the motion was timely filed even if we tolled the period for seeking reopening to the point that the respondent became aware of the September 16, 1993, order. Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2007). We will not equitably toll the period for reopening until the date that current counsel determined that the respondent may have been victim of professional negligence. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gabriella Navarro-Busch, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Prepmeier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening; cancellation of removal; voluntary departure
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated March 21, 2007, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider and reopen these proceedings so that she may pursue an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1). The respondent, through counsel, has appealed. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the respondent’s appeal.
 
With regards to the respondent’s motion to reopen, the Ninth Circuit has held that the failure to comply with the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), will not bar consideration of a motion based on the ineffective assistance of counsel, where the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance. See Granados-Oseguera v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 993, 998 (9th Cir. 2006). The factors set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, are intended to ensure both that an adequate factual record exists for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding that ineffectiveness assistance was clear on the face of the record where counsel failed to file application for relief).
 
In this case, the respondent’s counsel was ineffective because she failed to timely file an application for cancellation of removal. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 900 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel failed to file application for cancellation of removal by date imposed by Immigration Judge); Rodriguez-Lariz, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226 (9th Cir. 2002)(finding ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel failed to timely file application for suspension of deportation). The respondent was presumptively prejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance because it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004). In this regard, the respondent’s motion includes an application for cancellation of removal and supporting documentation.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is sustained, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge so that the respondent may be afforded an opportunity to apply for cancellation of removal. At the reopened proceedings, both parties may present additional evidence on the issue of the respondent’s eligibility for relief from removal, and the Immigration Judge shall enter a new decision.

This case was last before the Board on April 22, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s September 27, 2007, denial of her motion to reconsider.¿FN1º On April 28, 2008, the respondent filed what appears to be a motion to reconsider captioned “motion to withdraw the former attorney’s motion to reconsider improvidently filed and consider our motion to reopen filed on November 2007 that has not been reviewed.” The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the respondent’s motion. The respondent’s motion to reconsider is granted and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
In her April 28, 2008, motion, the respondent alleges that she had filed a motion to reopen on November 17, 2007, based on ineffective assistance of counsel which the Board failed to consider in their April 22, 2008, decision.¿FN2º See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). On May 12, 2008, the respondent submitted additional documents which reveal that her former attorney had been issued an informal admonition by the Office of Bar Counsel in the District of Columbia on April 24, 2008, relating to her ineffective representation of the respondent before the Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals. Based on our review of the record and the documents submitted by the respondent, we find it appropriate to reopen and remand proceedings to the Immigration Judge to allow the respondent the opportunity to apply for the relief that she seeks. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider is granted. Also, proceedings are reopened and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
H. Fitzmore Harris, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Daniel J. Pornschloegl
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This proceeding has been before the Immigration Judge and the Board on numerous previous occasions. In November 2006, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed, and the respondent filed a timely Notice of Appeal. During the pendency of his appeal, the respondent submitted evidence that his conviction for attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance-crack cocaine-had been amended to attempted possession of a controlled substance. Based on the additional evidence submitted, on February 7, 2007, the Board remanded the record for further examination of the respondent’s removability and eligibility for cancellation of removal. During most of his initial proceeding before the Immigration Judge, as well as during the first appeal, the respondent was represented by Melvin Duke.
 
After the Board remanded proceedings, the respondent hired new counsel, Dewey Nelson, to represent him (Tr. dated 3/8/07, 3/15/07, and 3/22/07). In an oral decision issued March 22, 2007, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), based on the amended conviction,¿FN1º and denied all relief. For purposes of the appeal, the respondent again retained Mr. Duke. On June 28, 2007, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his motion. Our June 28, 2007, decision was our final administrative decision for purposes of appeal. Thereafter, on August 15, 2007, and January 3, 2008, the Board denied two more motions.
 
On February 11, 2008, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen. The motion is untimely, as well as number-barred, and the respondent has not demonstrated that a regulatory exception applies. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2) and (3). The respondent alleges that the time and number limitations should be equitably tolled because Mr. Duke provided ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The fact that Mr. Duke was disbarred by the state of New York in 2000, and may not have been qualified to practice before the Immigration Courts or the Board, does not demonstrate per se ineffective assistance of counsel, or otherwise satisfy the requirements of equitable tolling, so as to to justify reopening sua sponte.¿FN2º
 
*2 To warrant equitable tolling, the respondent must show, inter alia, that he exercised due diligence during the period he seeks to have tolled. Habchy v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 858 (8th Cir. 2006); Kanyi v. Gonzales, 406 F.3d 1087 (8th Cir. 2005). In the instant case, the respondent admits that he was concerned about Mr. Duke’s representation as of October 2006. The respondent was apparently so concerned about Mr. Duke’s representation that, after the Board remanded proceedings, he retained new counsel. He then, however, hired Mr. Duke again for purposes of filing another appeal, as well as filing motions to reopen. Since the respondent was on notice as early as October 2006 regarding Mr. Duke’s alleged ineffectiveness, and has not provided an adequate explanation, the respondent has not demonstrated due diligence in raising ineffective assistance of counsel at this late date.
 
Further, the respondent has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by Mr. Duke’s actions. The Immigration Judge held that the respondent was removable under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, which provides, with certain exceptions not applicable here, that an alien convicted of a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State relating to a controlled substance as defined in 21 U.S.C. § 802, is inadmissible (I.J. Dec. dated 3/22/07 at 4). The record indicates that the respondent was convicted of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree in violation of New York Penal Law § 220.09, Subsection 1 (Gp. Exh. 8, Tab A and Transcript of Plea Agreement). According to the transcript of the plea agreement, the narcotic drug involved was crack cocaine (Gp. Exh. 8, Transcript). See also Respondent’s Rebuttal filed 2/1/07, Exh. A). The respondent’s state conviction is a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. See 21 U.S.C. §§ 802(6) and (17); 21 U.S.C. §§ 812, Schedule II(a)(4); 21 U.S.C. § 846; NY. Penal Law, § 220.09 subs. 1; N.Y. Pub. Health Law § 3306, Schedule II(b)(4). It is clear, therefore, that the respondent was removable under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act.
 
The respondent contends that Mr. Duke should have contested removability because his certificate of disposition conviction documents indicate that he was convicted under New York Penal Law § 220.09.00, but § 220.09 does not include a subsection “00”, that the respondent did not admit to possessing crack cocaine, and the transcript of the plea agreement was not properly admitted. We disagree. The certificate of disposition indictment indicates that the respondent was convicted under § 220.09, not § 220.09.00. Further, the transcript of the plea agreement, which was admissible, clearly indicates that the respondent’s amended conviction was for crack cocaine under § 220.09 subsection 1 (Gp. Exh. 8, Transcript). See Shepard v. U.S., 544 U.S. 13, 16 (2005)(court may examine, inter alia, transcript of plea colloquy); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41.¿FN3º The transcript of the plea agreement was marked as evidence, and treated as admitted since the Immigration Judge relied on it in reaching his decision, and neither Mr. Nelson nor the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) objected.
 
*3 It is unclear, moreover, why current counsel is challenging the Immigration Judge’s reliance on the transcript of the plea agreement. Without it, the record of proceeding would include two convictions for controlled substances-a certificate of disposition conviction for attempted criminal possession, as well as for attempted criminal sale, because the certificate regarding the conviction for attempted criminal possession does not indicate that it amended the attempted criminal sale conviction. Moreover, the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in immigration proceedings, but to the extent such rules apply, the transcript’s authenticity cannot be questioned at this time because there is no question that the transcript of the plea agreement is what it was purported to be-the transcript of the respondent’s original plea and conviction for attempted criminal sale, his sentencing, and his amended conviction.¿FN4º Accordingly, the respondent has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by Mr. Duke’s alleged ineffectiveness regarding removability.
 
Since the respondent was removable under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, he was not eligible to adjust his status because there was no waiver available for inadmissability under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, except for simple possession of a small amount of marihuana, see section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), and, accordingly, the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice. With regard to voluntary departure, the respondent was not eligible for such relief while the proceeding was pending before the Immigration Judge. See section 240B(b)(l)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(1)(B); section 101(f)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)(3). Further, at that time, he was not represented by Mr. Duke, and there is no claim of ineffective assistance pending against Mr. Nelson.
 
Regarding the respondent’s argument that Mr. Duke failed to pursue naturalization once the respondent became eligible, the respondent has also not demonstrated prejudice. It is fundamental that Immigration Judges and the Board do not have the authority to determine whether an alien in proceedings is prima facie eligible for naturalization for purposes of terminating proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1239.2(f). See Matter of Hidalgo, 24 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2007)(Because the Board of Immigration Appeals and the Immigration Judges lack jurisdiction to adjudicate applications for naturalization, removal proceedings may only be terminated pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1239.2(f) where the DHS has presented an affirmative communication attesting to an alien’s prima facie eligibility for naturalization.). See also Matter of Cruz, 15 I&N Dec. 236 (BIA 1975). An applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that he has been a person of good moral character, and the DHS may consider conduct and behavior beyond the statutorily prescribed period. 8 C.F.R. § 316.10. The respondent filed his application for naturalization with DHS on or about November 30, 2007. As of today’s date, the respondent has not presented evidence that he has obtained an affirmative communication attesting to his prima facie eligibility from the DHS, and, therefore, cannot demonstrate prejudice. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

Footnotes

1

We note that the Immigration Judge did not consider whether the conviction was amended for substantive or procedural defects in the underlying conviction unrelated to an immigration purpose, see Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003), and the respondent did not submit any evidence (as opposed to argument by counsel) as to why the conviction was amended.

2

We note, in this regard, that Mr. Duke was still licensed to practice law in the state of New Jersey, although it is unclear why state reciprocity provisions were not invoked. We further note that Mr. Duke did not notify either the Board or the Immigration Judge that he had been disbarred in New York, even though the Notice of Appearance forms request such information. In January 2008, Mr. Duke was suspended from practicing before the Board or Immigration Courts.

3

During his initial plea, the respondent identified the drug in question as “crack”. The trial court then asked if “that crack cocaine had an aggregate weight of more than an eight of an ounce, is that true?”, and the respondent answered “Yes.”

4

Further, the Immigration Judge considered the transcript of the plea agreement on remand while Mr. Nelson, not Mr. Duke, represented him, and the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, or otherwise demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel regarding Mr. Nelson.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)º - Convicted of crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision dated April 1, 2008. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed any opposition to the respondent’s current motion, and we therefore deem the current motion to be unopposed. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g). The motion is denied.
 
A motion to reconsider requires an assertion by the moving party that the original decision be reexamined in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. See generally Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 404 (BIA 1991); 8C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Initially, we note that in support of his motion, the respondent has cited cases arising outside the Eleventh Circuit. However, this Board historically follows a court’s precedent in cases arising in that circuit. See Matter of Olivares, 23 I&N Dec. 148, 149 (BIA 2001), citing Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25, 31 (BIA 1989). Thus, the cases cited by the respondent arising outside the Eleventh Circuit are not controlling.
 
In the instant case, the respondent has failed to present additional legal arguments which could not have been made during our earlier review of this matter on April 1, 2008. Additionally, the respondent appears to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, a petitioner attempting to reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must at least “substantially” comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (setting forth the requirements a respondent must meet in order to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel). See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir. 2003). In the instant matter, the respondent has failed to do so. The respondent has not identified any change in the law affecting his appeal nor has he identified an aspect which we overlooked during our prior review on April 1, 2008. Having considered the respondent’s contentions, we are not persuaded to disturb our decision dated April 1, 2008, for the reasons stated therein.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondents, natives and citizens of Brazil, appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision of September 20, 2006. We will accept this appeal by certification pursuant to our authority in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c). See generally Matter of Liadov, 23 I&N Dec. 999 (BIA 2006). However, the respondents* appeal will be dismissed on the merits.
 
As an initial matter, we note that the respondents have submitted new evidence on appeal, including a letter from the First Brazilian Baptist Church of South Florida dated October 2005, a pamphlet from the Community Blood Centers of South Florida (CBCSF) indicating that Elaine Hernandez, who is of unknown relation to the respondents, gave blood on October 24, 2006, and two printouts from a Florida Department of State website (www.sunbiz.org) relating to Paint by Manny and Prachel Painting and Waterproofing.
 
This Board is an appellate body whose function is to review, not to create, a record. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984). Accordingly, we cannot consider any new evidence presented for the first time on appeal, and any party asserting that this Board cannot properly resolve an appeal without further fact-finding must file a motion to remand. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). In this case, even if we construe the respondents’ submission as a motion to remand, the new evidence that the respondents seek to offer is either immaterial, as in the case of the CBCSF pamphlet, or was previously available and could have been discovered or presented at the former hearing on September 20, 2006, as in the case of the church letter and the printouts from www.sunbiz.org. See C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Accordingly, we will adjudicate the appeal based upon the evidence contained in the record when it was before the Immigration Judge.
 
On appeal, the respondents argue that they received ineffective assistance of counsel from the seven attorneys who represented them at various junctures during the last 10 years. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this matter arises, in order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must establish that his or her counsel’s performance was deficient to the point that it impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing such that the alien was unable to reasonably present his or her case. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2005). In addition, the alien must establish that he or she suffered prejudice as a result of counsel’s ineffective assistance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Prejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 1274.
 
*2 In this case, the respondents have not complied with any of Lozada’s procedural requirements. They have not provided detailed affidavits setting forth the agreements that they reportedly entered into with each of their seven attorneys. They have not informed the individuals whose integrity or competence is being impugned of the allegations leveled against them and given them an opportunity to respond. Nor have they indicated whether complaints have been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. Although the respondents present a sympathetic case, they have failed entirely to comply with any of Lozada’s procedural requirements, which the Eleventh Circuit has determined are not unduly onerous. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the respondents’ appeal is dismissed, and their motion to remand is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on February 1, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. At that time, we found that the Immigration Judge appropriately denied the respondent’s morion to reopen his in absentia removal proceedings.
 
On January 24, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit remanded the respondent’s case to this Board to consider whether the respondent’s declaration of non-receipt of the hearing notice rebutted the presumption of effective service, citing Sembiring v. Gonzales, 499 F. 3d 981 (9th Cir. 2007) (unsworn written statement of non-receipt of a hearing notice may be sufficient to rebut the weaker presumption of delivery of a notice sent by regular mail). See also Salta v. INS, 314 F.3d 1076 (9th Cir. 2002). The Court also remanded the case for the Board to consider whether the respondent’s counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance was an exceptional circumstance within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1).
 
We find that such determination requires further factual findings. In view of the Court’s order, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge to address the respondent’s claim of a lack of notice of his removal hearing and ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
ORDER: The Board’s order dated February 1, 2006, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the order of the court and this opinion, and for the entry of a new decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Justin Adams
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Rescission
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed an Immigration Judge’s June 26, 2007, decision denying his motion to reopen the Immigration Judge’s April 9, 2007, decision ordering him removed in absentia. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the respondent’s appeal. The appeal is dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent avers the Immigration Judge failed to consider that he did not appear at his hearing as he was misled by his attorney (Notice of Appeal). He maintains former counsel failed to inform him that it was possible a pending motion to change venue could be denied, and the respondent was required to appear at his scheduled hearing (Resp.’s Br.). The respondent contends he had no reason to avoid his hearing, and asks that his case be reopened.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen was essentially based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. As the Immigration Judge correctly noted, the respondent did not comply with any of the requirements for such a claim, as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Such a motion should be supported by 1) an affidavit setting forth “in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken,” as well as any representations made by counsel to the alien; 2) proof that the movant has informed former counsel of the allegations in writing, as well as any response received; and 3) a statement detailing “whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not.” Id. As the respondent’s motion did not include any of the noted evidence, the Immigration Judge did not err in finding that reopening was not warranted.
 
For the respondent’s benefit, we further note it is well-established that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the respondent of his responsibility to appear, and unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988); Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 1985), aff’d, Patel v. INS, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986). A respondent should not assume that a motion for a change of venue will be granted. Matter of Rivera, supra.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: EJIRO OMOKURU
File: AXX XX8 453 - Newark, NJ
May 13, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tahir Mella, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen her removal proceedings completed by final, administrative order on February 25, 2003, when an Immigration Judge granted the respondent the privilege of voluntarily departing the United States and entered an alternate order of removal in the event that the respondent failed to depart as promised. The instant motion, filed with this Board on October 9, 2007, is the respondent’s third motion to reopen. Her prior motions to reopen were denied. The instant motion to reopen, filed with this Board on October 9, 2007, will also be denied.
 
The respondent argues that, subsequent to failing to voluntarily depart the United States as required, she received ineffective assistance from her former counsel when seeking to reopen her proceedings because he did not timely seek reopening in order that she could apply for discretionary relief from removal on the basis of her marriage to a United States citizen.¿FN1º The respondent’s motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of her former counsel is without factual and legal merit.
 
The respondent’s failure to voluntarily depart the United States as required on May 26, 2003, rendered her statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status on the basis of her marriage to a United States citizen pursuant to the operation of section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8U.S.C. § 1229c)(d). The reason for the respondent’s failure to voluntarily depart the United States as promised is irrelevant as no exception to the limitation on discretionary relief under section 240B(d) exists for failures to depart due to circumstances beyond the alien’s control. Having asserted that she would voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent could choose, for whatever reason, to not abide by her promise, but she remains subject to the consequences of her actions. See generally Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, 371 F.3d 182, 194 (4th Cir. 2004) (Noting that voluntary departure is, from beginning to end, voluntary. Even if an alien requests the relief and obtains it, the alien may later reject it by overstaying the period specified for departure. However, if the alien rejects voluntary departure in this manner, then the alien remains subject to the real consequences of that action, including a monetary penalty and subjection to the ordinary bars on subsequent relief).
 
Thus, respondent’s former counsel was not ineffective in failing to apprise the Immigration Judge and this Board of the respondent’s marriage in conjunction with the filing of her earlier motion to reopen as the respondent’s marriage was not material to the issue of reopening. The respondent could not have sought relief from removal on the basis of her marriage as she was ineligible to adjust her status on the basis of her marriage due to her failure to voluntarily depart the United States as promised. Inasmuch as the instant motion fails to establish that the respondent’s former counsel was ineffective in failing to apprise this Board of the respondent’s marriage to a United States citizen, the instant motion to reopen is appropriately denied.
 
*2 Similarly, the regulatory time limitation on seeking reopening before the Immigration Judge had already expired when the respondent first sought reopening of her removal proceeding. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).¿FN2º Thus, the respondent has failed to establish that her former attorney was ineffective in failing to file a timely motion to reopen in this matter because the instant motion does not establish that he was retained to file a motion to reopen at a time when such a motion could reasonably have been timely filed.
 
Furthermore, the instant motion is barred by both the time and number limitations on reopening set forth at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent was aware of all of the material facts raised in support of the instant motion on October 1, 2004, when this Board denied a prior motion to reopen filed by the respondent in this matter as untimely. The instant motion was filed over 3 years later. The respondent’s motion does not establish that she acted with due diligence in raising her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, her motion is also appropriately denied because it has not been filed within a reasonable time from the respondent becoming aware of the material facts raised in support of the motion.
 
In addition, the instant motion fails to establish the respondent’s prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status based upon her marriage because the respondent did not voluntarily depart the United States as required. See Section 240B(d) of the Act. She may not adjust her status under section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1225, for a period of 10 years from her failure to voluntarily depart the United States as required on May 26, 2003. Therefore, she is not prima facie eligible for the relief she is requesting should her proceedings be reopened and her motion is appropriately denied on this basis’ as well. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied because she was and is not eligible to adjust her status due to her failure to voluntarily depart the United States as promised and her former attorney did not, therefore, render ineffective assistance by failing to timely pursue reopening in order that the respondent might apply for adjustment of status on the basis of her marriage to a United States citizen.

The respondent’s motion does not allege or establish that she entered into an agreement with her former counsel to file a motion to reopen on her behalf at any time prior to her failure to voluntarily depart the United States as promised by May 26, 2003. Indeed, her complaint filed against former counsel with state disciplinary authorities sets forth events occurring in June 2003 and asserts that she “later” contacted her former attorney to discuss her deportation order and the possibility of reopening her case based upon her marriage to a United States citizen.

This Board’s decision dated October 1, 2004, indicating that any motion to reopen would have been due on or before June 29, 2004, is erroneous. This Board’s decision dated October 1, 2004, mistakenly applied the time limitation on reopening from the date of this Board’s earlier decision upholding the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s first motion to reopen. The time limitation on reopening does not run from an administratively final order denying reopening but, rather, from the administratively final order completing the respondent’s removal proceedings. Thus, in this case, a timely motion to reopen could only have been filed by the respondent on or before May 27, 2003. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Linda L. Walker, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision dated March 13, 2008. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent argues for the first time in an attachment to his motion for reconsideration that his failure to meet the 90-day filing period for submitting a motion to reopen was due to “wrong advice from ¿hisº previous lawyer.” He further states that he consulted the lawyer on July 17, 2007, 5 days after the Immigration Judge’s July 12 2007, decision, and was advised to “wait until ¿heº received another communication from the Immigration Office, which should arrive in about 90 days.”
 
“A motion to reconsider is a request that the Board reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked. A motion to reconsider challenges the Board’s original decision and alleges that it is defective in some regard.” Matter of O-S-G, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57 (BIA 2006) (citations omitted). To the extent that the respondent is raising a claim of ineffective assistance by his former counsel, he has failed to comply with any of the requirements for asserting such a claim outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).¿FN1º See Lara v. Trominiski, 216 F.3d 383, 389 (5th Cir. 2000) (general application of the Lozada requirements does not constitute an abuse of discretion by the Board). The respondent failed to submit an affidavit outlining in full his contacts with his prior attorney, and failed to provide his former counsel with an opportunity to respond. It is unclear what correspondence the respondent would have been waiting for after the Immigration Judge issued a final decision in this case, nor has the respondent indicated whether he was aware of, or was explained, the filing requirements for submitting a motion to reopen. Moreover, we find that the respondent could and should have addressed the timeliness issue during his appeal. While the respondent states in his motion for reconsideration, through counsel, that he just realized that an October 23, 2007, letter addressed to the Immigration Judge, which outlined his timeliness argument, was sent to the wrong address, he could and should have argued this issue in his appeal brief to the Board. We therefore find that the respondent has failed to establish a basis for equitable tolling of the statutory filing period. See Coleman v. Johnson, 148 F,3d 398, 402 (5th Cir. 1999) (“A garden variety claim of excusable neglect does not support equitable tolling.”); Davis v. Johnson, 158 D3d 806, 811 (5th Cir. 1998) (Equitable tolling is permitted only “in rare and exceptional circumstances.”). Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Edgardo Quintanilla, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Merilee Fong
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on October 11, 2005, because he failed to appear for a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on May 26, 2007, but the Immigration Judge denied it on June 8, 2007. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Notice to Appear reflects that it was served personally on the respondent on June 9, 2005. It contains the hearing notice and further states that the respondent was told in Spanish of the time and location of the hearing and of the consequences for failure to appear. The respondent indicates in his declaration that an alien smuggler subsequently took the Notice to Appear from him and told him that he could leave for California. The respondent further states in his declaration that the alien smuggler never explained his case to him or told him that he was required to appear for his hearing. He requests the Board to treat his situation as though he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel and reopen these proceedings based on exceptional circumstances. The respondent does not mention that he was warned by an immigration officer of the consequences for not appearing for his hearing.
 
A claim for reopening based on exceptional circumstances must be submitted within 180 days of the order of removal. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). Because a request for reopening based on “exceptional circumstances” was not made within 180 days of the date of the respondent’s order of removal, it is barred from consideration. The Board will not excuse the respondent from his obligation to appear for his hearing because he may have unjustifiably relied on the instruction given by an alien smuggler rather than the instruction provided in the Notice to Appear and by the immigration officer. We further do not find an exceptional situation exists herein to warrant the reopening these of proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of EI Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s November 30, 2007, decision. In that decision the Immigration Judge, inter alia, denied his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), as a matter of discretion. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.
 
The respondent alleges ineffective assistance by former counsel as, although the family told the former counsel that a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder had been made and requested that the counsel obtain the respondent’s medical records, his former counsel failed to do so. It is asserted that respondent’s former counsel clearly did not understand the significance of these medical records as he told the family that these records would not be helpful. We note that in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), we laid out the requirements that a respondent must meet in order to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. First, the motion should be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent attesting to the relevant facts. Second, before the allegation is presented to the Board, the former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond. Any subsequent response from counsel, or report of counsel’s failure to respond, should be submitted with the motion. Finally, if it is asserted that prior counsel’s handling of the case involved a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, the motion should reflect “whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not.” Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997).We note that the United States Court of Appeal for the Fourth Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this matter arises, in Stewart v. INS, 181 F.3d 587, 596 (4th Cir. 1999), declined to consider an alien’s argument of ineffective assistance of counsel where the alien failed to provide an affidavit detailing his agreement with counsel, failed to inform counsel of the allegation against him or her and provide him or her with opportunity to respond, and failed to indicate whether the complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities.
 
*2 Here, the respondent, after delineating the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, indicated that affidavits have been submitted from the respondent’s brother and father attesting, on behalf of the respondent, to the relevant facts. In the brother’s affidavit, he indicated that a complaint had been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation and the respondent’s current counsel related that he had attempted to contact respondent’s former counsel to advise him of the charges against him. The respondent’s father related that he was involved in retaining the former counsel to represent the respondent and paid some of the fees, but never saw a written contract. While the respondent has attempted to comply with the Lozada requirements, to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at a deportation proceeding, an alien must show not only ineffective representation, but also prejudice to him which occurred as a result of that ineffectiveness. See Figeroa v. INS, 886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir. 1989).
 
In the instant case the respondent has presented medical evidence indicating that in August 2007 he underwent a psychiatric evaluation, resulting in several psychiatric diagnoses, and that he had been receiving treatment for a period of time. He argues that his then current attorney failed to present this evidence at his removal hearing. The respondent’s brother has provided a statement detailing a conversation with the prior attorney describing the information the brother provided to the attorney, and the attorney’s judgment that the medical evidence would not help the respondent. After noting that he was at the removal hearing but was not asked to testify, the respondent’s brother detailed the information relevant to the respondent’s mental health he would have provided. The Board notes that, in closing arguments before the Immigration Judge, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) pointed to the respondent’s contention that he had been diagnosed with a bipolar disorder which might explain his criminal history, but that there was no evidence in the record (Tr. at 136). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s claim of a bipolar disorder was not credible, noting the lack of corroboration, including the lack of evidence that he had ever being formally evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist (I.J. at 5). While the respondent’s attorney had indicated that he had attempted to talk to a physician at the facility where the respondent had been held (Tr. at 136), there is no indication that a written request for the respondent’s medical records was made.
 
We conclude that the respondent, by reason of his former counsel’s apparent failure to request and submit the respondent’s medical records into evidence, has demonstrated that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, we find that the respondent was prejudiced, particularly in light of fact that this lack of corroboration caused the Immigration Judge to call the respondent’s credibility into question.
 
*3 Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, and the removal proceedings will be remanded for further consideration of the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal, to include, if desired, the submission of additional evidence by the parties.
 
The following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eric Avazian, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Piepmeier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In an order dated June 20, 1994, an Immigration Judge determined that the respondent was removable as charged but granted the respondent the privilege of voluntarily departing the United States at his own expense on or before December 20, 1994, or any extension granted by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (now part of the Department of Homeland Security). The Immigration Judg further ordered that, if the respondent failed to depart as required, the grant of voluntary departure would be withdrawn without further notice or proceeding and an order of deportation to Syria would become effective immediately. The record establishes that the respondent was advised orally and in writing of the limitations of discretionary relief that would result from any failure by the respondent to voluntarily depart the United States as he promised. In this regard, the respondent was expressly informed that he would be ineligible to adjust his status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255, for a period of five years from the date of his scheduled departure if he did not voluntarily depart as promised. The respondent did not appeal the Immigration Judge’s June 20, 1994, order.
 
Subsequently, the respondent sought reopening which was denied and the respondent’s appeal from the denial of reopening was dismissed by this Board. The respondent’s proceedings have never been reopened since the Immigration Judge’s June 20, 1994, order. The record further establishes that, in conjunction with the denial of reopening, a final administrative order has been entered concluding that the respondent failed to establish exceptional circumstances for failing to voluntarily depart the United States as promised by February 9, 1995, the date by which he was required to voluntarily depart the United States pursuant to the extension granted by the district director of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service. In this regard, it has already been determined by this Board in a decision dated July 13, 2000, that the respondent’s failure to voluntarily depart as required resulted in his ineligibility for specified relief for a period of five years from February 9, 1995. See Matter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996), aff’d Shaar v. INS, 141 F.3d 953, 955(9th Cir. 1998).
 
Against this procedural history, we consider the respondent’s claim in support of the instant motion to reopen that his prior attorneys rendered ineffective assistance in this matter by not seeking a joint motion to reopen with the former Immigration and Naturalization Service based upon the respondent’s marriage to a lawful permanent resident of the United States on July 15, 1997, the filing of an immigrant visa petition on his behalf by his lawful permanent resident spouse on October 15, 1997, and the naturalization of his spouse on September 24, 1999. The respondent contends that, because it is the policy of the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“DHS”), to join in a motion where the respondent is eligible to adjust status, his former counsels were ineffective by not approaching the DHS about joining in a motion to reopen. However, this Board does not find that either counsel’s performance was so deficient as to constitute ineffective assistance.
 
*2 The respondent was ineligible for adjustment of status due to his failure to voluntarily depart the United States as required when he married his spouse, when an immigrant visa petition was filed on his behalf, and when his spouse became a naturalized United States citizen. Failing to pursue a joint motion to reopen with the former Immigration and Naturalization Service during the time period when he was statutorily barred from adjustment of status due to his failure to voluntarily depart the United States was not ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Furthermore, the respondent has not established through the presentation of evidence that the DHS must join in a motion to reopen in order to seek discretionary relief from removal filed over 5 years after an alien has abused the immigration process by failing to voluntarily depart the United States as required, particularly where such motion is based upon a marriage entered into years after the alien’s abuse of the immigration process. In this regard, on February 9, 2000, when the limitation on discretionary relief expired, the respondent’s deportation proceedings had been closed for over 6 years and an Immigration Judge, in a decision dated August 8, 1996, had already indicated that, even if the respondent were statutorily eligible for discretionary relief from removal, the respondent would not merit a favorable exercise of discretion because he gained his eligibility for relief by ignoring his promise to depart the United States.
 
Ineffective assistance of counsel in a removal proceedings is a denial of due process if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case. See Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1985). In any case presenting an ineffectiveness claim, the performance inquiry must be whether counsel’s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984). Methods of case presentation are within counsel’s professional judgment and are afforded great deference. See Strickland v. Washington, supra at 688-89. Strategic decisions, such as whether to call a particular witness at the hearing, rest upon the sound professional judgment of the lawyer. Gustave v. United States, 627 F.2d 901, 904 (9th Cir. 1980). Such appropriately informed strategic decisions are virtually unchallengeable. See Strickland v. Washington, supra at 690.
 
Failing to approach the former Immigration and Naturalization Service or the current DHS about exercising prosecutorial discretion to join in an untimely motion to reopen where the former Immigration and Naturalization Service had already demonstrated opposition to reopening because of the respondent’s failure to voluntarily depart the United States as required, and where an Immigration Judge had denied reopening in the exercise of discretion, was not ineffective assistance because it was reasonable considering all the circumstances. Individuals who abuse the immigration process by failing to depart as required are ordinarily undeserving of a favorable exercise of discretion. See generally Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985).
 
*3 In addition, the instant motion is untimely under the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s reliance on the doctrine of equitable tolling is misplaced. The instant motion does not establish that he acted with due diligence in filing the instant motion. Therefore, he has not established that equitable tolling of the time and number limitations on his motion to reopen is applicable.
 
Finally, due to the respondent’s abuse of the immigration process by failing to voluntarily depart the United States as required, the instant motion to reopen is denied in the exercise of this Board’s discretion and this Board declines to reopen on this Board’s own authority in order that the respondent may pursue discretionary relief from removal based upon a marriage entered into after the respondent abused the immigration process as a means of furthering his presence in the United States. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); INS v. Rios-Pineda, 471 U.S. 444 (1985).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raymond Lo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent is a native and citizen of the People’s Republic of China. She was ordered removed from the United States on April 6, 2007, because she failed to appear for a hearing. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on May 3, 2007. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on May 17, 2007, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that she was not adequately notified of the hearing. We consider that she was personally served with the Notice to Appear on October 29, 2004. It advised her of the obligation to report her current address to the Immigration Court. The Immigration Court on March 15, 2007, mailed the Notice of Hearing to the respondent at 724 60th Street, Apartment 1R, Brooklyn, New York 11220. That address appears on the Form I-830, and former counsel David Bredin, confirms the address in his Notice of Appearance filed with the Immigration Court on May 3, 2007. The record contains the respondent’s affidavit provided on appeal. Therein, the respondent indicates she has resided since August 2005 at 4613 South Clearview Drive, Camphill, PA. There is no evidence of the respondent notifying the Immigration Court of such address. The respondent further indicates in her affidavit that her intention was to use as her mailing address her cousin’s address which is the aforementioned 60th Street address. She states that her cousin received the respondent’s Notice of Hearing on April 13, 2007, after the April 6, 2007, hearing. The record also contains the respondent’s affidavit that was submitted with her motion to reopen. It infers that the respondent resided at 724 60fh Street when the hearing notice was mailed. The respondent’s cousin provided an affidavit. The cousin indicates that the respondent did reside at 724 60th Street during that period. The cousin makes no mention of having received the respondent’s hearing notice on April 13, 2007.
 
We recognize that an alien has a lesser burden of rebutting the presumption of receipt of a hearing notice sent via regular mail than had it been sent certified. See Alrefae v. Chertoff, 471 F.3d 353 (2nd Cir. 2006); Lopes v. Gonzales, 468 F.3d 81 (2nd Cir. 2006). Here, however, the respondent has provided conflicting accounts regarding whether the Notice of Hearing was received. The respondent indicates in her first affidavit that it was not received. Her later affidavit indicates it was received by her cousin on a date after the hearing. The respondent’s cousin does not corroborate either allegation made the respondent. We therefore conclude from the conflicting evidence provided that the respondent has failed to rebut the presumption that she received the Notice of Hearing.
 
*2 We have considered that the respondent’s former counsel indicates that he was not notified of the respondent’s hearing. However, former counsel submitted his Notice of Appearance after the respondent was ordered removed from the United States in absentia. Former counsel was therefore not entitled to notification from the Immigration Court of the respondent’s hearing. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985).
 
The respondent further argues on appeal that she was the victim of negligence committed by her former counsel, David Bredin. See Yang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133 (2nd Cir. 2007) (discussing that an alien must substantially comply with the procedural requirements for proving attorney negligence). The respondent has not filed a complaint against former counsel with an appropriate disciplinary authority. She also has not clearly shown whether she notified former counsel of the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. Current counsel indicates that he sent former counsel a letter asking him for a response. A copy of that letter was not provided. We therefore cannot determine whether former counsel was given an opportunity to respond to a specific allegation of attorney negligence. The procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel have therefore not been fulfilled.
 
In addition, the respondent does not indicate when she hired David Bredin to represent her in removal proceedings. She only mentions in her affidavit that she hired an individual named Hui Dong on December 12, 2004. We therefore cannot determine whether David Bredin had agreed to be the respondent’s attorney in removal proceedings prior to the mailing of the Notice of Hearing. It is possible that former counsel may only have been the respondent’s representative before the DHS. The record contains an affirmation from David Bredin dated August 6, 2007. He indicates that he was retained by the respondent, but he doesn’t say when he was retained. He further states that he filed a motion to change venue on behalf of the respondent. The record does not contain such motion. It is therefore unclear as to what former counsel has referred to. The respondent has the burden of proving that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The evidence provided is conflicting and confusing, and such does not clearly show that the respondent missed her hearing on account of the negligence of counsel.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: FITZGERALD ALPHONSO SANCHEZ
File: AXX XX4 772 - Los Angeles, CA
April 24, 2008
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Justin W. Chaney, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Piepmeier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on January 24, 2008. The final administrative order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on March 26, 1992. The pending motion was filed well over a decade late. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent argues, alternatively, that the Board did not properly mail a copy of its 1992 decision to his prior counsel, or that his prior counsel failed to properly mail a copy of the decision to him. Inasmuch as the record indicates that the Board properly served its decision on the respondent’s attorney of record, we will address his alternative ineffective assistance of counsel argument. The respondent, through current counsel, claims that former counsel told him that “as long as he does not receive a bag and baggage letter then everything was ok”, and that he did not hear anything more until he was detained by DHS in 2007. He also indicates, in his brief, that his prior attorney was supposed to file an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In support of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent has submitted, inter alia, a copy of a letter that he wrote to his former counsel indicating that he would be filing a complaint with the state bar if this Board determines that the 1992 decision was properly served; he further submits a letter from his prior counsel indicating that his office has no information on the respondent because office policy mandates that closed cases are held for seven years after which time all information in the case is shredded.
 
There is an inadequate basis for tolling the motion to reopen period in this case. See Valeriano v. Gonzales, 474 F.3d 669, 673 (9th Cir. 2007); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003) (individual seeking to rely upon “equitable tolling” of a filing deadline must show that he has acted with due diligence). Despite his claims against former counsel, the respondent fails to demonstrate why he waited so long to contact new counsel and file the pending motion. As the DHS states in its response, the respondent has not provided any reasonable explanation as to why he did not inquire about the status of his case with either his attorney or the Board during the past 15 years. Moreover, even were the motions deadline tolled in this case, the motion would be denied for failure to show prejudice resulting from the alleged failures of prior counsel. Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F. 3d 1182, 1189 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&NDec. 553 (BIA2003); Matter of Lozada, 19I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In order to show the required prejudice, the respondent must show “plausible grounds for relief.” Serrano v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 1317,1319 (9th Cir. 2006). The respondent has failed to make this showing. The respondent had a full and fair hearing on his application for section 212(c) relief before the Immigration Judge, and the Board considered all the relevant factors before finding that the Immigration Judge had correctly concluded that a favorable exercise of discretion was unwarranted in the respondent’s case. The motion is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kuyomars Golparvar
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION; Cancellation of removal
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Thailand, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 9, 2008. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on March 7, 1995. On October 26, 2006, the respondent was convicted in two separate cases (F04901939-9 and F06903726-8) for possession of methamphetamine in violation of section 11377(a) of the California Health and Safety Code.
 
We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is removable as charged under section 237 (a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), as an individual convicted of offenses relating to a controlled substance. The respondent conceded that he was removable on this basis at the hearing (Tr. 23). The charge is supported by conviction records which show that the respondent pleaded guilty to illegal possession of methamphetamine, as set forth above.
 
We have thoroughly reviewed of the transcript of proceedings and the evidentiary record. We are satisfied that the respondent received a full and fair hearing in this matter.
 
We find no merit in the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We note initially that the respondent has failed to comply in any measure with the procedural requirements for such claims set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (compliance with Lozada, supra, is generally required to assert claim of ineffective assistance of counsel). We find no evidence in the transcript of proceedings that the respondent’s former attorney, Ms. Monika Sud-Devaraj, who was substituted for the respondent’s initial counsel and represented him at his master calendar and merits hearings, was negligent in her representation. We find no indication that the respondent had any difficulty communicating with Ms. Sud-Devaraj, and we note that the court provided a Thai interpreter at the respondent’s merits hearing. The Board does not have the authority to review the respondent’s custody status in these proceedings, as bond and removal proceedings are separate and apart. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(d). However, we note that it would not have been improper for Ms. Sud-Devaraj to withdraw a pending request for bond because the respondent’s drug conviction made him subject to mandatory detention. See section 236(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c). We do not find that any action or inaction of former counsel in this matter resulted in prejudice.¿FN1º See Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000) (alien must show that the allegedly ineffective representation may have affected the outcome of the case); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 We are satisfied that the Immigration Judge thoroughly considered the record and properly weighed the adverse factors evidencing the respondent’s undesirability as a permanent resident against the social and humane considerations presented on behalf of the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal (I.J. at 4-8). See Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998). We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny this relief in the exercise of discretion.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

No prejudice resulted from the failure of the respondent’s initial counsel to appear for a master calendar hearing (Brief at 6). The Immigration Judge simply reset the hearing for another date.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Andrew L. Friedman, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 This case was last before us on December 27, 2005, when we adopted and affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 27, 2004, denying the respondents’ applications for termination and ordering their removal. A motion to reopen was filed on November 9, 2007. The motion will be denied.
 
The female lead respondent filed the instant motion to reopen these proceedings based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion will be denied because it was not filed within the statutory and regulatory 90-day time limit for filing a motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
However, because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether this case warrants equitable tolling of the time limits on motions to reopen. See Mahmood v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 248, 250 (3rd Cir. 2005)(equitable tolling of the 90-day motions deadline requires a showing of due diligence). The instant motion, filed after the issuance of a final administrative order, is based on prior counsel’s alleged failure to request a continuance at the original hearing because the respondent’s mother had a pending application for adjustment of status which, when granted, would enable the respondent to file for a waiver of the ground of deportation owing to her mother’s status as a lawful permanent resident. See section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act. 8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(1)(H). The respondent’s mother became a lawful permanent resident in October 2004.
 
The respondent’s statement does not indicate when she first found out about her counsel’s alleged error. However, the decision of the Immigration Judge correctly states the law as to the waiver’s requirements and such was read from the bench on August 27, 2004 (I.J. at 12). Additionally, the respondent retained another attorney for purposes of filing an appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and consequently had the opportunity to seek legal advice on this issue.
 
When ineffective assistance of counsel is cited to excuse a missed filing deadline, a respondent who seeks equitable tolling bears the burden of demonstrating her own due diligence for any period in which the ineffective assistance is, or should have been, discovered by a reasonable person. In the respondent’s situation, we need not determine precisely when the ineffectiveness of the respondent’s original counsel was or should have been discovered by a reasonable person in her situation as it is sufficient to observe that a reasonable person would have taken some action to attempt to place before the Immigration Judge or this Board the change in the status of her mother. We note that the respondent could have filed a motion to reopen to this Board while her petition was before the Court of Appeals. Finally, we note that there is no explanation why the respondent waited almost 2 years to file the motion. For these reasons, the respondent’s claim fails for lack of diligence in investigating and bringing the claim.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This matter was last before the Board on February 5, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the entry of a removal order. The Board had previously sustained the DHS’s appeal of the grant of section 212(c) relief. The respondent now moves to reopen to pursue adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition. The motion to reopen will be granted.
 
The respondent wants to pursue adjustment of status, and moves for reopening on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. A motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days after entry of the final administrative decision in the case. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent argues that this time period should be equitably tolled because he was unaware of his former counsel’s ineffectiveness until counsel realized in August 2007 that the respondent had been eligible for adjustment of status, and advised the respondent to consult with other counsel. The respondent did so, and new counsel filed this motion to reopen in September 2007, less than 90 days after the respondent learned of his former counsel’s error. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the respondent acted diligently and is entitled to equitable tolling of the time period for filing a motion to reopen. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 898 (9th Cir. 2003) (attorney misconduct may warrant equitable tolling until alien met with new counsel and discovered former counsel’s fraud).
 
Typically, to warrant reopening based on the ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must comply with the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10(1st Cir. 1988), and demonstrate that he was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance. The Ninth Circuit has held that the failure to comply with the Lozada requirements will not bar consideration of the motion where ineffective assistance of counsel is clear from the record. Granados-Oseguera v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 993, 998 (9th Cir. 2006). “Lozada is intended to ensure both that an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). The record of the proceedings themselves may be adequate to serve those functions. Id (holding that ineffectiveness was clear on the face of the record where counsel failed to file application for relief).
 
*2 Here, the record sufficiently reveals the ineffectiveness of the respondent’s former counsel in failing to seek adjustment of status. It is apparent from the record that the respondent is eligible for adjustment of status. His wife is a United States citi2en and has been throughout these proceedings. They were married long before the commencement of these proceedings. Although the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, that conviction does not render him inadmissible because of the petty offense exception. Section 212(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II) of the Act, 8US.C. § 1182(aX2)(A)(ii)(II). The respondent’s crime was charged as a misdemeanor punishable by not more than 1 year of imprisonment, and he was sentenced to only 60 days in jail. See Cal. Penal Code § 264(a) (Deering 1991); Exh. 2. We are not persuaded by the DHS’s argument that the respondent’s conviction bars him from a favorable exercise of discretion. The exercise of discretion requires a balancing of all favorable and adverse factors.
 
The respondent thus appears prima facie eligible for adjustment of status. There is no tactical reason why counsel would have declined to pursue such relief. The Board’s August 30, 2005, order which found the respondent ineligible for section 212(c) relief remanded the record to the Immigration Judge “for further proceedings” including a removal order “as warranted.” It thus left open the possibility of pursuit of adjustment of status at that time.
 
Under these circumstances, counsel’s ineffectiveness is apparent on the record. Thus, under controlling Ninth Circuit law, the Lozada requirements are satisfied. Prejudice is also apparent on the record, as the respondent is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status and was prevented from pursuing that relief. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra, at 527 n. 12. The respondent has submitted an application for adjustment of status and supporting documentation along with his motion to reopen. We conclude that the respondent met his burden of showing that reopening is warranted. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be granted.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mario Ninfo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Removability; cancellation of removal; suspension of deportation
 
*1 The respondent has appealed an August 29, 2006, Immigration Judge’s order finding her removable, and ineligible for relief from removal. In doing so, the Immigration Judge noted the respondent had not filed for any relief. The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the respondent admitted the truth of the factual allegations and charges of removability (Tr. at 16).¿FN1º On appeal she does not allege any error in this regard. Rather, she contends the Immigration Judge erred in finding her removable as an aggravated felon (Resp.’s Br. at 4-5). However, the Immigration Judge made no such finding. Rather, as noted, she admitted removability as charged under sections 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) and (II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), (II) (Exh. 1). We similarly find no merit to the respondent’s generalized allegation that she was afforded ineffective assistance of counsel by an unidentified individual in an unknown manner (Notice of Appeal). The respondent has in no manner complied with the requirements enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) for such a claim. To the extent she contends counsel who represented her in her criminal proceedings provided her with ineffective assistance, such a claim is in the nature of a collateral attack on her conviction (Resp.’s Br. at 5-6). However, neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board can entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to determine the guilt or innocence of the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996); Matter of Fortis, 14 I&N Dec. 576, 577 (BIA 1974).
 
While the respondent suggests she should be permitted to seek suspension of deportation, such relief is not available to her as she is in removal proceedings. Section 240A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b (Resp.’s Br. at 7-8). The respondent also avers she is eligible for cancellation of removal (Tr. at 7-8). However, she admittedly was convicted of manufacture/delivery of more than 2,000 but less than 5,000 grams of marijuana, and was sentenced to serve 60 days in jail and 24 months probation (Resp.’s Br. at 4; Exh. 1). Section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act defines an aggravated felony as “illicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substance Act (“CSA”)), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18, United States Code).” Illicit trafficking in a controlled substance is commonly defined as an unlawful trading or dealing in a controlled substance. See Matter of Davis, 20 I&N Dec. 536, 540-41 (BIA 1992). Further, section 924(c)(2) of Title 18 defines a drug trafficking crime as “any felony punishable under the CSA.” See Lopez v. Gonzales, 127 S.Ct. 625, 631 (2006). Pursuant to Lopez, supra, a state offense constitutes a “felony punishable under the ¿CSAº” only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law. Id. at 633.
 
*2 The respondent’s conviction may therefore qualify as an aggravated felony under section 101 (a)(43)(B) of the Act, as the transfer of such quantity of marijuana is punishable as a felony under the CSA. See 21 U.S.C. §§ 802(8), (11) (including in the CSA definition of distribution “the actual, constructive, or attempted transfer of a controlled substance”), 812(c) (listing marijuana as a controlled substance), 841 (a)(1), (b)(1)(D) (punishing distribution of marijuana as a felony under the CSA). See also Lopez v. Gonzales, supra at 633 (analyzing the term “drug trafficking crime” included in section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, and holding “that a state offense constitutes a ‘felony punishable under the ¿CSAº’ only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law”).
 
Consequently, the evidence of record “indicates” that a ground for mandatory denial of the respondent’s cancellation of removal application - specifically, a conviction for an aggravated felony - “may apply.” See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). The respondent therefore bears the burden of establishing that her conviction for delivery of marijuana does not qualify as an aggravated felony, Id. The respondent has not submitted any evidence to meet this burden, and thus has failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the mandatory ground of denial enumerated at section 240A(a)(3) of the Act does not bar her from obtaining cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act. Based on the foregoing, we find that the respondent has failed to establish statutory eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, and we therefore find no support for the respondent’s contention she is eligible for cancellation of removal, and, further, no basis for remand of the instant proceedings.¿FN2º We recognize that the respondent has cited a variety of humanitarian factors that she wishes to have considered in our adjudication of her claim. However, while compelling, these factors relate to relief in the form of cancellation of removal, a form of relief for which she is ineligible.
 
In closing, we find no support for the respondent’s various allegations of constitutional infirmity in her removal proceedings (Resp.’s Br. at 4-7). We are not unsympathetic to the situation faced by the respondent. However, it is well-settled that this Board cannot entertain constitutional challenges to the statutes we administer. See Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1035 (BIA 1 999). In sum, we find no error by the Immigration Judge in finding the respondent ineligible for relief.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.¿FN3º

1

Therefore, and in light of the fact that the respondent’s ineligibility for relief was established on the pleadings, we find no error by the immigration Judge in issuing a summary order. See Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999).

2

The issue of whether the DHS conclusively established that the respondent has been convicted of an aggravated felony is immaterial to our disposition of the instant appeal, as it is uncontested that the respondent is removable as charged, and the respondent bears the burden of proving that she has not been convicted of an aggravated felony for purposes of establishing eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act. As noted, that burden has not been met.

3

For the respondent’s benefit we note she appears to suggest on appeal that her conviction be vacated on the merits of the underlying criminal procedures, such as noncompliance with any associated requirement that a defendant be informed of the immigration consequences of the conviction, rather than simply for immigration purposes. See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). Unless and until this occurs, her conviction is considered final for purposes of our review. However, should her conviction be thusly vacated, she should file a motion to reopen with this Board and, if the same is untimely filed, seek sua sponte reopening of the proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert D. Kolken, Esquire
*1 APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has filed a motion to reopen and remand the record of his removal proceedings to the Immigration Judge, so that he may pursue an application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255. He is married to a United States citizen who has filed a visa petition on his behalf. See Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002) (stating that motion may be granted notwithstanding the pendency of the visa petition). The motion to reopen will be granted, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
Although this motion is untimely, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel previously and he has, substantially, complied with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir 1988). See Vang v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133 (2d Cir. 2007). In this regard, we note that he had filed for a visa petition based on his current marriage previous to our final decision in this case. The brief previous to our final decision, however, only asked that we consider his appeal regarding a pending employment visa petition and one filed by his father. At that time, had the Board been properly notified, a remand would have been appropriate. See Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002).
 
While the Board is concerned that well over 3 years have passed since the visa petition was filed and the respondent has submitted no indiction of its current status, we will, nonetheless, reopen the proceedings. We note that the Department of Homeland Security has not indicated any opposition to the current motion. At the reopened proceedings, it will be incumbent upon the respondent to demonstrate the current status of the petition and the likelihood of its success. The Immigration Judge may then consider the totality of the circumstances in deciding how best to proceed. The following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º -Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Removability, motion to terminate proceedings
 
The respondent, a lawful permanent resident who is a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals an Immigration Judge’s January 9 and 18, 2007, decisions that found him removable as charged under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act based on an attempt to smuggle an alien into the United States. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We reject the respondent’s arguments on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in granting the Department of Homeland Security’s (hereinafter “DHS”) motion to change venue and that his concession of the charge should be withdrawn due to ineffective assistance of counsel and his own confusion when listening to the Immigration Judge and the interpreter. The respondent does not challenge the Immigration Judge’s factual findings below. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Moreover, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s legal conclusions for the reasons and bases stated by the Immigration Judge. See I.J. at 2-4 (Jan. 9, 2007), at 2-3 (Jan. 18, 2007). See also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(ii) (providing that the Board may review questions of law in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo). Furthermore, the Immigration Judge considered whether the DHS had met its burden of proof to establish the respondent’s removability finding that the evidence contained in the Form 1-213 was sufficient. See I.J. at 4. Cf. Mendez-Gutierrez v. Gonzales, 340 F.3d 865, 868-70 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that the Board is required to consider an alien’s claim of a well-founded fear of future persecution prior to denying his request for reinstatement of his voluntarily withdrawn asylum application). See also Ramiro Cruz Espinoza v. INS, 45 F.3d 308 (9th Cir. 1995) (ruling that a properly authenticated Form I-213 is probative regarding issues of entry into the United States).
 
Regarding the respondent’s argument that due to the complicated nature of his case he was entitled to a heightened right to counsel, we find no error on the part of the Immigration Judge in this matter. We note that an alien has a right to counsel, but the United States Government is not required to provide counsel. See section 240(b)(4)(A) of the Act. The Immigration Judge allowed the respondent’s former counsel to withdraw with the consent of the respondent. See Tr. at 11. Thereafter, the respondent was advised of his right to counsel and given an opportunity for a continuance to find new counsel to represent him, an opportunity that the respondent declined.¿FN1º See Tr. at 12-14, 34. See also section 239(b) of the Act. In fact, the Immigration Judge afforded the respondent an opportunity at the hearing on February 23, 2006, to obtain counsel and provided him a list of pro bono attorneys, even after the respondent had indicated he wished to represent himself. See Tr. at 17. The respondent decided to continue to act pro se even after the Immigration Judge informed him of his rights. See Tr. at 12-14, 33-34. We find that the Immigration Judge fully complied with his duty to inform the respondent of his right to counsel and to provide him with an opportunity to acquire such counsel. See Jacinto v. INS, 208 F.3d 725 (9th Cir. 2000) (ruling that due process requires an Immigration Judge to inform an alien of their right to counsel and right to present evidence). There is no legal requirement that an Immigration Judge insist that an alien obtain counsel because his case is viewed as complicated, and an Immigration Judge insisting on such action would violate the alien’s right to act pro se before an Immigration Court.
 
*2 Furthermore, the Immigration Judge repeatedly inquired if the respondent understood the rights and procedures explained to him, to which the respondent consistently answered in the affirmative. In addition, the Immigration Judge willingly answered all questions posed by the respondent in order to clarify the procedures of the hearing and his rights. Based on this evidence, we find that the respondent has not demonstrated that he suffered prejudice by acting pro se. Id at 735.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note that in addition to explaining the respondent’s right to counsel, the Immigration Judge also explained to the respondent his right to review evidence presented by the DHS, the right to object to such evidence, the right to present evidence and witnesses, the right to cross-examine witnesses, and the right to appeal the Immigration Judge’s rulings and decision. See Tr. at 12-14, 34, 37. In fact, the respondent was given an opportunity to submit a corrected Form 1-213 to address what he claimed were misrepresentations of his interview. See Tr. at 20-21, 36. When DHS counsel submitted a Form 1-261 with additional charges, the Immigration Judge explained the meaning of this form and the evidence attached to it to the respondent. See Tr. at 24-26. The Immigration Judge also informed the respondent he could submit evidence to rebut the DHS allegations and explained to him his legal options for cancellation of removal. See Tr. at 30. See Jacinto, supra.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Houman Varzandeh, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand; section 212(c) waiver
 
*1 The respondent has filed an appeal from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated September 28, 2006, in which the Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal and further found that his applications for relief from removal were abandoned. The respondent has also moved to remand the record for further proceedings on the basis that his former attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the respondent claims that his former attorney, Rita Mahdessian, failed to timely file the appropriate application for relief from removal, falsely advised the respondent that she had complied with the filing and other requirements set forth by the Immigration Judge, and failed to advise the respondent that she was suspended from the practice of law at the time she initially provided him with legal counsel. We have no indication in the record before us that the Department of Homeland Security opposes the respondent’s motion to remand. The motion is therefore deemed unopposed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The motion will be granted.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640.
 
The respondent has complied with the technical requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, and his former attorney has not disputed his allegations. Additionally, the record suggests that the respondent is eligible to be considered for the relief he seeks, a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (Tr. at 9). Accordingly, we find the respondent has established ineffective assistance of counsel. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that attorney’s failure to timely file a suspension of deportation application was negligence); see also Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893 (9th Cir. 2008) (alien need not demonstrate she would win on claim absent deficient performance of counsel).
 
*2 Accordingly, we will remand the record for further proceedings on the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eugene Khavinson, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; Reopening
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Armenia. This matter was last before us on November 30, 2007, when we dismissed her appeal of the Immigration Judge’s April 21, 2006, decision ordering her removal. We found no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s application for adjustment of status based on her failure to adduce clear and convincing evidence of the bona fides of her marriage to a United States citizen (I.J. at 2-3). See Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002). We also found that the Immigration Judge did not err in refusing to accept such evidence on the day of the hearing or grant a continuance, as the respondent had over 3 months to submit documentation within 10 days of the hearing and failed to exercise due diligence (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. Presently before the Board is a motion to reconsider our decision and a separate motion to reopen based on based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The motions are denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must specify the asserted errors in the prior Board decision and be supported by relevant authority. Section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing procedural requirements for motions to reconsider). A motion to reconsider challenges the Board’s original decision as defective in some respect, based on the previous factual record. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402-03 (BIA 1991). The filing of a motion to reconsider is not a process through which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief submitted on appeal and seek reconsideration by generally alleging error in the Board’s prior decision. Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 58. The movant must specify the factual and legal issues raised on appeal that were erroneously decided or overlooked in our initial decision, or show how a change in the law materially affects the prior decision. Id.
 
Here, the respondent has not complied with these standards. To the extent that she has alleged general error in our prior decision, this is not a proper basis for a motion to reconsider. See id. The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge failed to comply with his duty to establish the record. See section 240(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(1); Yang v. McElroy, 277 F.3d 158, 162 (2d Cir. 2002). However, we are not persuaded that we erroneously overlooked this issue in our prior decision, at which time the respondent was represented by her former counsel Alexander Lumelsky, Esquire. While an Immigration Judge has an obligation to establish the record, it is the respondent’s burden to establish her eligibility for the relief of adjustment of status. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). We reaffirm our holding that the Immigration Judge acted reasonably and within his discretion in affording the respondent 3 months to marshal the evidence necessary to support her claim, and denying a continuance when she failed to do so. The absence of any evidence of the bona fides of the respondent’s marriage was not a result of the Immigration Judge’s failure to develop the record, but of the respondent’s failure to exercise due diligence in satisfying her burden of proof. Therefore, the motion to reconsider is denied.
 
*2 Concerning the motion to reopen, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), in which we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The claimant must also establish prejudice resulting from his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that the alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
In this case, the respondent has not complied with the first prong of Matter of Lozada. While her supporting documentation contains two personal unsworn statements, neither of these is an “affidavit.” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (8th ed. 2004). Furthermore, she has not set forth in detail the agreement entered into with Mr. Lumelsky concerning the actions to be taken and what representations he did or did not make in this regard. In fact, a letter from Mr. Lumelsky in the respondent’s documentation informs her that “¿aºs we discussed, you must provide me with evidence of your life together with your husband from the date of your marriage until the hearing,” and “if I do not receive any documentation from you and your husband by March 1, 2005, I will withdraw as your attorney.” The letter further instructs the respondent to file a motion with the Immigration Court with “your Philadelphia attorney” if she desired to have venue transferred to Philadelphia. These representations call into doubt the respondent’s assertion that Mr. Lumelsky told her that she could either bring the required evidence 10 days before the hearing or to the hearing itself. Moreover, the respondent has provided no evidence of prejudice, as required to prevail on the instant motion. The respondent has raised no argument concerning her eligibility for adjustment of status in her motions and the only evidence of record tending to establish the bona fides of her marriage was submitted by Mr. Lumelsky in connection with the appeal. As this evidence is outdated, it is insufficient to show a bona fide marriage and thus demonstrate prejudice. For these reasons, the motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel is denied.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motions are denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Luisito Lopez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Terry M. Louie
Senior Litigation Counsel
 
CHARGE:
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on January 22, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen in absentia proceedings. In doing so, the Board found the respondent had received appropriate notice of his hearing. On December 14, 2007, the respondent submitted a “motion to reconsider,” asking the Board to sua sponte reopen proceedings as he avers he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion is denied.
 
We initially note the respondent’s motion is incorrectly titled, as its true nature is one seeking reopening.¿FN1º A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based on the previous factual record, as opposed to a motion to reopen, which seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 403 (BIA 1991); see also section 240(c)(7)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) and Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Here, the respondent does not allege the Board committed error based on the record before us at the time of our prior decision. Rather, he contends prior counsel afforded him ineffective assistance by failing to include with his first motion to reopen the original envelope for his hearing notice, although he had given the same to her. With his motion he has provided evidence he did not previously submit, including affidavits from himself and a former landlady, and a March 5, 2007, letter from former counsel.
 
The respondent’s motion is time-barred as it was filed more than 90 days after the Board’s decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Moreover, as the Department of Homeland Security notes in its opposition, the respondent has not complied with any of the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). We appreciate that former counsel indicated in her letter that the respondent had “exhausted the appeals,” however without further inquiry it is unclear whether she referred to his available appeals within the administrative system, whether he had exhausted the level of appeals available pursuant to their representation agreement, or if she truly did not appreciate he could appeal to the federal circuit court. As the respondent did not inform former counsel of his allegations against her, she has had no opportunity to clarify what she meant in her letter. Former counsel’s mistaken referral to a “motion to reconsider” when discussing the requirements for a motion to reopen is also not per se evidence of ineffective assistance. As noted, current counsel has made a similar such mistake. Moreover, there is no indication that a motion to reconsider was supportable at that time as, to date, the respondent has not demonstrated the Board committed any error in our prior decision¿FN2º. Similarly, the respondent has not indicated he had informed Ms. Baquero he had any “additional information” which would have supported a motion to reopen. As such, although her reference to the nature of the motion was in error, he has not shown he had provided her with evidence supporting a second motion to reopen.¿FN3º Since the respondent has not informed Ms. Baquero of his allegations against her, he has not afforded her an opportunity to respond to his claim that he, in fact, provided her with the envelope bearing the hearing notice and she failed to file the same with his motion. Ms. Baquero’s letter makes no reference to this document. Without more, the respondent has not shown he was provided with ineffective assistance of counsel, and reopening is not warranted.¿FN4º
 
*2 In closing, we do not find that the facts presented represent exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of our sua sponte authority to reopen. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (Board retains limited discretionary power under the regulations to reopen or reconsider only in exceptional circumstances); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). In addition, we decline to exercise our discretionary authority to reopen as the record demonstrates the respondent was ordered excluded in 1995, and admitted he reentered the United States in 1996 without lawful authorization (Forms I-213, I-831). He also admitted departing and returning to this country several times thereafter, also without lawful authorization. Moreover, the record contains evidence indicating he was involved in the unlawful smuggling of two aliens into the United States (Forms I-213, I-831; Minn. Dept. of Public Safety, Field Report, 1/5/06). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

1

This error is ironic given that current counsel, who submitted the erroneously titled motion before us, cites as evidence of prior counsel’s incompetence her mistaken reference to a “motion to reconsider” when stating the requirements for a motion to reopen.

2

The respondent does not contend he never received notice. Rather, he avers the same was untimely delivered to his then-residence (Motion at 5-7).

3

We observe the respondent and his landlady’s affidavits are not “new” evidence as they could have been previously provided. He has not explained why he did not file the same with his first motion.

4

The respondent also has not provided details regarding why it took so long for him to file the instant motion (almost eleven months after the Board’s decision). In his affidavit he merely states he “retained” instant counsel, without identifying when he first contacted Mr. Lopez, and what efforts he undertook during the more than ten intervening months following the Board’s decision and prior to the submission of the motion at issue.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Desmond P. FitzGerald, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)º - Conditional resident status terminated
 
  
APPLICATION: Waiver under section 212(c)(4); remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals from the January 8, 2008, decision of the Immigration Judge denying her motion to reconsider. The Immigration Judge initially ordered the respondent removed on July 27, 2007, After the respondent failed to submit proof to the court that she had filed a Form 1-751, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had abandoned any available relief and ordered the respondent removed to Lithuania.¿FN1º The respondent moved to reopen, arguing that her prior counsel had been ineffective in failing to timely file the Form 1-751. The Immigration Judge denied that motion on December 20, 2007, because the respondent failed to submit proof that she had filed the 1-751, had not met the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel set out in Mailer of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), and was not eligible to adjust her status based on her marriage to her current husband. The respondent then filed a motion to reconsider before the Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reconsider Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reconsider on January 8, 2008, finding that she had not identified any defects in the prior decision. It is from that decision that the respondent now appeals.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that she did not abandon her application for relief, that she has met the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, and that she is eligible to petition for a hardship waiver pursuant to section 216(c)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4). The DHS has not submitted a brief in this case.
 
A motion to reconsider requests that the original decision be reexamined in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2) (2007) a (“motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s prior decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority”).
 
Preliminarily, the record establishes that the respondent has met the requirements set out in Matter of Lozada, supra, for ineffective assistance of counsel claims (Attachments to Respondent’s January 7, 2008 Motion to Reconsider). In addition, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent could not adjust her status based on her current marriage to a United States citizen because she entered the United States on a fiance visa based on her engagement to her first husband. The Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits the adjustment of status from a fiance visa under section 101(a)(l 5)(K), except as a result of a marriage to the same the citizen who filed the fiance petition. Section 245(d) of the Act. The record does not contain evidence that the respondent entered the United States with a fiance visa, but if that is the case, then the Immigration Judge’s ruling regarding adjustment of status is correct.
 
*2 In her motions to reopen and to reconsider, however, the respondent does not seek adjustment of status through her current husband; instead, she seeks a hardship waiver to remove the conditional basis of her permanent resident status based on her marriage to her first United States citizen husband. See section 216(c)(4) of the Act. The Immigration Judge did not address this aspect of the respondent’s case in her December 20, 2007, decision. Accordingly, we find that a remand is appropriate for consideration of the respondent’s eligibility for any relief.
 
The record is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

Although the Immigration Judge’s July 27, 2007, summary decision indicates that the respondent was ordered removed in absentia, it appears from the record that the respondent actually appeared at the hearing.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David L. Wilson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Darrin E. Hetfield
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on November 26, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent has timely filed a motion to reopen the proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has indicated its opposition to reopening. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent seeks reopening in order to allow her to present testimony from her first husband, Anthony Toan Ly, regarding the bona fides of their former marriage. The respondent claims that she received ineffective assistance from her former attorney, who she claims rebuffed her repeated suggestions that she should contact Mr. Ly to ask him to testify on her behalf. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent asserts that Mr. Ly’s testimony will validate her claim that she and Mr. Ly married for love, and not in order to circumvent the immigration laws, and that the termination of the marriage was through no fault of her own. The respondent has proffered affidavits from herself as well as Mr. Ly.
 
Pursuant to the Board’s holding in Matter of Lozada, supra, the respondent informed former counsel of the allegations made against him. In a letter written in response to the respondent’s allegations, former counsel states that he did in fact ask the respondent to provide Mr. Ly’s address and whereabouts to his office from the beginning of the proceeding. However, the respondent never provided the address but stated that Mr. Ly had gone to Canada with another woman.
 
We find that reopening is unwarranted. The respondent has not shown that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent’s contention that former counsel rejected her suggestions to procure Mr. Ly’s testimony is unworthy of belief in view of the many inconsistencies between the respondent’s affidavit and that of Mr. Ly; the inconsistencies between the affidavits and the testimony given by the respondent under oath at the January 31, 2006, hearing; and former counsel’s statement that he had asked the respondent to provide Mr. Ly’s address, but she did not do so.
 
The respondent states in her affidavit that she told her attorney on at least two occasions prior to the January 2006 hearing that she believed Mr. Ly would be willing to appear in court to testify on her behalf. However, this conflicts with the respondent’s testimony that she does not want to contact Mr. Ly because she knows that he lives with another woman in Canada, and she does not think that he would come to court and explain what happened to their relationship if she did contact him (Tr. at 59). Additionally, the respondent’s statement in her affidavit that Mr. Ly’s mother had told her she had Mr. Ly’s telephone number after the respondent called her following the first master calendar hearing conflicts with the respondent’s testimony that she does not know where to find Mr. Ly and was only told that he lived with “that woman” in Canada when she telephoned his friend (Tr. at 58-59).
 
*2 Mr. Ly’s affidavit also conflicts with the respondent’s testimony as well as her affidavit. Mr. Ly states that he had contact with the respondent from time to time, and she had told him that “she had an interview and later that she had court”. He further states that he wrote a letter to the respondent’s former counsel and would have gone to her hearing, but the respondent explained that former counsel did not want her there. These statements are inconsistent both with the respondent’s January 31, 2006, testimony that she had not talked to Mr. Ly since December 1999 and did not know where to find him (Tr. at 58) and with the allegations in her affidavit that she was given Mr. Ly’s telephone number by his mother, and subsequently telephoned him and told him of her situation, only after the Immigration Judge entered his order granting her voluntary departure.
 
The letter from former counsel in response to the allegations made against him as well as the respondent’s testimony suggest that the respondent herself made the decision not to procure the testimony of her former husband at proceedings below and then regretted that decision after the Immigration Judge rendered his decision. We do not find that the respondent’s former counsel provided ineffective assistance, nor do we find that the respondent’s proffer constitutes material new evidence which was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the hearing below. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Therefore, the respondent has not met the regulatory requirements for reopening.
 
Finally, it appears that Mr. Ly’s testimony would not have bolstered the respondent’s claims regarding the bona fides of her former marriage but would only have further undermined them. Mr. Ly’s statement that he and the respondent began arguing “¿iºn the spring season of 2000” is inconsistent with the respondent’s January 2006 testimony that she last talked with Mr. Ly in December 1999. Additionally, Mr. Ly’s statement that the respondent’s sister began telling her that he was messing around with the sister’s female employee, whom he had been talking to since early 2000, is inconsistent with the respondent’s testimony that her brother and sister had told her of the woman in June 1999 and that Mr. Ly had met her prior to the respondent’s February 1999 arrival in the United States (Tr. at 54-55).
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brenda C. Diaz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Catherine Halliday-Roberts
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Continuance
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent’s timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 2, 2008, finding the respondent removable, as charged, based on the respondent’s admissions and concessions of removability (Tr. at 14) as to his 2006 California receiving of stolen property conviction, which he found to be an aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(G)of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G); finding he had not demonstrated his eligibility for any for relief from removal (Tr. at 15), and ordering his removal to Mexico, will be dismissed.
 
The only issue raised on appeal is the respondent’s contention that his former attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to request a continuance from the Immigration Court while concomitantly pursuing a post-conviction motion to set aside and vacate the respondent’s 2006 California receiving of stolen property conviction, which underpins the charges of removability, and his eligibility for relief from removal.
 
We find no merit to the contentions raised by the respondent on appeal. To the extent the respondent alleges ineffective assistance by former counsel, we note that in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), we laid out the requirements that a respondent must meet in order to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Here, the respondent has failed to comply with any of the established requirements to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Moreover, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice as a result of the alleged ineffective assistance of former counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra. The record reflects the respondent’s former attorney, after considering the respondent’s entire criminal record which included two probation violations with additional time beyond the original 365 days of his sentence, indicated to the Immigration Judge that, in her professional judgement, it would not be fruitful to pursue any post-conviction relief in this case (Tr. at 15). The respondent has presented no arguments on appeal that would challenge that assessment. We recognize that the present case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has held that rigid adherence to the procedural requirements established in Lozada is not always necessary. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir 2000). However, where the respondent has failed to comply with any of the Lozada requirements and where the respondent has also failed to show any prejudice, we are compelled to deny his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Assaad, supra.
 
*2 Moreover, the decision to grant or deny a continuance is in the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown. See Matter of Luviano-Rodriguez, 21 I&N Dec. 235, 237 (BIA 1996); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). That decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing. See Matter of Luviano-Rodriguez, supra at 237; Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec.433 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.6. There is no indication in the record that the respondent was denied a full and fair hearing. An Immigration Judge presented with a facially valid charge of removability need not hold removal proceedings in abeyance based on the mere possibility that a collateral criminal proceeding could have a future impact on the alien’s immigration status. See Contreras v. Schiltgen, 122 F.3d 30, 33-34 (9th Cir. 1997), affd on add’l grounds in Contreras v. Schiltgen, 151 F.3d 906 (9th Cir.1998) (Contreras II) (the court found that the “validity of ¿the alien’sº California conviction can only be tested in an action against the state, which has the greatest interest in preserving its judgment and the best ability to either correct or defend it … and … ¿uºntil ¿the alienº has successfully overturned his conviction in such a proceeding, the ¿Immigration Judgeº is entitled to rely on the conviction as a basis for custody and eventual deportation.”).
 
The respondent raises no arguments on appeal which were not addressed by the Immigration Judge or which would cause us to reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision. Based on the record before us, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is subject to removal from the United States, as charged, based on the respondent’s concessions of removability (Tr. at 14). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c) (2007). Moreover, the respondent has failed to establish his eligibility for any relief from removal. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: MARIA SACARIAS DE PINEDO

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio Salazar, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Olga El-Bogdadi
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated December 20, 2007, which dismissed her appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act as a lawful permanent resident, and denied a motion to remand based on allegations of ineffective assistance of former counsel. In so doing, we found that the respondent not only failed to meet any of the requirements for properly asserting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, but also did not show that she had been actually prejudiced by ineffective assistance. The motion to reopen is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security.
 
The respondent claims that reopening is warranted as she received ineffective assistance of former counsel before the Immigration Judge. A party who seeks to reopen proceedings to pursue relief previously considered bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated that an inquiry into whether counsel provided ineffective assistance must begin by determining whether competent counsel would have acted otherwise before examining whether an alien was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective actions of counsel. See Maravilla-Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9 th Cir. 2004). Counsel’s actions must have rendered the proceedings fundamentally unfair such that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting her case. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003). In addition, “substantial prejudice” must be established and such prejudice means that an alien must show that the alleged ineffectiveness affected the outcome of proceedings. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, supra; Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241,1246 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
In support of reopening, the respondent submits a sworn personal declaration and indicates that a copy of the motion and declaration were being sent to her former attorney to allow him an opportunity to respond. However, the respondent has not established that she notified the former counsel of the allegations made against him and gave him an opportunity to respond. Also, the respondent has not indicated whether she filed a bar complaint against former counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Compliance with the Lozada requirements is not optional where there is not an obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel on the record. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598-99 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent continues to assert that had her case been properly prepared and presented the Immigration Judge would have granted the relief she sought. However, the respondent, who asserts that her United States citizen children should have been called as witnesses, has not shown what testimony they would have presented or that it would have affected the outcome of the proceedings. Similarly, she has not shown how additional preparation would have altered the adverse credibility finding below. Consequently, we find that the respondent has not established that any alleged ineffective assistance she may have received caused substantial prejudice. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Leonel Torres, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Angela A. Crider
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before the Board on January 27, 2005, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen. We found that the respondent received proper notice of her hearing and she failed to establish exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear. On May 18, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen before the Board. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
In her motion, the respondent requests that the Board consider the additional facts and evidence supporting the respondent’s claim that she did not receive proper notice of the hearing. The respondent contends that there was improper notice because the address listed on the Notification Requirement for Change of Address lists the wrong address for the respondent, and the transcript of the Immigration Judge’s decision also indicates an incorrect address for the respondent.
 
The respondent is correct that the Notification Requirement for Change of Address (Form I-830) lists an incorrect apartment number for the respondent, and the transcript of the January 29, 2001, proceedings reflects a typographical error regarding the respondent’s apartment number.¿FN1º Tr. at 2. However, both of these errors are harmless and irrelevant, as the notice of hearing dated November 15, 2000, was sent to the respondent at the most recent address she provided. The record reflects that on November 1, 2000, the respondent filed a motion to change venue, indicating that she resided at 7500 Plum Creek Apt. #4237, Houston, TX 77012. On November 14, 2000, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s motion to change venue. The order was sent to the respondent at the Plum Creek address, but it was returned to the Houston Immigration Court as undeliverable. Furthermore, on November 15, 2000, the Houston Immigration Court sent a notice of hearing to the respondent at the following address: C/O Elvis Tsikis, 7500 Plum Creek Apt. #4237, Houston, TX 77012. The envelope was returned to the Immigration Court with the handwritten notation “MLNA.” The respondent failed to appear for the hearing on January 29, 2001, and was ordered removed in absentia. The in absentia order also was returned to the Houston Immigration Court with a label indicating “No Forward Order On File - Unable to Forward - Return to Sender.” The Immigration Judge indicated that the notation “MLNA” is customary to reflect “moved, left no address.” See I.J. Dec, dated October 17, 2003, at 2.
 
In her prior motion before the Immigration Court, the respondent claimed that in February 2001, she moved to a new address: 5825 Delaney Rd., #603, Hitchcock, Texas 77563. However, the record contains a Biographic Information Form (Form G-325), dated September 27, 2002, indicating that she began residing at that address in October 2000. Furthermore, the Immigration Judge’s order granting the change of venue motion, the hearing notice dated November 15, 2000, and the in absentia order dated January 29, 2001, were all returned to the Houston Immigration Court as undeliverable, and all of the returned envelopes indicated that the respondent had moved and left no forwarding address. This raises the question whether the respondent moved prior to November 2000, but failed to inform the Immigration Court immediately of her change of address, as required. The respondent received proper notice of her hearing, as it was mailed to the most recent address provided by the respondent and she failed to keep the Immigration Court apprised of her correct address.
 
*2 The respondent now claims for the first time that she failed to appear for her hearing due to ineffective assistance of counsel. She asserts that her prior counsel failed to notify her regarding the transfer of venue and the hearing on January 29, 2001. The respondent states that her prior counsel only provided her with a hearing notice dated September 20, 2000, for a hearing on March 30, 2001. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the alien has satisfied the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent has not complied with any of the requirements set forth in Lozada. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joyce A. Phipps, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jorge A. Ramos
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration and reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, from Ecuador, moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider and reopen¿FN1º our decision. On May 26, 1994, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent deported in absentia when she failed to appear at a hearing. On March 8, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied a motion to reopen. On April 14, 2006, we dismissed the appeal of the denied motion to reopen. On November 2, 2007, we denied a motion to reopen which raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel and requested equitable tolling for the time limits on motions to reopen. The instant motion will be denied.
 
In our April 14, 2006, decision, we specifically agreed with the Immigration Judge that the respondent had not established that she failed to appear at the hearing before the Immigration Judge due to lack of notice or other exceptional circumstances. In our November 2, 2007, decision, we concluded that the respondent’s argument that the time limits on motions to reopen should be equitably tolled must fail because, during the nearly 10 year period between the Immigration Judge decision and the filing of the first motion, the respondent had not acted with due diligence. See Boakai v. Gonzales, 447 F.3d 1, 3 n.3 (1st Cir. 2006); Jobe v. INS, 238 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2001); Cai Xing Chen v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 151, 154, n 3 (1st Cir. 2005).
 
The instant motion now claims that the respondent was told by 3 attorneys to wait instead of pursuing her case. However, the previous motion filed with the Board complained only about Attorney Manzo, who first represented the respondent while these proceedings were pending. There was no specific complaint alleged or substantiated with regard to the Attorney Napolitano, who filed the motion before the Immigration Judge and represented the respondent on appeal, or with regard to any other counsel.
 
There is no adequate explanation in the instant motion as to why allegations of ineffectiveness were not made against all of the prior attorneys, rather than just the first attorney, in the earlier motion. No evidence of compliance with the procedural or substantive requirements to establish ineffective assistance of counsel claims against any of these other attorneys has been provided. See Lawrence v. Gonzales, 446 F.3d 221, 226 (1st Cir. 2006); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 A motion to reconsider must include the following: (1) an allegation of material factual or legal errors in the prior decision that is supported by pertinent authority; (2) in the case of an affirmance without opinion (“AWO”), a showing that the alleged errors and legal arguments were previously raised on appeal and a statement explaining how the Board erred in affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision under the AWO regulations; and (3) if there has been a change in law, a reference to the relevant statute, regulation, or precedent and an explanation of how the outcome of the Board’s decision is materially affected by the change. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
Insofar as the motion requests reconsideration of our April 14, 2006, decision on appeal, the motion was not filed until November 30, 2007. The motion is untimely and does not establish an exception. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Insofar as the motion requests reconsideration of our November 2, 2007, decision, the argument in the motion merely disagrees with our conclusion, but does not establish errors of fact or law supported by pertinent authority, or cite to changed law, that would warrant granting the motion. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra. Insofar as the motion attempts to argue new facts, these are not substantiated by any objective evidence. Furthermore, the respondent does not explain why these facts were not introduced in the earlier motion to reopen denied by the Board. 8 C.F.R § 1003.2(c). Accordingly, the motion is denied. The request for a stay is also denied.

Joyce A. Bakke
Senior Attorney
*1 This case is presently before the Board pursuant to an order issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The order granted the government’s unopposed motion to remand this matter to the Board of Immigration Appeals.
 
On June 2, 2006, the Board summarily affirmed the December 6, 2005, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge determined that the court lacked jurisdiction to reopen the respondent’s deportation proceedings because the respondent departed the United States in December 2003, after a final order of deportation was entered against him on December 23, 1997. The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent failed to demonstrate lack of proper notice of his deportation hearing, and he failed to establish exceptional circumstances due to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
On January 9, 2008, the Department of Homeland Security filed a motion to remand, requesting that the matter be remanded to the Immigration Judge for an analysis consistent with the intervening applicable case of Lin v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2007). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The Board’s June 2, 2006, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s December 6, 2005, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on April 16, 2007, when we ordered the respondent removed from the United States as an alien convicted of an “aggravated felony,” inter alia, on the basis of her multiple New York State convictions for possession of crack cocaine. The respondent now moves for reconsideration and reopening, arguing that our prior decision misapplied controlling circuit law and was based on an erroneous determination that her September 2002 conviction was “final” as of the date when she committed her 2003 drug possession offense. The respondent also contends that she received ineffective assistance from the accredited representative who acted as her advocate before the Immigration Judge and this Board. The motion will be denied.
 
According to the United States Supreme Court, “state possession crimes that correspond to felony violations of ¿the CSAº, such as … recidivist possession, clearly fall within the ¿aggravated felony definitionº.” Lopez v. Gonzales, 127 S. Ct. 625, 630 n.6 (2006). To determine whether such a correspondence exists in a particular case, we look first to decisional authority from the Supreme Court and the controlling Federal circuit court of appeals. Matter of Carachuri-Rosendo, 24 I&N Dec. 382, 385 (BIA 2007). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this proceeding arises, has held in a precedent decision that a defendant’s 1993 New York offense of fourth-degree criminal possession of marijuana, committed after his two 1992 convictions for criminal sale of marijuana had become final, qualified as an aggravated felony “because that offense would have been punishable as a felony under ¿21 U.S.C. § 844(a)º,” which authorizes a maximum sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment for a simple possession offense if the offender “commits such offense after a prior conviction … for any drug, narcotic, or chemical offense chargeable under the law of any State, has become final.” United States v. Simpson, 319 F.3d 81, 85-86 & n.6 (2d Cir. 2002); see also United States v. Mohammed, No. 06-CR-106S, 2007 WL 1959227, *2-3 (W.D.N.Y. July 2, 2007) (following United States v. Simpson, supra, as controlling authority on the “recidivist possession” issue) (not reported in F. Supp.2d).
 
The Simpson court’s treatment of the “recidivist possession” issue is consistent with Lopez and construes the identical federal criminal statutes-18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and 21 U.S.C. § 844(a)—that we construe here. We recognize that the Simpson court purported to limit its holding to cases arising in the sentencing context; however, the Supreme Court has since made clear that we cannot give identical criminal statutes different meanings in immigration cases than they have in criminal cases. Matter of Carachuri-Rosendo, supra, at 385 (quoting in part Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 11 n.8 (2004) (explaining that, if a statute has criminal applications, “the rule of lenity applies” to the Court’s interpretation of the statute even in immigration cases “¿bºecause we must interpret the statute consistently, whether we encounter its application in a criminal or noncriminal context”)). Thus, United States v. Simpson, supra, is controlling in these proceedings.¿FN1º
 
*2 In our prior decision, we concluded that the respondent’s February 2003 conviction for possession of crack cocaine was an aggravated felony under United States v. Simpson, supra, by virtue of its correspondence to “recidivist possession,” and the respondent’s motion does not persuade us that we committed any legal or factual error in arriving at that conclusion. As the language of 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) makes clear, a drug possession offense is “punishable” as a Federal felony (that is, by a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year) if it was committed after a “prior conviction” for a “drug, narcotic, or chemical offense” had become “final.” Applying this statutory language to the facts of the respondent’s case, we now reaffirm our prior decision sustaining the aggravated felony charge.
 
The offense alleged to be an aggravated felony in these proceedings is the respondent’s February 27, 2003, violation of section 220.03 of the New York Penal Law, which defines the offense of seventh-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance. To correspond to “recidivist possession” under 21 U.S.C. § 844(a), the respondent’s commission of that offense must have been preceded by a final prior conviction for a drug, narcotic of chemical offense. The respondent was convicted in September 2002 of possession of crack cocaine, and there is no question but that cocaine possession is a “drug, narcotic, or chemical offense” under 21 U.S.C. § 844(c). Therefore, the only question remaining to be decided is whether the respondent’s 2002 conviction had become “final” as of February 27, 2003, the date when she committed the cocaine possession offense alleged to be an aggravated felony. According to the Second Circuit, “‘a prior conviction is final for purposes of recidivist sentencing when all avenues of direct appellate review have been exhausted.”’ United States v. Glen, 418 F.3d 181, 186 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Lovell, 16 F.3d 494, 497 (2d Cir. 1994)).
 
Under New York’s Criminal Procedure Law, the respondent had 30 days after entry of her September 2002 conviction to file a notice of appeal. N.Y. Crim. P. Law § 460.10(a)(1). This direct appeal period ended in October 2002, well before the date in February 2003 when she committed her subsequent drug possession offense. We recognize that after the expiration of this 30-day direct appeal period a defendant has an additional year in which to apply for leave to perfect an appeal out of time. N.Y. Crim. P. Law § 460.30(1). Indeed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has concluded that a New York conviction lacks “finality” for purposes of 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) during this additional 1-year period. Smith v. Gonzales, 468 F.3d 272, 277 (5th Cir. 2006). With all due respect, however, we do not agree with the Fifth Circuit’s analysis of this issue.¿FN2º Specifically, a motion filed pursuant to N.Y. Crim. P. Law § 460.30(1) is neither a “direct appeal” from the original judgment nor a request for issuance of a prerogative writ-such as a writ of certiorari—that can be granted in the unfettered discretion of the appellate court. Instead, N.Y. Crim. P. Law § 460.30(1) defines a procedure by which a prospective appellant may obtain equitable tolling of an already-expired appeal deadline only upon a judicial determination that the failure to perfect a timely direct appeal was due to “(a) improper conduct of a public servant or improper conduct, death or disability of the defendant’s attorney, or (b) inability of the defendant and his attorney to have communicated, in person or by mail, concerning whether an appeal should be taken, prior to the expiration of the time within which to take an appeal due to defendant’s incarceration in an institution and through no lack of due diligence or fault of the attorney or defendant.” See also People v. Corso, 40 N.Y.2d 578, 581 (N.Y. 1976). In short, a request for leave to file an untimely appeal under N.Y. Crim. P. Law § 460.30(1) is not in the nature of a “direct appeal” because it can only be granted upon proof of equitable considerations above and beyond the existence of an otherwise appealable judgment. Accordingly, we conclude that the respondent’s September 2002 conviction for possession of crack cocaine was “final” by the time she committed her subsequent cocaine possession offense in February 2003, despite the fact that the 1-year period prescribed by N.Y. Crim. P. Law § 460.30(1) had not yet elapsed.
 
*3 In conclusion, we reaffirm our prior decision, which ordered the respondent removed as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. The respondent has not persuaded us that our prior decision was either legally or factually erroneous. Furthermore, because the respondent’s 2003 conviction qualified as an aggravated felony as a matter of law, we find no prejudice arising from her accredited representative’s “failure” to argue otherwise. Accordingly, we reject the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The motion to reconsider and reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

As we noted in Matter of Carachuri-Rosendo, supra, at 388 n.4, this Board’s earlier precedent in Matter of Elgendi, 23 I&N Dec. 515 (BIA 2002) was superseded by United States v. Simpson, supra. See also Vacchio v. Ashcroft, 404 F.3d 663, 676 n.13 (2d Cir. 2005) (questioning the continued viability of Matter of Elgendi, supra); Copeland v. Ashcroft, 246 F. Supp.2d 183, 186 (W.D.N. Y. 2003) (same). We now reiterate that Matter of Elgendi, supra, lacks precedential force.

Accordingly, we shall decline to follow it in cases arising outside the Fifth Circuit.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration and reopening
 
This matter was last before the Board on November 7, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s June 8, 2006, decision denying a continuance of proceedings. The respondent now moves to reconsider and reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must be filed within 30 days of the Board’s decision and assert that the Board made a factual or legal error at the time it rendered the previous decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b) (2003); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991), aff’d, 979 F.2d 212 (11th Cir. 1992) (table case). The respondent acknowledges that his motion is untimely but notes that his former attorney did not notify him of the Board’s decision in time to seek reconsideration. Even if timely, the respondent failed to allege any legal or factual error by the Board in our prior order to support reconsideration. Thus, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
The respondent also seeks to reopen proceedings to pursue an application for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(i)ofthe Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). With respect to the new evidence submitted in conjunction with the instant motion to reopen, we find that this evidence could have been presented at the hearing before the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) (providing that a motion to reopen shall be supported by new evidence that is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented previously). The respondent argues in his motion, however, that his prior counsel “failed to investigate and submit evidence either to the IJ or BIA that Respondent is grandfathered under U.S.C. § 245(i) of the LIFE Act.” If the respondent is alleging a claim of ineffective assistance by his former counsel, he has failed to comply with any of the requirements for asserting such a claim outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637(BIA 1988).¿FN1º See Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498, 501 (7th Cir. 2001) (recognizes Board’s authority to rule and analyze cases within the Lozada framework). Moreover, regardless of the respondent’s claim of derivative status as a grandfathered alien under section 245(i) of the Act, as we noted in our prior decision, the respondent failed to present evidence that his I-130 petition has been approved or that an immigrant visa is immediately available to him. Thus, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Under Matter of Lozada, supra, a motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be supported by an affidavit, reflect whether a complaint had been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and include a response to the allegations by former counsel or report counsel’s failure or refusal to respond.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher Duran, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jesus Clemente
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated July 18, 2007, the Board of Immigration Appeals denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen and reconsider. The respondent’s motion will be granted and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen and reconsider is both untimely and number barred. The respondent requests equitable tolling based on the ineffective assistance of former counsel (Patricia Vargas). The respondent shows substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to allege ineffective assistance of former counsel. The respondent presents a detailed affidavit and a copy of the attorney complaint form filed with the California State Bar. Although the respondent did not write a letter directly to Ms. Vargas, the certificate of service for the respondent’s motion states that a copy of the motion and attachments was sent to Ms. Vargas, thus giving her an opportunity to respond to the allegations against her.
 
The respondent shows sufficient prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (holding that the alien did not establish that his former counsel’s failure to file a timely appeal constituted sufficient prejudice to warrant consideration of his late appeal on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel). The respondent offers documents (which Ms. Vargas did not present in support of the two motions she filed for the respondent) which indicate the respondent’s husband filed for legalization, her daughter filed for benefits under the Family Unity Program (FUP), and her husband received two receipts for fees paid for two FUP applications. These documents do not prove that the respondent was granted FUP status. The respondent and her husband, however, submit their respective declarations. The respondent states that she applied for derivative FUP status through her husband in 1991. The respondent’s husband states that his FUP application for his wife was granted. In Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, 298 F.3d 888, 892 (9th Cir. 2002), the court stated that facts presented in affidavits supporting a motion to reopen must be accepted as true unless inherently unbelievable. Under the circumstances present here, it is not “inherently unbelievable” that the respondent was granted FUP status. Depending on if and when FUP status was granted, when combined with the respondent’s admission as a lawful permanent resident in May of 2000, she may meet the 7 year continuous residence (after having been admitted in any status) requirement in section 240A(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(2), and thus be eligible for cancellation of removal. See Garcia-Quintero v. Gonzales, 455 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that acceptance into FUP constitutes being “admitted in any status” for the purposes of section 240A(a)(2) of the Act).
 
*2 The respondent shows due diligence. See generally Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that the limitation period may be tolled until the alien meets with new counsel to discuss his file, thereby becoming aware of the harm resulting from the misconduct of his prior representatives). The second motion by Ms. Vargas was denied on July 18, 2007. The respondent retained present counsel on July 27, 2007, filled out the attorney complaint form on August 15, 2007, executed her declaration on August 20, 2007, and filed the present motion on August 27, 2007. Due diligence has been shown.
 
On remand both parties may submit further evidence regarding whether the respondent was granted FUP status, and if so, when she was granted such status. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Valerie L. May, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Steven J. Connelly
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated January 24, 2008. In that decision, we dismissed the appeal of a denied motion to reopen an order of removal entered in absentia. The motion, inter alia, requests an opportunity to introduce further, previously unavailable, evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion claims that prior counsel suffers from dementia and is unable to practice law. The respondent claims that, as a consequence of the early onset of the disease, the prior counsel misstated the respondent’s whereabouts to the court on the date of the merits hearing, and never actually notified the respondent of the date and time of the hearing. The motion includes, inter alia, medical documentation of the prior counsel’s disability and current unsuitability to practice law.
 
These documents post-date our decision and were therefore previously unavailable. The facts in these documents would be relevant to the Immigration Judge’s conclusions with regard to the respondent’s claim that he did not receive notice of the hearing. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i), 1003.24(b)(4)(iii). The facts are material and were not considered by the Immigration Judge when adjudicating the respondent’s earlier motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c). The motion is timely filed and, as a motion to reopen an in absentia order of removal, is not subject to the number limitations on motions to reopen. Id. Consequently, the motion is granted and the matter is remanded for further proceedings, to include consideration of any applications for relief, if appropriate.
