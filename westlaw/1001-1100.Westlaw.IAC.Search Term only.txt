APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on July 24, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision finding that he did not derive citizenship through his mother or through his United States citizen stepfather, who adopted him in 1950. Our decision left in place a previous Immigration Judge decision finding the respondent removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and ordering his removal from the United States. The respondent’s petition to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, seeking review of our July 2006 decision, was dismissed.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of South Korea. He has timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s July 17, 2009, decision rejecting his motion to reopen because the Immigration Court lacked jurisdiction to consider this motion, as the Board last dismissed his appeal in July 2006. The respondent also has filed a motion to reopen with this Board, arguing that proceedings should be reopened to allow him to pursue adjustment of status though the approved visa petition filed on his behalf by his United States citizen wife. The appeal is dismissed and the motion to reopen is denied.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s factual determinations, including credibility determinations, for clear error. See United States v. National Assn. of Real Estate Boards, 339 U.S. 485, 495 (1950) (a factual finding is not “clearly erroneous” merely because there are two permissible views of the evidence). The Board reviews de novo questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We first note that we find no cause to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision that she had no jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s May 11, 2009, motion to reopen. Because the respondent had appealed the Immigration Judge’s last decision of record, jurisdiction over any subsequent motions would rest with the Board, and not the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2, 1003.23(b)(1).
 
*2 Turning to the motion to remand, the respondent claims that reopening is appropriate to assess his eligibility for “newly-acquired relief” in the form of an application for adjustment of status based on an approved visa petition filed by his United States citizen wife. See Respondent’s Brief and Motion at 6. Because the respondent’s motion was filed with the Board on September 8, 2009, it is untimely, as it was filed some 3 years after our last decision in this case, which was issued in July 2006. Generally, a motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision was rendered. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent argues that the time period for filing the motion should be tolled because his prior counsel provided ineffective assistance in (1) pursuing the argument that removal proceedings should be terminated because the respondent had derived United States citizenship through his parents, (2) failing to pursue below a challenge to the validity of the respondent’s convictions, and (3) failing to pursue below a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act. See Respondent’s Brief and Motion at 7-8.
 
While the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, under whose jurisdiction this case arises, recognizes equitable tolling of motions deadlines in ineffective assistance of counsel cases, an alien must demonstrate not only that his constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). Moreover, an alien must demonstrate substantial compliance with the general procedural requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (requiring the alien to lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative, to give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and to file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made).
 
The respondent has not shown due diligence or any attempt to comply with the Matter of Lozada requirements. In fact, the respondent entirely omits any explanation for the 3-year delay in filing a motion to reopen and claims to be exempt from meeting the Lozada requirements because the ineffective assistance of former counsel was “clear on the record.” See Respondent’s Brief and Motion at 8. As to the latter claim, we find former counsel’s decision to pursue a derivative citizenship claim—as opposed to a direct or an indirect attack on the criminal convictions and resulting grounds of removability—to be distinct from what would constitute “ineffective assistance of counsel.” Indeed, counsel’s strategic decision in this regard is not the type of conduct typically held to be “ineffective assistance.” See Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113, 127 n. 7 (BIA 1998) (citing Thorsteinsson v. INS, 724 F.2d 1365 (9th Cir. 1984)) (ineffective assistance counsel claim rejected where attorney made informed, strategic decision). In any event, such a decision would not constitute “clear” ineffective assistance obviating the need to make some attempt to comply with the Matter of Lozada, supra, requirements.
 
*3 As to due diligence, as noted above, the respondent’s motion is silent on this point. He offers no event that triggered his discovery of the alleged ineffective assistance of past counsel and does not describe his actions over the course of the 3 years that lapsed between the Board’s July 2006 decision and his first attempt to reopen proceedings before the Immigration Judge in May 2009. We note for the record that the respondent indicated that the visa petition filed by his wife was approved in August 2007. Yet since that time, the record does not reflect that the respondent did anything to pursue reopening of proceedings. In the absence of any evidence that he diligently tried to discover ineffective assistance of counsel or that he actually received any ineffective attorney advice, we decline to find that the deadline for timely filing a motion to reopen should be equitably tolled. Iturribarria v. INS, supra.
 
Finally, we note that the respondent’s motion lacks a showing of prejudice, even if we were to find that ineffective assistance of counsel occurred and that tolling was warranted because of the respondent’s diligence. That is, the respondent suffered three serious convictions, i.e., first-degree robbery, possession of a prohibited firearm, and theft. See Immigration Judge’s April 13, 2006, Order. The respondent has not shown that he is admissible to the United States, in light of these convictions, which raise the possibility that he has suffered one or more crimes involving moral turpitude. If so, his ability to secure a waiver of inadmissibility as to those convictions is doubtful, since (1) the robbery and weapons convictions were pursuant to a jury verdict, rendering him ineligible for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act, and (2) he has been found removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, rendering him ineligible for relief under section 212(h) of the Act.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cori White
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of Nicaragua, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on June 28, 2005, after failing to appear at a heating. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on May 28, 2008, arguing that a non-attorney legal representative advised her not to appear at her hearing, and the proceedings should be reopened based on “exceptional circumstances.” The Immigration Judge denied the motion as untimely on July 8, 2008. On July 30, 2009, the Board remanded the record to the Immigration Judge to consider whether it was appropriate to equitably toll the 180-day period to seek reopening.¿FN1º The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion on December 29, 2009, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The Immigration Judge found that he had no authority to equitably toll the 180-day period to file a motion to reopen based on “exceptional circumstances.” In the alternative, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not file her motion with due diligence even assuming that equitable tolling was available. In addition, the Immigration Judge declined to reopen these proceedings sua sponte.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge did not meaningfully address the equitable tolling issue and whether she filed her motion with due diligence. We disagree. The Immigration Judge addressed the issue and stated his reasons for finding that due diligence was not exercised by the respondent. We find that the Immigration Judge afforded the respondent due process while adjudicating her motion.
 
The respondent further argues on appeal that she did not know that she was a victim of ineffective assistance counsel until she retained current counsel. Presumably, the respondent requests tolling of the 180-day period to file her motion based on “exceptional circumstances” until she retained her current representative.
 
The record contains the respondent’s affidavit. Therein, she indicates that she received notice of her hearing and was told by her former representative not to appear. She further states that her former representative told her that she could later reopen her case on account of the respondent’s pregnancy. However, the respondent does not indicate in her affidavit that her former attorney told her she had an unlimited period to file her motion to reopen.
 
*2 The Board would only find it appropriate to equitably toll the 180-day period for a reasonable amount of time. A reasonable period may have been a few months after the birth of her child. We agree with the Immigration Judge that equitably tolling that period for nearly three years is not appropriate. We find on de novo review, as did the Immigration Judge, that the respondent did not exercise due diligence in maintaining her immigration status in the United States. It follows that the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion as untimely. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tahir Mella, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Shana Belyeu
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 On April 29, 2004, the Board affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision, in which the judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings, which were conducted in absentia. The Board declined to reconsider this decision on July 29, 2004, and denied a motion to reopen on November 8, 2004. Over five years later the respondent, who is from China, filed a late and number-barred motion to reopen, on February 4, 2010. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), will be denied.
 
As in previous filings, the respondent blames former attorney Joseph Muto, who has been disbarred, for her failure to appear at her removal hearing.
 
The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has stated that the motion to reopen period is “mandatory and jurisdictional”, and not subject to equitable tolling, even where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised. Abdi v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 430 F.3d 1148, 1149-50 (11th Cir. 2005); see also Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir. 1999)(concerning motion to reopen in absentia order).
 
The Board declines to reopen proceedings under its discretionary sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The respondent has already raised a claim against Muto; such claim was last rejected by the Board on November 8, 2004. No good explanation is provided as to why the pending motion, which makes similar assertions, was not filed for more than five years. The pending motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Thomas M. Bernstein
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
On March 30, 2010, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed. On April 15, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider and a motion to reopen, which the Department of Homeland Security opposed. The Immigration Judge denied the motions on April 27, 2010. The respondent, a lawful permanent resident who is a native and citizen of Jamaica, now appeals. The respondent’s request for a waiver of the appellate filing fee is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3) (2010). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent makes the same argument on appeal as in his motions to reconsider and reopen. He argues that his case should be reconsidered or reopened because (a) his counsel was ineffective; and (b) the Immigration Judge should not have considered the respondent’s New York controlled substance conviction for removal purposes because the conviction was sealed (Form EOIR-26, attached statement; Exh. 2). Based on our de novo review of the issues raised by the appeal, we see no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s ruling. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent did not demonstrate that he had new material evidence that was not available and could not have been discovered at his prior hearing. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). His assertions of ineffective assistance of counsel, and of counsel’s conflict of interest and trickery,¿FN1º are unavailing. The record does not indicate that he was represented by counsel before the Immigration Judge (I.J., dated April 27, 2010, at 2; Form EOIR-26, attached statement; Tr. at 17, 25). Additionally, the respondent did not present evidence that his controlled substance conviction was not valid for immigration purposes (I.J. at 2). Hence, the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent did not meet the standards for reopening (I.J., dated April 27, 2010, at 1-2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Similarly, the respondent did not establish that reconsideration was warranted because he did not specify any errors of law or fact in the Immigration Judge’s March 30, 2010, removal order (I.J. at 2). See section 240(c)(6) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2). As such, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reconsider. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of Guatemala, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on April 24, 2003, after failing to appear at a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on March 18, 2010, and the Immigration Judge denied it on April 13, 2010. The respondent filed a second motion to reopen on May 6, 2010. The Immigration Judge denied it on July 9, 2010, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent argues in his Notice of Appeal that “exceptional circumstances” prevented his appearance at his hearing. He states that he hired an attorney to change venue in these proceedings from Harlingen, TX, to Los Angeles, CA. The respondent indicates that he never heard from his attorney, and he did not know that he had been ordered removed from the United States in absentia until March 2010. He argues that he is a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and these proceedings should be reopened.
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had filed a number-barred motion to reopen. We agree. The regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) provides that an alien may file only one motion to seek reopening of an order of removal entered in absentia. Consequently, the respondent’s second motion to reopen is numerically-barred from consideration. It was also correctly found by the Immigration Judge to be an untimely request based on “exceptional circumstances.” See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). We further agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not satisfied the procedural requirements for a claim for reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel notwithstanding the jurisdictional bar. See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383 (5th Cir. 2001); Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying reopening of these proceedings.

Valerie Curtis-Diop, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Chanlee S. Sutoyo
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondents’ motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The final administrative order in these proceedings was entered by the Immigration Judge on March 12, 2003. The respondents thereafter filed their first motion to reopen raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which was denied by the Immigration Judge. They appealed that denial to the Board, which dismissed their appeal in October 2004. The respondents then filed their second motion to reopen raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and that motion was denied in October 2005. Their motion to reconsider that decision was also denied, in November 2006. Over 3 1/2 years later, the respondents have filed this third motion to reopen proceedings, alleging for the third time that they are victims of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion.
 
The respondents urge that the time and number limits for motions to reopen should be equitably tolled because they have been the victims of ineffective assistance of counsel both at the initial hearing and with regard to all of their subsequent motions. The motion time and number limits may be equitably tolled where an alien raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). An alien must, however, demonstrate that he has been diligent in raising the claim and must show that he has been prejudiced by counsel’s conduct. Id.; Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999) (finding that prejudice must be shown for a due process challenge and that prejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected outcome); see also Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004) (an alien can show prejudice where counsel’s performance “may have affected the outcome of the proceedings”).
 
The respondents have failed to establish that they were prejudiced in this case. They urge that they have been prejudiced because their initial counsel erroneously conceded their removability and accepted pre-conclusion voluntary departure on their behalf.¿FN1º The respondents, however, have presented no evidence that the concession of removability was unreasonable. Although they identify some arguments that possibly could have been raised to challenge the reliability of the evidence that had been received by the Immigration Court regarding the diversity visas that were alleged to have been fraudulently obtained by the respondents, and to have been subsequently revoked by the United States State Department, they have failed to demonstrate that counsel acted unreasonably in conceding removability in the face of the evidence presented by the DHS (Exhs. 2-4). Nor have they shown any likelihood that they would have prevailed in their challenges to the evidence of record, or that the outcome would have been affected if the Immigration Judge rendered a decision based on the evidence of record rather than counsel’s concession. In sum, the respondents have failed to demonstrate that they were prejudiced by their initial attorney’s actions. Consequently, we do not find that equitable tolling of the time or number limits is warranted in this case. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

All of the allegations of deficiencies in the ensuing motions raising the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel ultimately turn on whether the respondents have shown they were prejudiced by the actions of their initial counsel. If not, none of their subsequent claims prevail.

File: AXXX XX4 329 - Orlando, FL

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michaelangelo Rosario, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 15, 2009. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on November 6, 2008. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
We find that proper notice was provided to the respondent. The record reflects that the Immigration Judge reopened proceedings on a prior occasion after the respondent failed to appear. Following the Immigration Judge’s decision reopening the respondent’s case, a hearing notice scheduling the respondent’s case was mailed to the respondent’s attorney of record, Pablo Cabrera, Esquire. We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent received proper notice inasmuch as written notice of his hearing was provided to his attorney of record. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (finding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (providing that whenever a person is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to the attorney or representative of record, or to the person himself if unrepresented). On the Notice of Appeal, the respondent does not contest the Immigration Judge’s determination that notice was provided to the respondent’s former counsel.
 
To the extent that the respondent argues exceptional circumstances because his attorney did not tell him the date of his hearing after it had been reopened by the Immigration Judge, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is untimely as it was not filed within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order.

See generally Vaz Dos Reis v. Holder, 606 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2010) (stating that with respect to motions to reopen in absentia proceedings courts typically treat ineffective assistance of counsel claims as an exceptional circumstance). In sum, we find no reason to disturb the decision of the Immigration Judge.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Anwer Khan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of Guatemala, was ordered removed from the United States on February 26, 2009. Her appeal of that decision will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). We decide this appeal de novo.
 
The respondent argues in her Notice of Appeal that she was denied consideration for any form of relief from removal on account of the ineffective assistance of her former counsel. She states that she is eligible to be considered for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b. The respondent infers that the Immigration Judge would have considered or even granted her cancellation of removal had it not been for her former attorney’s negligence by not adequately preparing and filing her application. She requests a remand for a hearing.
 
The Board will not grant a request for a remand based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel unless the respondent first establishes certain requirements. In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. See also Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
In the instant case, the respondent has not submitted an affidavit or filed a complaint with the bar association against her former attorney. She has also not provided her former attorney with an opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. Based upon this lack of proof, we are unable to find that the respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements for proving that she was ineffectively represented by her former attorney in these proceedings. We will therefore not remand the record based on this particular allegation.
 
*2 The respondent further vaguely asserts in her Notice of Appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her motion to continue her February 26, 2009, hearing to complete her application for cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge noted that she had earlier continued the proceeding for that purpose from February 14, 2008, to February 26, 2009. We find for the reasons stated by the Immigration Judge that the decision denying the respondent’s motion to continue was correct. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul C. Agu, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jorge Ramos
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals the January 28, 2009, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact by an Immigration Judge under the clearly erroneous standard of review, but we may review de novo questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii) (2008); see also Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The record reflects that the respondent was granted voluntary departure on September 22, 2008, with an alternate order of removal. On January 16, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen seeking to adjust his status through his United States citizen spouse. The Immigration Judge correctly denied the motion as untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
In his motion, the respondent alluded to ineffective assistance of counsel by his former counsel. However, the respondent failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In that case, we held that ineffective assistance of counsel claims require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned is informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, where this case arises, has found the application of the noted requirements to be a necessary condition to obtain a reopening of removal proceeding on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Belte-Veloz v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 2008). Here, the respondent has failed to fulfill any of the above-noted requirements. Nor has the respondent specified how he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s representation. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 562 (BIA 2003).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent maintains that the Immigration Judge should have reopened his proceedings sua sponte. We find that the respondent’s motion does not establish an exceptional situation sufficient to warrant reopening of his removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ishrat Sami, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision issued March 11, 2010. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen because he had established good cause for a continuance of her hearing. The respondent contends that his attorney was required to attend another court hearing at the same time. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We find that the Immigration Judge’s decision to proceed with the hearing on December 9, 2009, was appropriate under the circumstances. The regulations provide that an Immigration Judge has the discretion to grant a request for continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. However, parties are obligated to appear for a scheduled hearing unless and until the Immigration Judge expressly grants a request for a continuance. See Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988). Since the Immigration Judge did not rule on the respondent’s request for a continuance, the respondent was required to appear for his hearing. See Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1996) (the filing of a motion for a continuance does not excuse an alien from failing to appear). The Immigration Judge was within her bounds to conduct proceedings in absentia.
 
Finally, we note that the respondent has not made a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F. 2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent has not established any other exceptional circumstance for his failure to appear. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX9 796 - Honolulu, HI
August 26, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Manuel Q. Diones, Esquire
*1 After the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Board, we returned the case to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings on July 31, 2009. The Board on May 24, 2010, affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision, in which the judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings, which were conducted in absentia. The respondent, who is from El Salvador, filed a motion with the Board on August 16, 2010. The motion, to which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded, will be denied.
 
The Board first considers that the respondent was removed from the United States on August 16, 2010, the same day that the motion was filed. The Ninth Circuit has held that 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) cannot be applied to cause the withdrawal of a motion filed by an alien who has been forcibly removed while the motion is pending before the Board. Coyt v. Holder, 593 F.3d 902, 907 (9th Cir. 2010). As the respondent was removed the same day that the motion was filed, the Board will assume that it retains jurisdiction over the motion, despite the respondent’s removal.
 
In the May 24, 2010, decision, we fully considered the record before determining that the respondent received adequate notice of his removal hearing, where he failed to notify the Immigration Court as to his most current mailing address. Section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(B). The Board also rejected the respondent’s claim that “exceptional circumstances” excused his failure to appear at the removal hearing. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act. Although the respondent contended that an attorney, Ronald Oldenburg, had in his possession the respondent’s address, “¿tºhe respondent … indicates his belief that he has not been a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and a claim alleging such has not been submitted to the Board.” Board’s May 24, 2010, dec., at 2. Moreover, the record did not contain an affidavit from either the respondent or Oldenburg.
 
The pending motion, in part, reargues the respondent’s contention that the Board should have sustained his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny reopening of the in absentia proceedings in this case. As such, the motion is an untimely motion to reconsider, as a motion to reconsider must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the challenged order. Section 240(c)(6) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b).
 
To the extent that the pending motion may be considered a motion to reopen, it was timely filed. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). However, a motion to reopen imposes a heavy burden on the moving party to show that reopening is warranted. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Here, the motion merely presents an affidavit from the respondent’s girlfriend, stating that she has “instituted an investigation ¿with the Hawaii Office of Disciplinary Counselº with regards to Mr. Oldenburg’s ineffective assistance of counsel leading to ¿the respondent’sº absence from his November 2, 2009, heating.” Kalio Affidavit, at § 6; Respondent’s Mot., at 5, 7-8. The affidavit does not assert that the attorney was ineffective, nor does it explain how the attorney may be responsible for the respondent missing the removal hearing. Moreover, the affidavit does not come from the respondent himself. The girlfriend’s affidavit is insufficient to properly raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against Oldenburg. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent’s pending motion will, therefore, be denied.
 
ORDER: The pending motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Turkey, moves pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen proceedings and to reissue our last decision, dated May 19, 2009. In that decision, we denied a motion to reopen as untimely. On May 22, 2008, we issued our final order in this matter, dismissing the appeal of the Immigration Judge’s January 16, 2008, decision denying a waiver under section 209(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1159(c), and also denying withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act and the Convention Against Torture. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16-18.¿FN1º On July 31, 2008, we denied a motion to reconsider. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). In removal proceedings, motions to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The present motion, filed on April 14, 2010, is untimely as it was not filed within 90 days of our May 22, 2008, final order. 8 C.F.R. § 1002.3(c). However, the respondent argues that this is due to the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). The motion will be denied.
 
The time limit on motions to reopen may be equitably tolled where the alien establishes that the respondent exercised due diligence to discover or act upon the alleged incompetence of her prior attorney in a timely manner. 8 C.F.R. §1003.2(c); Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127 (2nd Cir. 2008); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3rd 167 (2d Cir. 2006); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000). In addition, the motion must establish that the ineffective assistance caused the respondent substantial prejudice amounting to a due process violation that would warrant a tolling of the time limit in.. See Id; Romero v. INS, 399 F.3d 109, 112 (2nd Cir. 2005), citing U.S. v. Perez, 330 F.3d 97, 101 (2nd Cir. 2001); Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 The respondent argues essentially that her prior counsel, Attorney Edwin T. Gania, failed to timely file a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit of our May 19, 2009, decision denying the first motion to reopen. Attorney Gania filed petitions for review of our May 22, 2008, merits decision, and of our July 31, 2008, decision denying the motion to reconsider, which were consolidated before the Second Circuit. These petitions were denied. Yalincak v. Holder, 352 Fed.Appx. 584, 2009 WL 3739067 (C.A. 2 November 10, 2009) (unpublished) (petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc denied and mandate issued on May 21, 2010). The respondent claims that she paid Attorney Gania to file a petition for review of our May 19, 2009, decision and he failed to do so, and therefore the decision should be reissued to allow the filing of a timely petition for review.
 
The respondent also argues that Attorney Gania was ineffective by failing to file a full and accurate copy of the “Joint Appendix” (a.k.a. “Joint Appendix”) with the Second Circuit (Motion to Reopen and Motion to Reissue Pursuant to Lozada (“Motion”) at 2, 6). The respondent also argues that there is new factual evidence warranting reopening in discretion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
Regarding the first argument, that the Attorney Gania failed to file a petition for review of our May 19, 2009, decision, the motion proffers, inter alia, a February 11, 2010, letter from Attorney Gania to the respondent (Motion at Exh. 3). In the letter, the attorney admitted that he did not file a petition for review of the May 19, 2009, decision, and offered the respondent a settlement. Attorney Gania offered to waive further payment for the Petition for Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc that was pending at the Second Circuit, and to refund the money paid for the motion to reopen. Alternatively, if the respondent decided to pursue a grievance or bar complaint against the attorney’s office, the attorney would be forced to withdraw from the Second Circuit proceeding because of a conflict of interest.
 
The respondent apparently did not file a bar complaint as no evidence of a bar complaint has been proffered. Also, the Petition for Panel Rehearing and Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc (“Petition for Rehearing”) filed at the Second Circuit on February 23, 2010, indicates Attorney Gania still represents the respondent in front of the Second Circuit (Motion at Exh. 8). See also Yalincak v. Holder, supra. Therefore, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, supra. Furthermore, the respondent’s continued retention of the attorney is antithetical to the claim that the attorney provided ineffective assistance. Moreover, as discussed below, no prejudice from any alleged ineffective assistance of counsel has been shown.
 
*3 Regarding the claim that counsel failed to provide a complete copy of the “Joint Appendix” with the Second Circuit, the respondent’s Petition for Rehearing filed with the Second Circuit places the blame for this on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (see Motion at Exh. 8 Petition for Rehearing at 4-5). No ineffective assistance of counsel has been argued on this, or any other matter, before the Second Circuit, which belies the respondent’s claim before the Board that she believes Attorney Gania provided ineffective assistance before the Second Circuit, or the Board. The motion does not include arguments that could not have been raised in a timely motion to reopen or in a petition before the Second Circuit that may have warranted a different outcome in the matter. Therefore, the motion does not establish the substantial prejudice amounting to a due process violation that would warrant a tolling of the time limit in these proceedings. See Id; Romero v. INS, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra. The motion thus does not establish an exception to the time limitation on motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
Finally, the instant motion sets forth discretionary factors for consideration. These include the fact that the respondent’s husband and daughter recently became lawful permanent residents, and that the respondent and her husband are facing health issues (Motion at 16-21). However, there is no objective documentation of the medical or other discretionary factors. Notwithstanding, in consideration of all the factors involved in this matter, this case does not demonstrate an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretion to reopen these proceedings or reissue the final decision under our sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997)(stating that “¿tºhe power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen proceedings and to reissue our May 19, 2009, decision is denied.

As noted in our final decision, after having been admitted as a visitor in 1992, in 1996 the respondent was previously placed in deportation proceedings for having overstayed her visa, and also because of a September 22, 1995, conviction for practicing medicine without a license in violation of section 25-22.5-8-1 of the Indiana Code, for which she was sentenced to 8 years in prison, with 4 years suspended. On April 4, 1998, she had been granted asylum (I.J. at 3, 6; Exhs. 1, 2). The respondent was placed in these removal proceedings because of a March 19, 2007, conviction for conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, to commit wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343, for which she was sentenced to 24 months prison, 36 months supervised release, and $2,250,000 in restitution (I.J. at 10-12; Exhs. 1-4). The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was subject to removal as an aggravated felon for conspiracy to commit fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim exceeded $10,000, as defined in sections 101(a)(43)(M) and (U) of the Act (I.J. at 11-12; Exhs. 1-4). Section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Chien Yu Michael Wang, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 On July 14, 2010, the respondent, who is a native and citizen of the Philippines, filed a motion to reopen these proceedings to afford him the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, we do not restate them here except as necessary to explain our decision.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied as time and number barred. See sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§1229a(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (an alien may file one motion to reopen and, with certain exceptions not relevant here, it shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal). Our prior order in this case was issued May 2, 2008. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s first motion to reopen on February 5, 2008.
 
The respondent recognizes that his motion is untimely filed and asks us to reopen on our own motion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). In Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), we held that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship.
 
The respondent has failed to present exceptional circumstances which would support sua sponte reopening. Instead, he presents a case where enforcing the time and number limits on motions to reopen will result in hardship to the respondent and his wife. The respondent states that he has been married to his United States citizen wife for six years and she would suffer extreme hardship if he were removed from the United States. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Attachments M, N. The respondent married a United States citizen in April 2004 just after he agreed to voluntarily depart the United States. The acquisition of equities in the United States is to be expected when one continues to remain in the United States, and the respondent’s motion does not demonstrate an “exceptional” situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretion to reopen his proceedings under our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, supra. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied as time and number barred.
 
The respondent also asks us to reconsider our prior order.¿FN1º The respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied as untimely filed. See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Act (a motion to reconsider shall be filed within 30 days of the entry of a final administrative order of removal). Additionally, the respondent has not identified any error of law or fact in our prior decision or the Immigration Judge’s decision. See section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(b). See also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). He simply restates his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We considered the respondent’s arguments before rendering a decision in this case. We decline to revisit them.
 
*2 Based on the foregoing, the motion to reopen and reconsider will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and reconsider is denied.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(G)
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony as defined under section 101(a)(43)(B)
  
APPLICATION: Remand; continuance
 
The respondent timely appeals the Immigration Judge’s April 20, 2010, decision finding the respondent removable as charged under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and denying his motion for a continuance. The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his continuance request. We note that the respondent does not contest the Immigration Judge’s finding of removability and does not assert that he is eligible for any forms of relief. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) argues that the Immigration Judge’s decision is correct and should be summarily affirmed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the defense attorney who represented him during his criminal proceedings in Pennsylvania. Specifically, the respondent claims that his guilty plea was not voluntary because he was not properly advised by his lawyer that a conviction could lead to adverse immigration consequences. As the respondent notes, the United States Supreme Court has held that a criminal lawyer representing a non-citizen in connection with a guilty plea has a constitutional duty to advise the defendant that conviction may pose a risk of deportation. Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010). In light of Padilla, the respondent claims that the Immigration Judge violated his right to due process of law by failing to continue his removal proceedings while he pursued a collateral attack on his conviction in the New York courts.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not state “good cause” for a continuance. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6 (2010). A collateral attack does not impair the validity of an alien’s conviction for immigration purposes unless and until the conviction is overturned. E.g., Montilla v. INS, 926 F.2d 162, 164 (2d Cir. 1991); Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). While there may be some truly exceptional cases in which an Immigration Judge might justifiably grant a continuance during the pendency of a criminal matter, we reject the respondent’s assertion that he has a due process right to such a continuance. An Immigration Judge presented with a facially valid removal charge is not required by principles of fundamental fairness to adjourn removal proceedings every time an alien raises the speculative possibility that a collateral criminal proceeding might eventually affect the immigration case. Requiring a continuance in such contexts would invite abuse, and would often unnecessarily prolong the mandatory detention, at Government expense, of aliens with criminal convictions. See section 236(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) (requiring the DHS to detain most criminal aliens, without bond, pending the conclusion of their removal proceedings). Furthermore, it has been over 3 months since the Immigration Judge rendered his decision, yet we have received no indication that the respondent’s conviction has been vacated or materially modified in any way by the Pennsylvania courts. Under the circumstances, we have no basis for concluding that the respondent suffered substantial prejudice arising from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his continuance request.
 
*2 In conclusion, we find no error or due process violation in the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s continuance request and ordering him removed. In the event the respondent ultimately prevails on his collateral challenge, he shall of course be free to file a motion to reopen the proceedings. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7). The following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sopo Ngwa, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a second motion to reopen to rescind the in absentia order of removal that was entered against her on January 23, 2008. She does not address the fact that her motion is untimely and number-barred, but urges that reopening should be granted because she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Essentially, she urges that she failed to receive notice of the scheduled hearing in this case because her prior attorney never filed an appearance form with the Immigration Court or a notification of her change of address, and the notice of hearing was therefore served at her old address. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the current motion.
 
Having reviewed the respondent’s submissions, and in view of the unique circumstances of this case and the lack of opposition by the DHS, we find it appropriate to reopen these proceedings sua sponte and remand this matter to the Immigration Court for a new hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). There is no dispute in this case that the respondent did not actually receive the notice of hearing mailed by the Immigration Court on October 4, 2007, as it was returned by the United States Postal Service with the notation “Return to Sender.” While it is not clear whether the respondent’s prior attorney agreed to represent her with regard to her removal proceedings, she has presented persuasive evidence that she reasonably believed he was representing her both before the USCIS and the Immigration Court and that she believed he had filed an appearance on her behalf and had reported her October 2006 change of address to the Immigration Court. We are convinced of an exceptional situation that warrants reopening of these removal proceedings. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, we will reopen these proceedings sua sponte, vacate the in absentia removal order, and remand this matter for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The removal proceedings are reopened sua sponte, and the Immigration Judge’s January 23, 2008, in absentia order of removal, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Louis Leeder, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 18, 2009, denying his motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on January 19, 2000. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Upon de novo review, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision for the reasons stated therein. In reaching this conclusion we note that the respondent’s assertion that he received inaccurate advice from an “agency” and an unidentified attorney which scared him to the point he decided not to go to his hearing on January 19, 2000, is not an exceptional circumstance to excuse his failure to appear. See section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1); 8 U.S.C. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Although the respondent has essentially alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the unidentified attorney, he has failed to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Moreover, he has claimed that he married a United States citizen and that she has filed an I-130 visa petition on his behalf. However, he failed to present evidence that the I-130 had been filed and approved or otherwise establish that he is eligible for adjustment of status. Consequently, we find no basis to disturb the Immigration Judge’s determination.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Richard Jurgens
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order in this case on August 29, 2008. This case was last before the Board on May 25, 2010, however, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and reconsider for having been filed out of time. In that decision, we found that the respondent had not properly set forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, or otherwise offered arguments or evidence of any exceptional situation to persuade us to reconsider our prior order sua sponte or to reopen the proceedings on our own motion under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). On June 23, 2010, the respondent filed the instant motion. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
Although the motion is titled “Motion for Reconsideration”, the respondent has not contested the bases of our decision denying his previous motion. See generally Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (holding that a motion to reconsider a decision of the Board must include, inter alia, an allegation of material factual or legal errors in the prior decision that is supported by pertinent authority). Instead, the respondent has submitted new evidence, including evidence that since our prior order he has attempted to comply with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the Board. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We find, therefore, that the instant motion is in the nature of a motion to reopen. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). As a motion to reopen, the motion is untimely and number-barred. See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). We do not find that any of the general exceptions to the filing restrictions apply to the respondent’s motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). Moreover, for the reasons below, we do not find that the exercise of our sua sponte authority is warranted in this case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
In our decision dismissing the appeal, we found no legal error in the Immigration Judge’s decision pretermitting the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(c), because the 1989 conviction underlying the charges of removability was by jury trial. See I.N.S. v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (U.S. 2001); Alexandre v. United States Attorney General, 452 F.3d 1204 (11th Cir. 2006). The respondent now appears to blame his former counsel for his inability to apply for the section 212(c) waiver. Specifically, he asserts that his former counsel failed to inform him of the immigration consequences of his criminal convictions when she conceded removability on his behalf. See Respondent’s Motion at 9.
 
*2 It was due to the respondent’s criminal convictions, rather than to any action on the part of his former counsel in these proceedings, that the respondent was placed in these removal proceedings. The respondent has not contested the fact that he was convicted by a jury trial rather than by a plea of guilty. Cf Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (U.S. 2010) (holding that counsel engaged in deficient performance by failing to advise the defendant that his plea of guilty made him subject to automatic deportation). Nor is there any evidence offered in support of this motion to indicate that an attack on the respondent’s convictions has resulted in a vacatur. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (BIA 1996). We find, therefore, that the respondent has failed to establish that his former counsel committed any error resulting in prejudice to the respondent when she conceded removability on his behalf. See Dakane v. United States Attorney General, 371 F.3d 771 (11th Cir. 2004). In sum, we reject the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and we conclude that reopening sua sponte is not warranted in this case. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely, number-barred motion to reopen will be denied.¿FN1º

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On April 22, 2010, the respondent, a native and citizen of Guyana, filed a timely motion to reopen these removal proceedings to afford him the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status and a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c).
 
In our prior order we agreed with the Immigration Judge that it was futile for the respondent to apply for a 212(c) waiver because it could not waive the respondent’s 2005 conviction for the unlawful possession of more than 30 grams of marijuana.
 
The respondent now argues that his accredited representative erred in admitting that he was convicted of the offense of unlawful possession of marijuana in 2005 and conceding that he was removable under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation (Exhs. 4, 9 and 13; Tr. at 72-73). He claims that his accredited representative should not have introduced the lab report which reflected that the respondent was in possession of 3.8 ounces of marijuana. See Respondent’s Motion at 3. The respondent asserts that he was prejudiced when the lab report, which does not constitute a record of conviction, was submitted to the Immigration Court. In short, the respondent asserts that the Department of Homeland Security was only able to establish that he was convicted of possessing more than 30 grams of marijuana and that he is removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act - because of the actions of his representative. The respondent has complied with the requirements for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009).
 
Essentially, the respondent seeks to withdraw the admission and concession entered by his accredited representative. See Respondent’s Motion, Attachment C. We have long held that absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made before, during, or even after a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity binds his client as a judicial admission; and that there is a strong presumption that such a decision is a reasonable tactical decision. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). Notably, the respondent does not claim that the pleading is factually untrue or incorrect. Given the facts and circumstances of this case, we find that the respondent is bound by the admissions and concessions he made by and through his representative.
 
*2 Additionally, the respondent’s marijuana conviction would have rendered him inadmissible pursuant to section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), and, thus, ineligible for adjustment of status. See section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). Even if the lab report had not been submitted, he would be ineligible for a corresponding waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), because he is a lawful permanent resident who has been convicted of an aggravated felony.
 
Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992) (motion to reopen may be denied based upon the failure to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought).
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sergio A. Saldivar, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alice Hogue Kay
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on April 2, 2002, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). We also denied the respondent’s motion to remand the record. On July 21, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
With certain exceptions, a motion to reopen must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s motion was filed more than 8 years after the final administrative order of removal and is therefore untimely. Furthermore, the respondent has not established an exceptional situation warranting our consideration of his motion sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
The respondent contends that reopening is warranted in light of the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, 130 S. Ct. 2577 (2010) and in Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010). The respondent asserts that he would contest his charge of removability based on multiple drug possession convictions under the holding in Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, supra, and that he “would show through testimony and evidence presented that he was not properly admonished of the possibility of immigration consequences following his pleas to these possession charges as now required in the case of Padilla v. Kentucky,” supra (Mot. at 5).
 
The DHS correctly contends that the respondent has not shown how Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, supra, would change the outcome of his case. In Carachuri, the Supreme Court held that when an alien has been convicted of a simple possession offense that has not been enhanced based on the fact of a prior conviction, he has not been convicted of a felony punishable as such under the Controlled Substances Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2), and therefore has not been convicted of an “aggravated felony” for purposes of section 240A(a)(3) of the Act. The respondent was not found subject to removal based on an aggravated felony conviction. He was found subject to removal under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (conviction for offense relating to a controlled substance other than a single offense involving possession for one’s own use of thirty grams or less of marijuana).
 
*2 Also, the respondent has not shown that his case should be reopened under Padilla v. Kentucky, supra. In Padilla, the Supreme Court held that competent legal advice includes notice to aliens in criminal proceedings of the potential effects of those proceedings on their immigration status or benefits. The respondent has not presented evidence with his motion to support the claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in his criminal cases. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (motion to reopen must be supported by affidavits and other evidentiary material). In any event and more fundamentally, the respondent does not assert that either of his convictions has been vacated, and based on the record before us, his convictions are valid for immigration purposes.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely and does not present an exceptional situation that warrants reopening sua sponte. Accordingly the motion will be denied. The motion for a stay of removal pending adjudication of this motion is moot.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

ORDER:
 
Considering the intervening events in this case since it was last before the Immigration Judge, the respondent’s motion to reopen her removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge will be granted and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge to provide her the opportunity to pursue an application for adjustment of status. In this regard, we note that the respondent has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for advancing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; the immediate relative visa petition filed on her behalf by her United States citizen husband has been approved; and, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) now states that it does not oppose the respondent’s motion to remand her proceedings to the Immigration Court noting that she appears statutorily eligible to adjust her status. Accordingly, the appeal from the denial of her motion to reopen is sustained and these proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings not in consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

July 29, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patricia Vargas, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 In a June 22, 2009, decision, the Immigration Judge deemed the respondent to have abandoned his application for cancellation of removal under 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1). The respondent has appealed from this decision. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the appeal. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard, and review all other issues, including whether the parties have met their relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii); see also Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The record reflects that on May 10, 2006, the respondent, through undersigned counsel, Patricia Vargas, informed the Immigration Court that he was applying for cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge instructed counsel to mail the biometrics form and to appear at the next hearing with copies of the respondent’s application and a biometrics stamp.
 
On September 6, 2006, the respondent appeared with Miguel Olano, an associate attorney who was appearing on behalf of attorney Vargas. Attorney Olano mistakenly believed that an application for cancellation of removal had already been filed, and upon discovering otherwise, requested “some time for attorney prep.” The Immigration Judge notified attorney Olano that the respondent should file his application at the next hearing. The Immigration Judge also notified attorney Olano that a background check report from the California Department of Justice (“CAL DOJ”) and the biometrics stamp should be submitted, and that if the respondent does not have both documents, the application will be deemed abandoned.
 
On January 10, 2007, the respondent appeared with attorney Olano, and filed his application for cancellation of removal. Attorney Olano informed the Immigration Court that the biometrics was done on December 18, 2006, but upon further questioning by the Immigration Judge, it was revealed that the CAL DOJ was not sought or filed. The Immigration Judge returned the application, and informed the respondent, through counsel, to resubmit the application with the CAL DOJ and proof of the completion of the biometrics processing at the next hearing.
 
On May 9, 2007, the respondent appeared with attorney Vargas who informed the Immigration Judge that the biometrics was done, but that attorney Olano’s notes do not indicate that a CAL DOJ was requested. The Immigration Judge issued an order that day deeming the respondent’s application abandoned. However, on August 20, 2007, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s motion to reopen which was based on a claim that he received ineffective assistance from attorney Olano who did not know the difference between fingerprinting for biometrics and fingerprinting for the CAL DOJ report.
 
*2 At the reconvened hearing on October 17, 2007, the respondent appeared with attorney Vargas. The respondent indicated that he had his fingerprints done, and that he gave the receipt to his attorney. There was confusion as to whether the respondent was referring to the biometrics receipt or the CAL DOJ receipt. Attorney Vargas indicated that the respondent does not have a biometrics receipt, nor was a receipt found in the record. The Immigration Judge once again adjourned the hearing, emphasizing to counsel that his application will be deemed abandoned if it is discovered that the respondent has not completed his biometrics.
 
On July 7, 2008, the respondent appeared before the Immigration Court with attorney Olano, against whom an ineffective assistance of counsel claim was previously filed. At this hearing, the Immigration Judge learned that when the respondent went to have his fingerprints re-done with DHS, it did not allow him to do so because the system showed that the respondent’s fingerprints were taken within 15 months. The Immigration Judge informed the respondent and counsel that he does not need the biometrics or the CAL DOJ, but reminded the respondent to get his fingerprints for the next hearing.
 
Finally, on June 22, 2009, the respondent appeared with attorney Vargas who confirmed with the Immigration Judge that the respondent was last fingerprinted on November 15, 2007. Attorney Vargas endeavored to explain that the respondent tried to have his fingerprints done on March 2008, but that it was rejected. When the respondent was asked why he did not get his prints taken, the respondent expressed confusion and lack of understanding as to who would send him an appointment to have his fingerprints done. The Immigration Judge found the respondent’s explanation “weak” and “difficult to understand,” particularly because he “had been through the system as much as he has,” and deemed the respondent’s application abandoned.
 
We set forth the procedural history of this case to clarify what transpired at each of the hearing as reflected in the transcript. It is clear from the transcript that the Immigration Judge gave the respondent numerous adjournments and opportunities to file the application for cancellation of removal, submit evidence to satisfy his burden of establishing that he is not statutorily barred from relief, and comply with the biometric processing requirements for law enforcement checks as provided under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.47. The Immigration Judge’s frustration, in light of the protracted procedural history of this case, is understandable. It is also clear, however, that the respondent had made some attempt to provide what was asked of him but that a confluence of circumstances — including ineffective assistance of counsel, unprepared counsel, the passage of time, confusing instructions, and the respondent’s inaction — caused the delay in the adjudication, and ultimate denial as abandoned, of the application for cancellation of removal. In light of the totality of the record before us, and considering the lack of response from the DHS on appeal, we will remand the record to the Immigration Court so that the respondent may be given one, final, reasonable opportunity to update his fingerprints and proceed with his application for cancellation of removal. On remand, the Immigration Judge should clarify and give the respondent adequate notice of the fingerprinting requirement and the consequences of noncompliance as required by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Karapetyan v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 1118 (9th Cir. 2008), and Cui v. Mukasey, 538 F.3d 1289 (9th Cir. 2008), and the regulations in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.47. In view of the foregoing, the following order shall be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and entry of a new decision.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher J. Stender, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Victoria Levin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on August 5, 1992, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s March 16, 1992, decision finding the respondent statutorily ineligible for voluntary departure and ordering him deported as charged to Mexico.
 
On April 29, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reopen these proceedings premised, in part, on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion is untimely filed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions not relevant here, a motion to reopen “must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which a final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is earlier”).
 
However, because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether this case warrants equitable tolling of the time limits on motions to reopen. The Ninth Circuit has held that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
The respondent has failed to provide an explanation of his efforts to pursue his case since he was issued a final deportation order in 1992. Therefore, we find equitable tolling of the 90-day deadline is unwarranted. In addition, the respondent has not complied with the requirements for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009).
 
Furthermore, the respondent has failed to show prejudice resulting from his attorney’s actions. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra; Ahmed v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 768, 772 (9th Cir. 2008) (“prejudice results when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. The petitioner does not need to show that she would win on her claims absent her attorneys’ deficient performance. She need only show plausible grounds for relief” (citations omitted)). The respondent is correct that section 249 of the Act does not require that the registry applicant be a person of good moral character for a specified period of time. See generally Matter of Sanchez-Linn, 20 I&N Dec. 362 (BIA 1991). However, we need not determine whether the respondent could have established good moral character for registry purposes, because he was otherwise ineligible for registry at the time of his 1992 deportation hearing. To be eligible for registry, the applicant must be admissible pursuant to section 212(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a). See section 249 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1259. The respondent was inadmissible under section 212(a)(2) of the Act due to his 1989 drug-related conviction.¿FN1º Accordingly, he has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by his attorney’s conduct. Based on the foregoing, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
*2 The respondent’s request for a stay is denied. The Board entertains stays only when an appeal, a motion to reopen, or a motion to reconsider is pending before the Board. In the instant case, the respondent does not have an appeal or a motion pending before us. See 8 C.F.R. §1003.6.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s motion is denied. This case was last before the Board on November 17, 2009, when the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable as charged and denying the respondent’s request for a continuance. On January 19, 2010, the respondent filed a motion requesting reconsideration and stay of removal. The respondent’s motion is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Furthermore, the respondent, who has presented no evidence demonstrating either that his first visa petition was improperly denied¿FN1º or that his second visa petition, which was filed on his behalf by the same spouse/petitioner who filed the first denied petition, has not identified any error of fact or law in the Board’s previous decision that would alter the outcome. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). See also Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 792 (BIA 2009) (recognizing no abuse of discretion in the denial of a continuance for adjudication of a second visa petition when the first I-130 filed by the same petitioner was denied) (citations omitted). Moreover, we do not find the respondent’s mere disagreement with or disapproval of the outcome of the Board’s previous detailed decision sufficient to demonstrate either that the Board improperly evaluated or disregarded the facts and evidence presented or legal error.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
George A. Terezakis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeffrey E. Blivaiss
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s February 17, 2010, decision ordering him removed from the United States. After filing his appeal, moreover, the respondent submitted a motion in which he requests that the record be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal and urges us to affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion to remand will be denied.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic and a lawful permanent resident of the United States. On May 21, 2001, the respondent was convicted of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in violation of sections 110 and 239.39(1) of the New York Penal Law. (Exh. 4). Based on that conviction, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable from the United States as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and a violation of State law relating to a controlled substance. Sections 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (2006). The respondent did not file any applications for relief from removal, but instead requested a continuance of the proceedings so that he could pursue a collateral attack on his conviction in the New York courts. The Immigration Judge determined that the pendency of such a collateral attack was not good cause for a continuance, and therefore he ordered the respondent removed. This appeal followed.
 
In his Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) the respondent challenges his removability, asserting that the DHS “failed to submit the complete, certified, conviction records which would have been necessary to establish respondent’s removability” and also failed to establish that his 2001 drug conviction was for the attempted sale of a federally-controlled substance, as required to support the removal charges. We find no merit in these arguments. The administrative record, Exhibit 4, contains a certificate of disposition, bearing the official seal of the Clerk of Kings County, New York, which reflects the respondent’s 2001 conviction for “ATTEMPTED CRIMINAL SALE OF A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE 3rd DEGREE PL 110-220.39 01 CF (COCAINE).” This certificate of disposition is valid proof of the respondent’s conviction under section 240(c)(3)(B)(vi) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B)(vi). Furthermore, cocaine is a federally-controlled substance, and the respondent has identified no other drug which is included in the New York controlled substance schedules but excluded from the corresponding Federal schedules. Accordingly, we find that the DHS has satisfied its burden of proving the charges of deportability by clear and convincing evidence.
 
*2 The respondent also argues in the Notice of Appeal that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion and violated the respondent’s statutory and constitutional rights by failing to grant a continuance of the respondent’s February 17, 2010, removal hearing. According to the respondent, he had retained new counsel on the eve of that hearing, and he argues that denial of a continuance deprived him of his right to be represented by “counsel of ¿hisº choice.” However, the respondent was represented throughout his February 17, 2010, hearing by his then-counsel of record, Malick Diop. Indeed, in response to the Immigration Judge’s questions the respondent repeatedly affirmed that Mr. Diop was his lawyer. (Tr. 30-32). Furthermore, Mr. Diop acknowledged at the hearing that he was representing the respondent and made no effort to withdraw. Under the circumstances, we find no error (and no prejudice) in the Immigration Judge’s decision not to continue the matter.
 
In his appellate brief and motion to remand, the respondent claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the defense attorney who represented him during his criminal proceedings in New York. Specifically, the respondent claims that his guilty plea was not voluntary because he was not properly advised by his lawyer that conviction could lead to adverse immigration consequences. As the respondent notes, the United States Supreme Court has held that a criminal lawyer representing a non-citizen in connection with a guilty plea has a constitutional duty to advise the defendant that conviction may pose a risk of deportation. Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010). In light of Padilla, the respondent claims that the Immigration Judge violated his right to due process of law by failing to continue his removal proceedings while he pursued a collateral attack on his conviction in the New York courts.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not state “good cause” for a continuance. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6 (2010). A collateral attack does not impair the validity of an alien’s conviction for immigration purposes unless and until the conviction is overturned. E.g., Montilla v. INS, 926 F.2d 162, 164 (2d Cir. 1991); Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). While there may be some truly exceptional cases in which an Immigration Judge might justifiably grant a continuance during the pendency of a criminal matter, we reject the respondent’s assertion that he has a due process right to such a continuance. An Immigration Judge presented with a facially valid removal charge is not required by principles of fundamental fairness to adjourn removal proceedings every time an alien raises the speculative possibility that a collateral criminal proceeding might eventually affect the immigration case. Requiring a continuance in such contexts would invite abuse, and would often unnecessarily prolong the mandatory detention, at Government expense, of aliens with criminal convictions. See section 236(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) (requiring the DHS to detain most criminal aliens, without bond, pending the conclusion of their removal proceedings). Furthermore, it has been nearly 5 months since the Immigration Judge rendered his decision, yet we have received no indication that the respondent’s conviction has been vacated or materially modified in any way by the New York courts. Under the circumstances, we have no basis for concluding that the respondent suffered substantial prejudice arising from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his continuance request.
 
*3 In conclusion, we find no error or due process violation in the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s continuance request and ordering him removed. Furthermore, the respondent has not persuaded us that any constructive purpose would be served by a remand. In the event the respondent ultimately prevails on his collateral challenge, he shall of course be free to file a motion to reopen the proceedings. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7). The following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kenneth Byrd, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on December 17, 2009, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal that was entered against her on November 16, 1999. The respondent now files another motion to reopen, claiming that she received ineffective assistance of counsel from the prior attorney who filed her first motion to reopen and urging that her proceedings should be reopened. The Department &Homeland Security has not responded to the current motion.
 
Even assuming the time limits do not apply to the present motion to reopen, because she still seeks reopening based on a claim of lack of proper notice, the motion is number-barred. Section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A) (providing that an alien may filed only one motion to reopen removal proceedings); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (only one motion to reopen may be filed regarding an order of removal entered in absentia); see also Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000).
 
Although the respondent does not make her argument clear, it appears she wishes the motions number limit to be equitably tolled because she received ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to the filing of her first motion to reopen. Habchy v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 858, 864-65 (8th Cir. 2006) (discussing other circuits’ recognition of the “sparingly invoked” doctrine of equitable tolling for ineffective assistance of counsel claims). Specifically, she contends that his failure to include an affidavit or other evidence caused her motion to be denied.
 
We first find that the respondent has failed to meet any of the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), such that she has properly raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. More importantly, she has not shown that equitable tolling is warranted in this case because she has not shown that she was prejudiced. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had signed the certified mail receipt showing she received the Notice to Appear (NTA), and she has never claimed that she did not sign that receipt. Rather, her argument on appeal was that the certified mail receipt might have pertained to some other document, not that she did not sign it. In our decision, we specifically found that the certified mail receipt related to the NTA. Thus, it does not appear that an affidavit would have any impact on the finding that the respondent was properly served with the NTA in this case and had notice of the removal proceedings against her. Nor has she identified any other evidence that counsel should have submitted that would have refuted this finding. She thus has not shown any failure on prior counsel’s part that prejudiced her, such that equitable tolling of the motions number limit would be warranted. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brian I. Kaplan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated June 4, 2008, denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded.
 
We review findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, under a clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent seeks reopening on the grounds that his prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance. To warrant reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must comply with the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and demonstrate that he was prejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance.
 
The respondent raised his ineffective assistance of counsel claim with the Immigration Judge but the Immigration Judge did not address it. Inasmuch as we do not make findings of fact in the course of deciding appeals, we will remand the record for such findings of fact and legal conclusions. See generally Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). Accordingly, we will grant the respondent’s appeal and the record will be remanded.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for the entry of a new decision.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Daniel Perez-Garcia, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Wm. Tracy Hamby
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 1, 2009, which ordered him removed from the United States. The parties have provided arguments on appeal. On appeal, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion denied.
 
We review Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but we review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). In this case, the record shows that the Immigration Judge set a deadline of March 31, 2009, for the filing of any and all applications for relief and advised the respondent of the consequences for the failure to file applications by the deadline (Tr. at 14, 16). However, no application was filed. Based on the undisputed facts, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deem the applications for relief abandoned. Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c).
 
The respondent seeks to reopen proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel and to remand the record so that he may pursue applications for cancellation of removal and withholding of removal. However, the motion does not establish compliance with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Specifically, although the motion indicates that the respondent filed a grievance against prior counsel, the motion is not accompanied by evidence to that effect. In addition, inasmuch as the motion does not include an application for either form of relief or any supporting documentation, the respondent cannot establish that prior counsel’s failure to timely file a claim for such relief resulted in substantial prejudice. Bolvito v. Mukasey, 527 F.3d 428, 438 (5th Cir. 2008). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hena Mansori, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joseph M. Yeung
Senior Attorney
*1 The respondent, who is from Jordan, filed a timely motion to reopen on January 27, 2010, after the Board dismissed his appeal on October 29, 2009. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) opposes the pending motion, which will be granted.
 
An Immigration Judge on November 4, 2008, issued a removal order concerning the respondent. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act, as failing to show the requisite hardship to a qualifying relative. The Immigration Judge also declined to further continue proceedings. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent failed to show that he was prima facie eligible for adjustment of status, not having submitted an application for relief or supporting documents (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 36). Rather, the adjustment application had been filed by the respondent with the DHS (Tr. at 32).
 
The respondent seeks to have proceedings reopened in order to pursue an application for adjustment of status. See section 245 of the Act. The respondent’s wife was adjusted to lawful permanent resident status on February 27, 2008 (Respondent’s Mot., at Exh. G). This resulted after a visa petition filed by the respondent’s wife’s brother, which was approved on April 4, 1997, became current (Respondent’s Mot., at Exh. F). The respondent argues that he is eligible for adjustment of status as a derivative beneficiary to the visa approved on behalf of his wife.
 
The respondent claims that his prior counsel, Raul Villasuso, Jr., was ineffective, because counsel failed to pursue an application for adjustment of status with the Immigration Judge, or inform him that the application had to be filed with the Immigration Court, rather than with the DHS (Respondent’s Mot., at 8-11).
 
Contrary to the argument of the DHS, the Board finds that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Former counsel disputes the respondent’s charges, although he does not explain why he argued, on appeal to the Board, that the Immigration Judge should have allowed the respondent to pursue his adjustment application before the DHS. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(1)(i)(“In the case of any alien who has been placed … in removal proceedings ¿other than as an arriving alienº, the Immigration Judge hearing the proceeding has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any application for adjustment of status the alien may file”).
 
*2 The respondent also contends that former counsel did not inform him of the Board’s October 29, 2009, decision until January 7, 2010, and therefore his failure to depart under the Board’s voluntary departure order should be excused (Respondent’s Mot., at 6, 7-8; Respondent’s Affidavit, at ¶ 36). See Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87 (BIA 2007)(alien has not voluntarily failed to depart the United States under section 240B(d)(1) of the Act when the alien, through no fault of his own, was unaware of the voluntary departure order). Under the circumstances, the respondent’s failure to depart under the Board’s voluntary departure order will be excused.
 
In consideration of the respondent’s motion and arguments, the case will be remanded to the Immigration Court for the respondent to pursue an application for adjustment of status.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded in order to afford the respondent an opportunity to present his application for adjustment of status to the Immigration Judge.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Merlyn N. Hernandez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on January 22, 2010, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
On February 22, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider our prior order. In our prior decision we observed that although the respondent indicated that he would supplement his motion to reopen, he had failed to do so. The respondent now asserts that he did submit additional documentation to this Board on or about September 16, 2009. Such documentation shows that he complied with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for presenting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The documentation also establishes his prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1255(i).
 
Giving the respondent the benefit of the doubt that the additional documentation was submitted prior to the issuance of our decision, we will consider the respondent’s prior motion together with the newly submitted documentation. The respondent’s July 24, 2009, motion to reopen was filed five years after we issued a final administrative order in this case on July 26, 2004. Because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether the 90-day motions deadline should be equitably tolled. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that the motions deadline may be equitably tolled where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error).
 
The respondent has demonstrated that he exercised due diligence in pursuing his case. The respondent states that his former counsel represented him for 13 years from March 1996 until around February 2009. The respondent retained former counsel to file a motion to reopen in 2006 so that he could apply for adjustment of status as an immediate relative. In early 2009, he sought a second legal opinion and eventually learned that the 2006 motion had never been filed. On July 21, 2009, as a result of current counsel’s inquiries, counsel acknowledged that he failed to file a motion to reopen in July 2006, as he had agreed to do. He refunded the $3,610 legal fees to the respondent. The respondent filed a motion to reopen shortly thereafter.
 
To successfully raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent must show that (1) counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence; and, (2) he was prejudiced by counsel’s performance, that is, that counsel’s performance was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004).
 
*2 While the respondent has demonstrated that former counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence, he has failed to demonstrate that his case was prejudiced by counsel’s conduct. In July 2006, the respondent sought reopening for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(i) of the Act, based on his wife’s April 2006 naturalization. The evidence of record establishes that the respondent was prima facie eligible for 245(i) adjustment of status at that time. However, even if counsel had promptly filed the motion to reopen in 2006 as agreed, the motion would have been untimely filed. Absent exceptional circumstances, which have not been shown, the motion would have been denied as untimely filed. Accordingly, even though the respondent exercised due diligence, he failed to establish that counsel prejudiced his case. Accordingly, we find no error in our prior decision.
 
Additionally, we find no error in our resolution of the respondent’s due process argument. The respondent asserts that his case should not have been “repapered” and, in any event, it was done without giving him notice pursuant to section 309(c)(3) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA). It is undisputed that he was served with an Order to Show Cause (OSC) on or about December 28, 1994. We recognize that the record is unclear about whether the OSC was actually filed with the Immigration Court and, if so, whether those proceedings had been terminated (Tr. at 21-29). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.14(a) (proceedings commence when the charging document is filed with the Immigration Court by the Service).
 
Regardless, repapering is inapplicable in this case. Even if the respondent had been subject to deportation proceedings, he would not have been subject to the “stop-time rule” in conjunction with an application for suspension of deportation under former section 244(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1234(a). See section 309(c)(5)(A) of the IIRIRA, as amended by section 203(a)(1) of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 (NACARA). See also Matter of Nolasco, 22 I&N Dec. 632 (BIA 1999). The respondent acknowledged that more than 7 years had transpired between the date of his initial entry into the United States and the date of service of the OSC. See Respondent’s July 24, 2009 Motion at 19. See also Memorandum of Bo Cooper, General Counsel for the INS, dated Dec. 7, 1999, reproduced in 77 Interpreter Releases 39, App. 1 (Jan. 10, 2000). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brian C. DiFranco, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The motion is denied. This case was last before the Board on December 18, 2009, when the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). On May 17, 2010, the respondent filed a motion requesting reconsideration and sua sponte reopening. The respondent’s motion is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b), (c). Furthermore, the respondent, who was found to have acquired his lawful permanent resident status through fraud or misrepresentation, has not identified any error of fact or law in the Board’s previous decision that would alter the outcome. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). Cf. Matter of Koloamatangi, 23 I&N Dec. 548 (BIA 2003) (finding that an alien who acquired permanent resident status through fraud or misrepresentation has never been “lawfully admitted for permanent residence” and is therefore ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act). Significantly, we do not find the respondent’s mere disagreement with or disapproval of the outcome of our previous detailed decision sufficient to demonstrate either that we improperly evaluated or disregarded the facts and evidence presented or legal error.
 
Moreover, the respondent has not identified any changed circumstances in Mexico that would have excepted his untimely motion from the applicable time limitations. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). The respondent’s motion also fails to comply with both the statutory and regulatory requirements for reopening. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 100.3.2(c). The respondent’s motion does not contain any new or previously unavailable or unobtainable evidence demonstrating the respondent’s eligibility for any other forms of relief.¿FN1º
 
Finally, we find no other reason for this Board’s further consideration of the respondent’s claim on our own motion pursuant to this Board’s sua sponte authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
*2 On this record, we find no reason to overlook the untimeliness of the respondent’s motion. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Nora E. Norman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Continuance, termination
 
The respondent has filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s April 5, 2010, decision. In that decision the Immigration Judge found the respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, removable, as charged, based on his admissions, and concession of removability (Tr. at 9), including his 2009 Florida controlled substance conviction,¿FN1º a “drug-trafficking” aggravated felony offense as defined under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 (a)(43)(B). See also Group Exh. 1. In addition, the Immigration Judge had previously denied the respondent’s request to continue the proceedings while awaiting the result of his post-conviction motion to vacate this conviction. Finally, noting that the respondent had expressed no fear of persecution or torture if returned to Jamaica, and having found the respondent convicted of an aggravated felony offense, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent had failed to establish his statutory eligibility for any relief from removal, and ordered his removal to Jamaica. The appeal will be dismissed. The respondent’s request to proceed on appeal n forma pauperis is granted under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). See Matter of Chicas, 19 I&N Dec. 114 (BIA 1984).
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2010); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in an appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2010); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008) rev’d on other grounds, Kaplun v. Attorney General of the United States, 602 F.3d 260 (3d Cir. 2010); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
*2 At the outset, to the extent the respondent has challenged the Immigration Judge’s findings as to his removability and eligibility for relief from removal, we consider that the distinct and formal concession of removability, made by the respondent’s attorney acting in his professional capacity and in the respondent’s presence during the removal hearing, is binding on the respondent as a judicial admission (Tr. at 9). Applicable regulations, which have the force and effect of law as to the Immigration Judges and this Board, provide in pertinent part that “the immigration judge may determine that removability as charged has been established by the admissions of the respondent.” 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c) (2010). The respondent in the instant case has not established that circumstances exist that would permit the withdrawal of his prior judicial admissions. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made as a tactical decision by an attorney in a deportation proceeding is binding on his alien client); cf 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(B) (authorizing summary dismissal of appeals when “¿tºhe only reason for the appeal specified by the party concerned involves a finding of fact or a conclusion of law that was conceded by that party at a prior proceeding”); see generally Pool Co. v. Cooper, 274 F.3d 173, 185 (5th Cir. 2001) (finding that the court was entitled to treat a concession as a binding judicial admission of fact.); Martinez v. Bally’s Louisiana, Inc., 244 F.3d 474 (5th Cir 2001) (a judicial admission is conclusive, unless the court allows it to be withdrawn).
 
The respondent has also raised a claim of denial of due process premised on his allegations of ineffective assistance by his former attorney’s presentation of his case. Where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is made, the Board has found that certain criteria must be met. Specifically, the claim must be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make, counsel must be informed of the allegations against him and provided an opportunity to respond, and the respondent must indicate whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2006) (citing Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-498 (5 th Cir. 2000) (upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada)). We note the respondent here has failed to meet any of the criteria set forth in Lozada, in order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*3 Moreover, even if we were to consider arguendo the respondent’s contentions on appeal challenging his removability, we find his arguments to be unavailing. The record includes undisputed evidence showing that the respondent was convicted of Possession of Ecstacy with Intent to Sell or Deliver, in violation of FLA. STAT. ANN. § 893.13(1)(a)(1). Although the Palm Beach County Circuit Court withheld adjudication of guilt and placed the respondent on 18 months’ probation, this offense qualifies as a conviction for federal immigration purposes. See INA § 101(a)(48)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A) (defining a “conviction” under the Act, in the case of an alien whose adjudication of guilt has been withheld, as a case where the alien has entered a plea of guilty to an offense and the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien’s liberty to be imposed); see also Madriz-Alvarado v. INS, 383 F.3d 321, 331 (5th Cir. 2004).
 
Furthermore, the respondent’s application for post-conviction relief in the Florida courts does not alter the fact that the 2009 Florida “drug trafficking” aggravated felony conviction may nevertheless be used as the factual predicate for an order of removal or a determination of statutory ineligibility for relief from removal. Specifically, the respondent contends that his conviction may be invalid because he entered a defective guilty plea due to ineffective assistance from criminal counsel. However, the fact that the respondent may be pursuing post-conviction relief in the form of a collateral attack on a conviction in criminal court does not affect its finality for federal immigration purposes, or warrant the grant of a motion to continue. See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992). As a general rule, an Immigration Judge need not hold removal proceedings in abeyance based upon the mere possibility that a collateral criminal proceeding could have a future impact on the alien’s immigration status. The respondent had (and has) a valid “conviction” for immigration purposes, and his collateral attack upon that conviction does not operate to negate its validity until it is in fact overturned or materially amended. Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996).
 
The respondent has presented no evidence with this appeal that any collateral attack on his 2009 Florida conviction underlying these removal proceedings has been vacated, and therefore the respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge’s denial of his continuance request has compromised the fairness of his removal proceedings. The respondent references the recent decision of Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010), in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that a lawyer representing an alien in connection with a guilty plea to a criminal offense has a constitutional duty to advise the alien about the risk of deportation arising from the conviction. However, the respondent’s speculation that his conviction might be invalid, including in light of Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, does not change the finality for immigration purposes of such conviction, unless and until it were to be overturned by a criminal court. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996).
 
*4 Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frank T. Morell, Esquire
 
REISSUED DECISION
 
*1 The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal on February 26, 2009, and denied a previous motion seeking reissuance on July 22, 2009. On November 27, 2009, the respondent, who is from Mexico, filed an untimely and number-barred motion to reopen. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The Board will reopen proceedings under its authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and reissue the February 26, 2009, decision.
 
First, however, to the extent that the respondent seeks reopening as to the merits of the Board’s February 26, 2009, decision, based on ineffective assistance of counsel of prior counsel Ray Antonio Estolano, or pursuant to 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(a), the motion will be denied. In affirming the Immigration Judge, the Board found the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, as being unable to establish the 7 years of continuous residence necessary to qualify for such relief, after being admitted as a lawful permanent resident of the United States on October 10, 1994. Section 240A(d)(1) of the Act.
 
A respondent claiming that he received ineffective assistance of counsel must show that counsel failed to perform with “sufficient competence,” Alcala v. Holder, 563 F.3d 1009, 1019 (9th Cir. 2009), such that proceedings are “so fundamentally unfair that the alien is prevented from reasonably presenting ¿ hisº case.” Torres-Chavez v. Holder, 567 F.3d 1096, 1100 (9th Cir. 2009). The respondent “must also show substantial prejudice by demonstrating that the alleged violation affected the outcome of the proceedings.” Id. (citation omitted); Zetino v. Holder, 596 F.3d 517, 525 (9th Cir. 2010)(a showing of prejudice concerning an alleged due process violation “… means that the outcome of the proceeding may have been affected by the alleged violation”).
 
The motion argues that former counsel did not present facts showing that the respondent resided with his lawful permanent resident parents for 7 years prior to his first adult use of marijuana, in July, 1999. Respondent’s Mot., at 7; Mercado-Zazueta v. Holder, 580 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir. 2009)(alien’s father’s lawful permanent resident status was imputed to the alien when he was an unemancipated minor child living with his father, in order to satisfy the residence requirement of section 240A(a)(1) of the Act).
 
*2 The respondent fails to show that he was prejudiced by counsel’s actions. The respondent testified that he came to live in the United States in 1994 (Tr. at 11-12). His current declaration admits that he has no personal recollection of when he came to live in the United States, and his only evidence in this regard is an immunization record indicating that he may have received an immunization in California in 1992 (Respondent’s Declaration, at ¶ 7; Respondent’s Mot., Exh. A).
 
The motion also argues that his use of marijuana in 1999 was an act of juvenile delinquency which did not render him inadmissible under section 212(a)(2) of the Act and prevent him from establishing 7 years of continuous residence after his admission (Respondent’s Mot., at 8-9). However, as the Immigration Judge found, the respondent turned 18 on July 31, 1999, and smoked marijuana on that date, as well as in 2000 (I.J. at 5; Tr. at 17-20); see also Board’s Feb. 26, 2009, dec. To the extent that the respondent otherwise argues that he should have been found eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, Respondent’s Mot., at 9-12, the Immigration Judge and Board fully considered his testimony and found otherwise. The Board finds no reason to reconsider these decisions. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006)(a motion to reconsider must allege a material factual or legal error, assert that the Board erred in affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision without opinion, or argue a change in law).
 
As to the pending motion’s request for reissuance of the Board’s February 26, 2009, decision, the motion argues that the decision should be reissued, based on Estolano’s actions. That is, in the prior motion seeking reissuance, Estolano admitted that he failed to provide the Board with a change of address form, as required by regulation. The respondent has met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Board’s decision will be reissued and treated as if entered on today’s date. Singh v. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 1170 (9th Cir. 2007) (reissuance of prior Board decision may be warranted).
 
ORDER: The respondent’s pending motion to reissue is granted. In all other respects, the motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated February 26, 2009, attached hereto, is hereby reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s July 22, 2009, denying reissuance is vacated.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ramon J. Ferrer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
June Y.I. Ito
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of Tonga, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on September 21, 2009, after failing to appear at a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on September 23, 2009. The Immigration Judge denied it on October 23, 2009, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be sustained.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). We decide this appeal de novo.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that “exceptional circumstances” prevented his appearance at the hearing. We consider the totality of the evidence in evaluating this issue. See Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33 (BIA 1998) and Matter of B-A-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 1998). See also Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, 298 F.3d 888 (9th Cir. 2002); Singh v. INS, 213 F.3d 1050 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
Here, we consider that the record contains a statement from the respondent’s former attorney. Therein, counsel admits that he erroneously instructed the respondent to appear for his hearing on September 23, 2009, rather than the correct date, September 21, 2009. The respondent’s declaration corroborates his attorney’s account. In addition, we consider that the respondent filed his motion to reopen almost immediately after learning that he was ordered removed from the United States in absentia. His due diligence in this matter is strong evidence of the respondent’s lack of intention to miss his hearing. We further consider that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit does not require that all the procedural requirements for proving ineffective assistance of counsel be satisfied when attorney negligence is clear from the record. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
We find based on the totality of the evidence that the respondent has established that reopening of these proceedings based on “exceptional circumstances” is appropriate. It appears that the respondent’s failure to appear at his hearing was caused by an errant instruction from his former counsel. A clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel is present. We will reopen these proceedings.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and these proceedings are reopened and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kamah Thoronka, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Deborah Todd
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 29, 2008, granting the respondent the privilege of voluntarily departing the United States pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). On appeal, the respondent claims, through present counsel, that he was ineffectively represented at his hearing before the Immigration Judge. The respondent has not presented any evidence in support of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and does not identify any evidence before the Immigration Judge that supports his assertion that his prior attorney never advised him of other potential relief. Indeed, the record indicates that prior counsel explored all possibilities with the respondent (Tr. at 3). The statements of respondent’s present counsel on appeal are not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980). The respondent’s uncorroborated assertion on appeal, through counsel, is insufficient to establish that his prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance in this matter. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Inasmuch as the respondent has failed to establish that his former counsel rendered ineffective assistance in this matter, the respondent has failed to establish that the waiver of appeal required in order to receive voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act was unknowing and involuntary. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(1)(i)(D). Therefore, the respondent, through former counsel, waived appeal and the appeal he has filed with this Board is improper. This Board has no jurisdiction over the respondent’s appeal because he necessarily waived appeal in order to receive the extended period of voluntary departure he pursued through former counsel. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The Immigration Judge’s decision in this matter was final on October 29, 2008, to the same extent as if no appeal was taken. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pascual Madrigal, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carmen A. Leal
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s March 11, 2010, decision denying his application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1255. The respondent also requests a waiver of the appellate filing fee. The fee waiver request is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility determinations, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was admitted temporarily to the United States as a non-immigrant worker on March 27, 2008, but remained longer than authorized (I.J. at 2; Exh. 2). He is married to a United States citizen and is the beneficiary of an approved Alien Relative Petition (Form I-130) (I.J. at 2; Exh. 5). Based upon the foregoing, through his former counsel, he articulated relief from removal in the form of adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, and he was scheduled for a hearing on the merits of this application to be held on February 1, 2010 (I.J. at 2; Exh. 7).
 
At the February 1, 2010, hearing, the Immigration Judge observed that no adjustment application had been filed with the Immigration Court (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 11 - 13). The Immigration Judge continued the matter until March 11, 2010, and set a deadline of March 4, 2010, for filing the adjustment application and any supporting documents (I.J. at 2-3; Tr. at 35). The respondent, through former counsel, submitted his application for relief without supporting documentation or a motion to accept late filing on March 8, 2010 (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 39-40, 42-43; Exh. 7). At the March 11, 2010, hearing the respondent’s attorney first sought a further continuance and then attempted to withdraw the respondent’s application for adjustment of status without first consulting with his client (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 54-62). Then, after being given an opportunity to speak to the respondent privately, his attorney indicated that the sole form of relief sought was adjustment of status, and he submitted the case for a decision without further supplementing the record (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 62-64). Based on the foregoing, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s adjustment application (I.J. at 7-8). The Immigration Judge also held that the attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel throughout the course of proceedings as he failed to (1) provide competent representation, (2) act with reasonable promptness and diligence, and (3) adequately communicate with the respondent in violation of 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.102(o), (q), and (r) (I.J. at 3-5).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent, through new counsel, cites his prior attorney’s deficient performance and seeks a remand to further pursue his application for adjustment of status (Resp. Brief at 4). Generally, a motion to remand is subject to the same substantive requirements as a motion to reopen. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). As such, usually a respondent must make a prima facie showing of both statutory and discretionary eligibility for the relief requested. See e.g., INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, supra. Additionally, because the respondent’s remand request is based on ineffective assistance, the general requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), are relevant. According to our holding in Matter of Lozada, a motion based on ineffective assistance generally should be supported by: (1) an affidavit from the aggrieved respondent testifying to the relevant facts, including information about scope of the representation agreement and any alleged breaches by the attorney, (2) evidence that the former attorney has been advised of allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond along with any response offered, and (3) evidence that appropriate disciplinary authorities have been notified or, if not, the reason such notification was not pursued. See id. at 639.
 
This case is unique because the Immigration Judge developed the record and made specific findings of fact with respect to the ineffective assistance provided by the respondent’s former counsel and these findings are relevant to the factors outlined in Matter of Lozada. Specifically, he concluded that the respondent’s former counsel breached his duty to communicate with and keep the respondent apprised of developments in his case, explain the nature of the proceedings against the respondent and the relief available to him, and timely prepare and file the application for relief (I.J. at 3, 5; Tr. at 11-15, 36, 39-55, 59, 63). For example, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent’s counsel did not inform the respondent about the untimely filing of the adjustment application and the respondent first learned about this particular breach on the record at the March 11, 2010 hearing, evidencing one instance of the attorney’s failure to appropriately communicate with the respondent (I.J. at 5; Tr. 44, 50). Additionally, the Immigration Judge also specifically highlighted the attorney’s attempt to withdraw the adjustment application without first consulting with the respondent as another serious breach demonstrating ineffective assistance (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 54-62). In light of these specific findings illustrating the particularly egregious nature of the attorney’s conduct, particularly when coupled with the respondent’s apparent statutory eligibility for adjustment of status, we find that remand is warranted in the interests of justice.¿FN1º See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 311 (BIA 1998) (requiring ineffective assistance be so egregious that it renders the hearing unfair); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640; see also Ogbemudia v. INS, 988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir. 1993) (requiring the respondent to demonstrate “substantial prejudice” in order to establish that a hearing was fundamentally unfair). On remand, the parties may supplement the record as necessary to assist the Immigration Judge in adjudicating the application for relief.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

On appeal, the Department of Homeland Security maintains that the removal order should be upheld as the respondent failed to submit an affidavit of support below, and thus, he cannot establish that he is admissible and that he is not a public charge (DHS Brief at 2). While this is an accurate characterization of the record, we cannot conclude that the failure to submit a legally sufficient affidavit of support can be separated from the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim, as the claim is based in part on the attorney’s failure to communicate with him. As such, this failure to communicate appears to have infected the entirety of the proceedings.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jaak Olesk, Esquire

Thelma M. Gonzalez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Termination; remand
 
In a decision dated March 3, 2010, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable based on his concessions and, since no application for relief had been filed, ordered him removed to Mexico. The respondent’s appeal of that decision will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) failed to submit evidence to establish that the respondent was present without being admitted or paroled. Although he asserts that he has withdrawn all prior concessions to the charges of removability (see Tr. at 2), the Immigration Judge did not permit the respondent to do so because the only reason given for the request was that the respondent had a new attorney; no allegations of ineffective assistance were made and the respondent did not present evidence to meet the procedural requirements for such a claim or to show that he was prejudiced.¿FN1º The Immigration Judge also noted that the respondent and his current counsel had sufficient time, after numerous continuances, in which to gather and submit evidence to support the respondent’s claim that he had been lawfully admitted or paroled into the United States and, therefore, was not removable (I.J. at 4-5).
 
On appeal, the respondent again does not assert ineffective assistance of counsel and also provides no evidence to support his continuing claim of lawful entry into the United States. We can find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable as charged. Since no applications for relief have been submitted and the respondent does not allege eligibility for any form of relief, we decline to remand proceedings.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Denise C. Hochul
Senior Attorney
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact (withdrawn)
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)º - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º - Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
  
APPLICATION: Termination; adjustment of status
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s July 10, 2008, decision pretermitting his application for adjustment of status and finding him removable as charged.¿FN1º The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a brief in opposition to the respondent’s appeal. The appeal will be sustained in part, and the record will be remanded.
 
The respondent argues that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance by conceding the charge of removability and that the Immigration Judge should have found that he is not removable pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(A), with reference to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i), of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(1)(A), 1182(a)(6)(C)(i). We find, however, that the respondent’s prior attorney conceded removability, as so charged, and that concession of removability is binding on the respondent. See Tr. at 15, 19; Hoodho v. Holder, 558 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir. 2009) (holding that “facts admitted by a party are ‘judicial admissions that bind th¿atº ¿partyº throughout th¿eº litigation.”’). While the respondent claims ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not complied with the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The respondent argues in the alternative that the Immigration Judge should not have pretermitted his application for adjustment of status. The Immigration Judge pretermitted the application, finding that the respondent did not meet the threshold requirement for statutory eligibility to demonstrate that he is not likely to become a public charge and thus would not be inadmissible to the United States. In particular, the respondent submitted an Affidavit of Support (Form I-864) with his spouse as his sponsor. The Immigration Judge concluded that the income his spouse listed on the form does not meet the minimum household income requirement based on the DHS attorney’s statement that the 2008 poverty guidelines for a family of four require an income of $26,500 (Tr. at 27). The respondent argues that the Affidavit of Support met the threshold requirement because it included his income in addition to his wife’s income.
 
*2 An affidavit of support is sufficient if it demonstrates that a sponsor’s:
reasonably expected household income for the year in which the intending immigrant filed the application for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status … would equal at least 125 percent of the Federal poverty line for the sponsor’s household size as defined in 8 CFR 213a.1, under the Poverty Guidelines in effect when the intending immigrant filed the application for an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status ….
 
8 C.F.R. § 213a.2(c)(2)(ii)(C). Under the regulations, “household income” is defined as “the income used to determine whether the sponsor meets the minimum income requirements under sections 213A(f)(1)(E), 213A(f)(3), or 213A(f)(5) of the Act” and includes the income of the sponsor, and of the sponsor’s spouse and any other person included in determining the sponsor’s household size, if the spouse or other person is at least 18 years old and has signed a Form I-864A. 8 C.F.R. § 213a.1. The “household income may not include the income of the intending immigrant, “unless the intending immigrant is either the sponsor’s spouse or has the same principal residence as the sponsor and the preponderance of the evidence shows that the intending immigrant’s income results from the intending immigrant’s lawful employment in the United States or from some other lawful source that will continue to be available to the intending immigrant after he or she acquires permanent resident status.” 8 C.F.R. § 213a.1 (emphasis added). Further, the instructions to the Form I-864 state that the income requirements can be met using income from the intending immigrant if the income will continue from the same source after he or she becomes a lawful permanent resident.
 
The respondent’s application for adjustment of status (Form I-485) was filed with the Immigration Judge in 2007, and therefore, the sponsor’s “reasonably expected household income” for 2007 is given the greatest evidentiary weight in this case. The Affidavit of Support, filed in 2007, indicates that the current total annual household income is $32,172.10, including the respondent’s income (Respondent’s Application for Adjustment of Status at Attachment 10). The regulations and the instructions to the Form I-864 specifically acknowledge situations where a sponsored alien’s own income may be counted towards meeting the income requirements of the Affidavit of Support. The Immigration Judge did not consider whether the respondent’s income could be included in the sponsor’s household income under the regulations. We find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further fact finding with regard to the Affidavit of Support and to determine whether the respondent is otherwise statutorily eligible for, as well as deserving of, adjustment of status. We note that if more than 1 year has elapsed since the submission of the Form I-864 the regulations provide the Immigration Judge with the discretion to request more current information if necessary to the proper adjudication of the case. 8 C.F.R. § 213a.2(a)(1)(v)(B).
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained in part.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alexandra Kostich
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On October 9, 2009, the Board denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider the Board’s prior decision denying his motion to reopen. On November 5, 2009, the respondent filed another motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition to the motion, and the respondent has filed a reply. The motion will be denied.
 
With certain exceptions, an alien is entitled to file only one motion to reopen and the motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s motion to reopen is number-barred and is also untimely because it was not filed within 90 days of the final administrative order of removal, which was entered on May 27, 2008. Furthermore, the respondent has not shown that his motion falls within an exception to the filing requirements and has not demonstrated that reopening sua sponte is warranted. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (the Board’s discretion to reopen sua sponte is limited to cases in which an exceptional situation is demonstrated). The respondent claims to have new evidence to support his prior allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, he has not explained how the evidence is relevant.
 
The respondent has submitted attorney billing records that he claims demonstrate that his former counsel was not truthful in her statements to the Immigration Judge. He asks the Board to compare the billing records (Exh. BB) with the transcript of his hearing (Exh. AA). The respondent appears to believe that his former attorney’s statements to the Immigration Judge conflict with the billing records.
 
The transcript in the record before us shows that during the respondent’s hearing the former counsel was instructed by the Immigration Judge to contact the United States Attorney’s Office and to speak with their financial litigation unit to request a statement regarding a restitution arrangement for the respondent (Tr. at 200). The former attorney was instructed to advise that office that the statement of the arrangement was needed in the Immigration Court and that if it were not provided, the attorney should document that fact (Tr. at 200). The former attorney inquired as to whether she could provide an affidavit saying she contacted “this person” (Tr. at 200). She was asked if she had done so yet, and the former attorney responded, “not yet” (Tr. at 200). The respondent contends that the former attorney was untruthful to the Immigration Judge because the former attorney had previously billed the respondent for calling and speaking to Aria Adriana at the United States District Court regarding the respondent’s restitution payment history statement (Exh. BB).
 
*2 The evidence presented does not establish that the former attorney was untruthful to the Immigration Judge. The former attorney’s billing records document her contact with the United States District Court regarding a payment history statement, but not the United States Attorney’s Office financial litigation unit regarding a payment arrangement. Furthermore, the respondent has not shown how his former attorney’s telephone contacts or statements to the Immigration Judge are relevant to his case. The respondent does not contend that he made restitution payments for which he was not credited in the Immigration Judge’s analysis.
 
The respondent has also attached to his motion documents filed in association with a bar complaint against his former counsel. However, we have already addressed the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim and the respondent has not established any exceptional situation that would warrant further consideration of this issue.
 
Given that the respondent has provided no exceptional situation to support sua sponte reopening, his untimely, number-barred motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pascual Madrigal, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Justin Adams
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision of March 10, 2010, denying his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) (the “Act”). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493, 497 (BIA 2008). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); see also Matter of Almanza-Arenas, 24 I&N Dec. 771, 775 (BIA 2009).
 
The Immigration Judge first determined that the respondent had not met his burden of proving statutory eligibility for cancellation of removal, given his inconclusive proof as to the date he was admitted as a temporary permanent resident (I.J. at 3-5). The Immigration Judge next made the discretionary determination that, after weighing the respondent’s long list of arrests and convictions against his positive equities, the respondent failed to prove his continued desirability as a resident of the United States (I.J. at 5-8).
 
The respondent first argues that he demonstrated statutory eligibility for the form of relief requested, given that no offense occurred within 7 years of his admission on May 4, 1988. The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge erred in considering the respondent’s arrest for robbery as a negative discretionary factor because no records were available to show the disposition of the case. Finally, the respondent argues that his attorney’s failure to advise him of the need to have an I-130 petition filed by his common law wife after divorcing his present wife constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. We will address each argument in turn.
 
Even assuming that the respondent satisfied the three statutory prerequisites for relief under section 240A(a) of the Act, he also must also establish that he warrants such relief as a matter of discretion. Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998). The respondent has not done so. Rather, the Immigration Judge properly balanced the negative factors and positive equities in determining that the respondent did not merit a grant of relief in the exercise of discretion. The Immigration Judge considered, inter alia, the respondent’s long residence in the United States and work history, as well as his girlfriend’s serious medical condition, but found that his criminal record, including convictions of aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury and possession of cocaine, outweighed these factors (I.J. at 6-7; Tr. at 45-49). Although the respondent assigns error to the consideration of his arrest for robbery, this is only one among a list of offenses that weigh against granting cancellation of removal. The respondent presented no evidence here that effectively offset unfavorable factors. Therefore, we agree that the respondent has failed to demonstrate his continued desirability as a resident of the United States.
 
*2 Lastly, the respondent’s allegation regarding deficient advice has not established a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, as he has failed to comply with the standards set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Heather Moretzsohn
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Warren R. Kaufman
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on September 9, 2009, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s October 1, 2008, decision finding the respondent removable as charged, ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility, and lacking good cause for a continuance to pursue adjustment of status. Therein, we also denied his motion to remand the record for further proceedings. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings on December 10, 2009. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen shall not be granted unless it appears that the evidence sought to be offered “was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Further, this Board has held that a party who seeks to reopen proceedings to pursue a discretionary grant of relief from removal bears a “heavy burden” of demonstrating that if his motion to reopen were granted, the new evidence presented would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
In his motion, the respondent argues that he was eligible for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act, and that the Immigration Judge “denied the respondent due process by not allowing him the opportunity to apply for the waiver.”¿FN1º With his motion, the respondent has submitted evidence in support of his request for such relief, including his own affidavit, a Form I-130 approval notice dated February 12, 2009, his wife’s lawful permanent resident card, and evidence of hardship to his qualifying relatives.
 
While the respondent argues that he has presented new facts and evidence, we do not find this evidence new in accordance with 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). While the respondent’s Form I-130 has been approved since the Immigration Judge’s decision, this evidence was available during the pendency of the respondent’s prior motion to remand before the Board, which we denied on September 9, 2009. We also find that the respondent received a full and fair hearing. The Immigration Judge continued the hearing on June 18, 2008, so that the respondent’s attorney might be able to find a “waiver somewhere” for his section 212(a)(6)(E)(I) inadmissibility (Tr. at 17). The Immigration Judge specifically stated that the continuation was granted to give the respondent an “opportunity to prepare” for any applications (Tr. at 18). At the continued hearing on October 1, 2008, the respondent requested a second hearing to await the adjudication of a Form I-130 filed on behalf of the respondent, but the attorney also explained that he had not earlier filed the pending Form I-130 because he was alternatively applying for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(c) of the Act until he “changed (his) mind” in June of 2009 and decided to pursue an adjustment application (Tr. at 27). While the Immigration Judge declined to continue the proceedings again, he did provide “both sides an opportunity to get whatever arguments they may have on the record” and he instructed the respondent’s attorney to “put everything that you can think of on the record” (Tr. at 33). The Immigration Judge, thereafter, found the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal, a section 212(c) waiver of inadmissibility, and adjustment of status because “the respondent pled guilty to … conduct defined in section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act” (I.J. at 8). The respondent has not filed an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and we do not otherwise find that the respondent’s attorney’s tactical decisions illustrate a due process violation on the part of the Immigration Judge.
 
*2 As noted previously, the respondent has provided no new evidence with his motion to reopen; in fact, the respondent also presented his fair hearing argument previously before us, on appeal and in his motion to remand, when arguing that the Immigration Judge failed in granting a continuance to allow him to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(h) of the Act (Bd. Dec. at 3-4). We found, then, “no prejudice to the respondent from any alleged failure of the Immigration Judge to allow the respondent’s counsel to ‘fully analyze the issue.”’ See Matter of Exame, 18 I&N Dec. 303 (BIA 1982). We find, now, that the respondent has twice failed to raise his eligibility for relief under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act, and we find a motion to reopen proceedings an inappropriate venue to present this argument as an initial matter. See Matter of Samai, 17 I&N Dec. 242 (BIA 1980). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

The respondent also continues to argue, briefly, his eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(c) of the Act. We addressed this issue previously in our September 9, 2009, decision, and decline to further address it at this time.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jason Goodchild
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Termination
 
The respondent, a native of the Dominican Republic and a lawful permanent resident of the United States since October 5, 1995, has filed a timely appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 16, 2010. In that decision, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable, as charged, on account of his 2007 New York conviction for the offense of assault in the second degree,¿FN1º which he found to be a conviction for a “crime of violence” aggravated felony, as defined under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F) (Exh. 2). The appeal will be dismissed. The respondent’s request to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is granted under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). See Matter of Chicas, 19 I&N Dec. 114 (BIA 1984).
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2010); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in an appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2010); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008) rev’d on other grounds, Kaplun v. Attorney General of the United States, 602 F.3d 260 (3d Cir. 2010); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The principal issue raised by the respondent on appeal concerns the Immigration Judge’s finding of removability. Upon our de novo review, however, we are not persuaded to disturb the Immigration Judge conclusion that the respondent’s 2007 New York conviction for the offense of assault in the second degree qualifies as a “crime of violence” under 18 U.S.C. § 16,¿FN2º and an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, and that there was no basis to grant the respondent’s request to terminate proceedings. We agree with the Immigration Judge and find that the respondent’s conviction is a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. § 16(b).
 
*2 To determine whether an offense is a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. § 16(b), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, employs a “categorical approach,” which looks to the generic elements of the statutory offense and asks whether the criminal conduct required to violate the applicable statute is “by its nature” a crime of violence. See, e.g., Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, 462 F.3d 456, 463-65 (5th Cir. 2006). In other words, the pertinent question is whether the crime inherently involves a substantial risk that intentional physical force will be used in the commission of the crime.¿FN3º See Leocal v. Ashcroft, supra, at 383 (holding that 18 U.S.C § 16(b) “covers offenses that naturally involve a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical force might be used against another in committing an offense”); see also Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, supra, at 465. Before we may consider whether the respondent’s conviction so qualifies, we must first examine the statutory elements of New York’s assault in the second degree statute.
 
However, before we do so, we note that NY PENAL LAW § 120.05 is a divisible statute - that is, it encompasses offenses that both are and are not crimes of violence. See NY PENAL LAW § 120.05. See generally Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, supra, at 463-65; see also Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 20-21 (2005). Divisible statutes require what is referred to as a “modified categorical approach,” in which we must first look to the record of conviction to determine whether the actual offense of which the alien was convicted qualifies as a crime of violence. See Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, supra. In making this determination, we may consider any of the following documents: the charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented. See id; see also Shepard v. United States, supra.
 
The respondent’s record of conviction reflects that he was convicted of violating subsection 2 of NY PENAL LAW § 120.05. This particular subsection provides that a person is guilty of assault in the second degree when “¿wºith intent to cause physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument” (emphasis added). NY PENAL LAW § 120.05(2). Under New York law, this offense is classified as a class D felony. See NY PENAL LAW § 60.05(5). As such, at the time of the respondent’s conviction, assault in the second degree was punishable by a maximum term of 7 years imprisonment. See NY PENAL LAW § 70.00(2)(d). Because the respondent’s crime was punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of more than 1 year, it also qualifies as a federal felony. See 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(4). Thus, his offense is unquestionably a “felony” within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 16(b). United States v. Villegas-Hernandez, 468 F.3d 874, 884 (5th Cir. 2006).
 
*3 Moreover, we find that the crime for which the respondent was convicted involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property or another may be used because the elements of intent and actual physical injury are both present. Cf. United States v. Calderon-Pena, 383 F.3d 254, 260-61 (5th Cir. 2004) (contrasting crimes that actually involve the use or attempted use of physical force against the person of another with crimes, like child endangerment, that only create a risk of injury). See generally Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, supra.
 
The Fifth Circuit has ruled that, in considering whether an offense is a crime of violence, it is appropriate to determine the “ordinary, usual way the crime is committed,” not whether it is “possible” to commit the offense without the use of physical force. Perez-Munoz v. Keisler, 507 F.3d 357, 364 (5th Cir. 2007) (“Being able to imagine unusual ways the crime could be committed without the use of physical force does not prevent it from qualifying as a crime of violence under § 16(b).”) Although the offense may be committed without physical force actually being used against the person of another, it is evident from the terms of the statute that, in the ordinary case, an individual who commits such an offense necessarily disregards the substantial risk that, in the course of committing it, he might be required to intentionally use physical force against his victims. See James v. United States, 127 S. Ct. 1586 (2007). Therefore the offense, which is a felony under New York law, qualifies as a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. § 16(b), and an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, rendering the removable on that basis. See Leocal v. Ashcroft, supra.
 
Finally, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s appellate contentions that he was denied constitutional due process, first by the Immigration Judge, and secondly, by his former counsel, based on allegations of ineffective assistance in the presentation of his case.
 
Initially, we find no support for the respondent’s claim that he was denied constitutional due process by the Immigration Judge. We have held an alien must demonstrate that he has been prejudiced by a violation of a procedural rule or regulation before his deportation proceeding will be invalidated. Matter of Garcia-Flores, 17 I&N Dec. 325, 329 (BIA 1980). This is consistent with the rule that an alien must have been prejudiced by a procedural defect in his deportation proceeding before he will be found to have suffered a denial of due process. See Ka Fung Chan v. INS, 634 F.2d 248, 258 (5th Cir. 1981). In the matter before us, no such prejudice has been shown. The respondent’s appellate contentions as to “entrapment” and the giving of wrong information by the Immigration Judge are belied by the record. Moreover, the record reflects that the respondent, represented by counsel, had ample opportunity to prepare for and address the removal charges. Finally, to the extent the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge “never allowed ¿himº to excise (sic) ¿hisº rights to the mitigate the facts of ¿hisº case,” ignores the fact that having been convicted of an aggravated felony offense, the respondent is statutorily precluded from establishing his eligibility for almost all forms of relief from removal, including cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3), such that there are no mitigating circumstances for the Immigration Judge to consider.
 
*4 The respondent’s arguments in the nature of collateral attacks on his conviction are not properly before us for consideration, as neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board can entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to determine the guilt or innocence of the respondent. Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996); Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1034 (BIA 1999). The respondent has presented no new evidence to indicate that his 2007 New York conviction for the offense of assault in the second degree, has been overturned, vacated, or expunged; rather, the evidence merely indicates that the respondent’s post judgment motion has been scheduled before a judge.¿FN4º Furthermore, there is no objective evidence in the record to indicate that the respondent was misadvised regarding the potential immigration consequences of his guilty plea. See Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010).
 
The respondent has also raised a claim of denial of due process premised on his allegations of ineffective assistance by his former attorney’s presentation of his case. Where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is made, the Board has found that certain criteria must be met. Specifically, the claim must be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make, counsel must be informed of the allegations against him and provided an opportunity to respond, and the respondent must indicate whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2006) (citing Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-498 (5 th Cir. 2000) (upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada)). We note the respondent here has failed to meet any of the criteria set forth in Lozada, in order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Nonetheless, we find that there is nothing in the record, nor has the respondent provided any evidence, to suggest that his former counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair.
 
Based on the record before us, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is subject to removal from the United States based on the respondent’s admissions and record of conviction (Exh. 2). See section 240(c)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A). Moreover, having expressed no fear of persecution or torture if returned to the Dominican Republic, the respondent has failed to establish his eligibility for any relief from removal, including cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a)(3) of the Act. See section 240(c)(4)(A)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d).
 
*5 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

1

The record reflects that on March 8, 2007, the respondent was convicted in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, of the offense of assault in the second degree, in violation of NY PENAL LAW § 120.05(2), for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years (Exh.2).

2

Under 18 U.S.C. § 16, the term “crime of violence” means either “(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or (b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.”

3

To illustrate the intended reach of 18 U.S.C. § 16(b), in Leocal the Court explained how that section would apply to the crime of burglary. “A burglary would be covered under § 16(b) not because the offense can be committed in a generally reckless way or because someone may be injured, but because burglary, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victim in completing the crime.” Leocal v. Ashcroft, supra.

4

Notwithstanding, we note that in the Fifth Circuit the pendency of a direct appeal has no effect on the validity of a criminal conviction for immigration purposes. Garcia-Maldonado v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 284, 290-91 (5 th Cir. 2007); Moosa v. INS, 171 F.3d 994, 1009 (5th Cir. 1999); see also Puello v. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Servs., 511 F.3d 324, 332 (2d Cir. 2007); United States v. Saenz-Gomez, 472 F.3d 791, 794 (10th Cir. 2007); Montenegro v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 1035, 1037 (7th Cir. 2004) (per curiam). Thus, even assuming arguendo that the respondent’s 2007 New York conviction for the offense of assault in the second degree was pending on direct appeal, and not on a motion for post-conviction relief, in the jurisdiction of the Fifth Circuit, this would not prevent it from being used as the factual predicate for an order of removal or a determination of statutory ineligibility for relief from removal.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher Howell, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 11, 2010. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On appeal, the respondent requests remand on the grounds that the conviction, which serves as the basis for removal, and which renders him ineligible for relief from removal, has now been vacated. The respondent has offered a certified copy of a court document issued by the Superior Court of New Jersey that says his request to withdraw his guilty plea was granted. The petition alleges that ineffective assistance of counsel and diminished capacity are the basis for the requested withdrawal of the plea.
 
A conviction vacated on the merits -- because of legal or constitutional defect, including the failure to advise the defendant of the immigration consequences of his plea -- is not a conviction for purposes of deportation or removal. However, a conviction vacated solely because of its immigration consequences remains a conviction for immigration purposes. See Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006); Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003); Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I&N Dec. 1378 (BIA 2000). The burden is on the alien to show the reason the conviction was vacated. See Matter of Chavez, 24 I&N Dec. 272 (BIA 2007). Consequently, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge to enable her to determine the basis that the conviction was vacated.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrew P. Johnson, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On November 23, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings in which he claims to have received ineffective assistance of counsel. He contends that his former counsel failed to notify him about his immigration court hearing until the night before, when it was too late for the respondent to make the trip from New York to Atlanta. The respondent’s failure to attend his hearing led to his being ordered removed in absentia. The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a reply to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must substantially comply with the requirements set out in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1221-23 (11th Cir. 2003). In Lozada, we required: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639.
 
The respondent’s motion states that he has filed a bar complaint against his former counsel and that a copy has been included with the motion as Exhibit F (Mot. at ¶ 19). The motion also states that the former attorney has been sent a copy of the bar complaint (Mot. at ¶ 22). However, the motion before us has no copy of a bar complaint and no Exhibit F. Nor is there evidence to show that the respondent’s former counsel has been advised of the allegations against him. Because the motion to reopen does not substantially comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, the motion will be denied. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., supra, at 1221-23 (11th Cir. 2003).
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bindhu Vijayan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Leslie S. Evans
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on August 26, 2009, when we denied the respondent’s untimely filed motion to reopen proceedings. On November 24, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen in which he alleged ineffective assistance by his prior attorney because that attorney failed to file a timely motion to reopen after the respondent advised the attorney that he planned to marry a United States citizen. The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
With certain exceptions, an alien is entitled to file only one motion to reopen and the motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s motion is a second motion to reopen and was filed more than 3 years after this Board’s final administrative order, which was entered on August 4, 2006. The respondent’s motion is untimely and number-barred unless it falls within an exception to the filing requirements.
 
Under the controlling law of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, aliens raising ineffective assistance of counsel claims in a motion may have the time limits on motions equitably tolled. See Iavorski v. U.S. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 129-33 (2d Cir. 2000). “In a situation where fraud or concealment of the existence of a claim prevents an individual from timely filing, equitable tolling of a statute of limitations is permitted until the fraud or concealment is, or should have been, discovered by a reasonable person in the situation.” Id. at 134.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must substantially comply with the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that the following requirements apply: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The Second Circuit has held that an alien who has failed to comply substantially with the Lozada requirements in a motion to reopen before the Board forfeits his or her ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the court of appeals. See Jian Yun Zheng v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005).
 
*2 The respondent’s motion does not reflect that the respondent has informed his former counsel of the allegations leveled against him and that the former counsel has been given an opportunity to respond. Thus, the respondent has not met an important requirement for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639 (given the potential for abuse, the alien’s former counsel must be given an opportunity to present his version of events if he so chooses).
 
The respondent’s motion also does not include a detailed statement concerning the agreement the respondent entered into with his former counsel. The respondent’s affidavit states that he advised his former counsel that he planned to marry a United States citizen. However, the respondent does not set out any details about what occurred after he actually married or what his agreement was with his former counsel once the marriage took place. The respondent’s affidavit does not even specifically indicate that he was in contact with his former attorney between the time of the marriage and the end of the 90-day period during which a timely motion to reopen could have been filed.
 
Additionally, the respondent has not established prejudice. The record reflects that the visa petition filed on behalf of the respondent by his United States citizen wife was ultimately denied on May 13, 2009, because the couple did not attend their interview. Accordingly, the respondent has not shown that the actions of his former counsel actually affected the outcome of his case. The respondent’s motion, which was filed by new counsel, states that the respondent was specifically told by his former attorney not to attend his “Stokes interview” (Mot. at 3). However, the respondent’s attached affidavit does not include this allegation (Exh. B). Nor is there other evidence included with the motion to support a claim that the former attorney had a role in the denial of the visa petition.¿FN1º Without an approved visa petition, the respondent cannot adjust his status. Thus, the former attorney’s failure to file a timely motion to reopen for the purpose of seeking adjustment of status has not been shown to have resulted in prejudice.
 
Because the respondent has not substantially complied with the requirements of Lozada and has not established prejudice, his motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stephen A. Lagana, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s June 3, 2008, decision denying her motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. A motion to reopen before an Immigration Judge must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order of removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). In the instant case, the respondent’s motion would have been due on or before May 31, 2005. However, the respondent did not file her motion to reopen until April 14, 2008.
 
For an alien raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the untimeliness of the motion may possibly be excused under the doctrine of equitable tolling if the alien establishes that he or she exercised due diligence. See Iavorski v. United States INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000). We find that the respondent has not exercised due diligence in this case. Id. In her motion to reopen, the respondent maintains that her former counsel advised her that she did not need to appear for her master calendar hearing on March 2, 2005, because he filed a motion to change venue on her behalf. The respondent knew or should have known of her counsel’s ineffective assistance when she was ordered removed in absentia on March 2, 2005, but waited more than 3 years to file her motion. We conclude that these facts do not support a finding that the respondent has acted with due diligence. Consequently, we find that the respondent’s motion is not subject to equitable tolling and is untimely.
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sara Elizabeth Dill, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William E. Lore
Senior Attorney
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision mailed on April 24, 2009, that denied his motion to reopen based on his removal from the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) supports the decision of the Immigration Judge. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
On December 28, 2005, an Immigration Judge issued a final order in the respondent’s case. The then-detained respondent was granted a period of voluntary departure “under safeguards” until January 26, 2006, with an alternate order of removal to Jamaica. The respondent waived the right to appeal to the Board. On December 31, 2005, respondent’s prior counsel mailed the DHS the documents necessary to effectuate the respondent’s departure. As it developed, however, the respondent was unable to depart “under safeguards” because on January 10, 2006, the DHS was obliged to turn him over to Pennsylvania state authorities for criminal prosecution. On June 6, 2006, the respondent was convicted of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to deliver and was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of not less than two years. On September 24, 2007, upon completion of his sentence and long after his period of voluntary departure expired, the respondent was removed from the United States to Jamaica.
 
Years later, on April 21, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. The motion sought, inter alia, to have the Immigration Judge vacate the prior order of removal so that the respondent could voluntarily depart, or seek adjustment of status. The motion revealed that the respondent either entered or sought to reenter the United States sometime before May 28, 2008.¿FN1º The Immigration Judge ultimately found that he lacked jurisdiction over the motion due to the respondent’s removal from the United States. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge properly found himself without jurisdiction over the motion. In Matter of Armendarez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008), the Board held that it lacks jurisdiction to reopen proceedings if the alien departed after those administrative proceedings were completed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d). The Board in Matter of Armendarez, supra, recognized that 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) imposed a similar departure bar rule to motions filed before Immigration Judges. The respondent argues that the Board’s interpretation of its regulations has been invalidated in certain circuit court decisions (Respondent’s Br. at 15). As the Immigration Judge correctly observed, however, I.J. at 2, jurisdiction over this case rests with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and “… the Third Circuit has not held that 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), or any similar regulations, are invalid.” Accordingly, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s jurisdictional ruling.
 
*2 We separately note, however, that the respondent’s motion was long since untimely filed. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent urges that the proceedings nonetheless should be reopened sua sponte. However, we find no exceptional circumstances that would warrant the sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997)(stating that “¿tºhe power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”).
 
We note that the Immigration Judge properly determined that Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U.S. 1, 128 S.Ct. 2307, 2320 (2008), did not require a different result in this case, as the Supreme Court specifically declined to address 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d), the regulation deeming a motion to reopen filed with the Board withdrawn when the alien departs the United States. Moreover, the Immigration Judge properly considered, Dada v. Mukasey, supra, concerned a situation where the alien sought to withdraw a voluntary departure request prior to its expiration. This is not the situation with the respondent.
 
The respondent’s brief argues that the departure bar rule should not apply to him because he was “physically unable to comply with his voluntary departure order” (Respondent’s Br. at 11-13, 15-17, 19). However, at the time that voluntary departure period expired on January 26, 2006, the respondent was not detained by the DHS, but by state authorities concerning a criminal charge (Respondent’s Br. at 2, Exh. H). Thus, the respondent was not prevented from voluntarily departing by the DHS. The respondent urges that he did not fail to depart “voluntarily”, citing Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87 (BIA 2007). However, this is not a case where the failure to depart was “through no fault of his … own.” Id at 94. Rather, the respondent’s inability to voluntarily depart resulted from his own criminal misconduct that lead to his conviction and two-year sentence of imprisonment.
 
When the voluntary departure period expired, the respondent (after serving time in prison for a criminal conviction) was properly removed to Jamaica based on the alternate order of removal entered by the Immigration Judge on December 28, 2005. See Respondent’s Br. at 2; Chedid v. Holder, 573 F.3d 33, 34 (1st Cir. 2009)(Immigration Judge granted voluntary departure, with an alternate order of removal, “in case Chedid failed to comply with the grant of voluntary departure by the deadline …”); Mambwe v. Holder, 572 F.3d 540, 546 (8th Cir. 2009)(voluntary departure period granted, after which the alternate order of removal would take effect).
 
*3 Although the respondent argues on appeal that he was “never given the chance to defend his case or present evidence,” Respondent’s Br. at 13, in fact he appeared before an Immigration Judge on December 28, 2005, who issued the removal order.¿FN2º
 
The respondent also wrongly claims that he was not given notice of the removal order, and his right to due process was thereby violated (Respondent’s Br. at 17-19). In fact, the Immigration Judge rendered an oral decision on December 28, 2005, and a summary of her order was provided to the respondent or his counsel.
 
The respondent’s motion and brief alternatively argue that the untimeliness of his motion should be excused because he received ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the motion did not comply with the procedural requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Further, the respondent’s filing, which is unsupported by his own affidavit and leaves various relevant dates unspecified, does not adequately show that he acted with diligence such that the motions deadline should be tolled.¿FN3º See Mahmood v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 248, 252 (3d Cir. 2005) (party in immigration proceedings who brings an untimely motion to reopen claiming that he has received ineffective assistance of counsel must show that he acted with diligence before equitable tolling will extend the filing deadline).
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed because we agree with the decision of the Immigration Judge. However, even if the provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) were not found applicable, his motion would be properly denied as untimely filed.
 
ORDER: The decision of the Immigration Judge is affirmed.

The respondent’s motion and subsequent filings do not reflect the actual date of the respondent’s return. The respondent indicates, however, that he has been convicted for “reentry after deportation.”

2

The respondent’s brief also states or implies, incorrectly, that his removal hearing was issued in absentia (Respondent’s Br. at 13, 17, 26).

3

We know from the documents presented that the respondent returned to the United States at some point before May 28, 2008, and did not file his motion with the Immigration Judge until April 21, 2009.

IN RE: ANAI MELLADO-QUINTANILLA
File: AXXX XX6 885 - New York, NY

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rodney R. Youman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jessica K. Mufarreh
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Removability; termination of proceedings
 
*1 The respondent appeals an Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 28, 2008, denying her motion to suppress evidence and terminate proceedings, and finding her removable as charged. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed an opposition. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including the determination of credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of H-L-H- & Z-Y-Z-, 25 I&N Dec. 209, 211 (BIA 2010).
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her motion to suppress and exclude evidence allegedly obtained or derived from unlawful interrogations conducted by the DHS at her residence on May 8, 2007, and at DHS offices on May 15, 2007 (I.J. at 4). As the respondent’s contentions lack merit, we adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to suppress and exclude evidence for the reasons stated within his decision. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994).
 
Even without considering the respondent’s arrest by the DHS, she is removable under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. Absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission, including tactical actions, made before, during or even after a proceeding, by an attorney acting in his or her professional capacity, binds his or her client as a judicial admission. Ali v. Reno, 22 F.3d 442, 446 (2d Cir. 1994); see also Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938 (BIA 1995); Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986). At removal proceedings on March 25, 2008, the respondent, through counsel, conceded to removability as charged in the Notice to Appear (“NTA”) (I.J. at 1-2, 9; Tr, at 20, 31). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.10(c), (d).¿FN1º
 
The respondent failed to establish that her previous concession to removability as charged at the hearing on March 25, 2008, should be modified due to egregious circumstances. The respondent does not claim ineffective assistance of counsel in conceding removability. See Hoodho v. Holder, 558 F.3d 184, 192 (2d Cir. 2009) (circumstances not egregious where Immigration Judge accepts concession of removability from retained counsel and concession not plainly contradicted by record evidence). As such, the DHS has established the respondent’s removability by clear and convincing evidence. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.8(c), 1240.10(c).
 
*2 The exclusionary rule does not generally apply in civil removal hearings. INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032 (1984); Montero v. INS, 124 F.3d 381 (2d Cir. 1997); Matter of Sandoval, 17 I&N Dec. 70 (BIA 1979). The exclusionary rule may apply, however, if there are egregious violations of the Fourth Amendment or other liberties that might transgress notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the probative value of the evidence obtained. INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, supra, at 1032, 1050-51 n.5; Almeida-Amaral v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 231, 235 (2d Cir. 2006) (exclusion of evidence appropriate where (a) egregious violation that was fundamentally unfair occurred, or (b) the violation - regardless of its egregiousness or unfairness - undermined reliability of evidence in dispute).
 
The respondent failed to establish that evidence should be excluded in these proceedings because she has not shown that the conduct in question was egregious or undermined the reliability of the evidence in dispute. After immigration officers entered the home of the respondent and her partner on May 8, 2007, they searched the premises, stated that they were looking for someone else, and asked the respondent and her partner for identification (Tr. at 39-41; I.J. at 3). See section 287(a)(1) of the Act. Her partner was then taken that day to DHS offices for further questioning, lasting about 3 hours (Tr. at 41, 46; I.J. at 3). Upon his return, the respondent’s partner gave her a notice indicating that she had to appear at DHS offices for questioning herself, on May 15, 2007 (Tr. at 41, 46; I.J. at 3-4). The respondent voluntarily appeared at the DHS offices on that date, whereupon she was questioned for approximately 30 minutes (Tr. at 41-44; I.J. at 4). After this session, the respondent was photographed, fingerprinted, and kept in a cell before being released the same day (Tr. at 44-45; I.J. at 4-5).
 
There is no indication that the respondent was beaten or otherwise physically mistreated during the DHS visit to her home on May 8, 2007, or when she appeared at DHS offices on May 15, 2007 (Tr. at 62; I.J. at 4). The record also does not reflect that her answers to the DHS’s questioning were involuntary or coerced. Although she had a nearly a full week to seek legal counsel, she did not challenge the DHS notice she was given by her partner on May 8, 2007 (Tr. at 51; I.J. at 4). In short, the respondent’s assertions do not provide a basis to exclude evidence in these proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 287.8(b) (relating to standards for interrogation and detention not amounting to arrest).
 
Even assuming the respondent had actually been arrested on May 8, 2007, or on May 15, 2007, regardless of how an arrest is effected, deportation will still be possible when evidence not derived directly from the arrest is sufficient to support deportation. INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, supra, at 1043; see also Matter of Cervantes-Torres, 21 I&N Dec. 351, 353 (BIA 1996) (once alien placed in proceedings, evidence from independent source may be utilized); Matter of Sandoval, supra. The respondent’s latter concession of removability, made through counsel before the Immigration Judge, was obtained more than 9 months after her DHS interrogation session on May 15, 2007, and independent from the actions of the DHS.
 
*3 Further, the mere fact that the respondent may have been placed in proceedings as a result of an allegedly illegal questioning has no beating on her subsequent removal proceedings, which look prospectively to the alien’s right to remain in this country. INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, supra, at 1039-40; see also Katris v. INS, 562 F.2d 866 (2d Cir. 1977) (illegal arrest of alien unlawfully in the United States does not void subsequent deportation order based on alien’s admission of his status at the hearing); Avila-Gallegos v. INS, 525 F.2d 666 (2d Cir. 1975) (a technically defective arrest does not necessarily render deportation proceedings null and void). Therefore, the respondent has not established that evidence should have been suppressed or that proceedings should have been terminated.
 
Due to our disposition of this matter, we need not address any other contentions remaining on appeal. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: SOK KUAN LEI
File: AXXX XX1 487 - Los Angeles, CA
May 27, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kathleen S. Koh, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 29, 2009. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider the denial of her motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia. On appeal, the respondent argues that “¿tºhe Immigration Judge erred in finding that the respondent did not present extraordinary circumstances (medical illness and ineffective assistance of counsel) that prevented her from appearing for her master hearing.” The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
A motion to reconsider is a request that the Board or the Immigration Judge reexamine the previous decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked, while a motion to reopen is usually based upon new evidence or a change in factual circumstances. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 n.1 (BIA 1991). As the Immigration Judge recognized, despite being characterized as a motion to reconsider, the respondent’s motion did not specify errors of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s prior decision, based on the evidence that was previously presented to the Immigration Judge, but rather sought to present evidence, such as a doctor’s letter, evidence of an approved visa petition (Form I-130) and documentation regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, not previously submitted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2). As the respondent’s motion did not specify errors of law or fact in the Immigration Judge’s prior decision based on evidence previously presented, the motion to reconsider was properly denied by the Immigration Judge.
 
Inasmuch as the respondent sought to present evidence that was not previously submitted, the motion is properly characterized as a motion to reopen. However, the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(4) provides that a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings where the party is the subject of an in absentia order of removal. In this matter, the respondent previously filed a motion to reopen, which was denied by the Immigration Judge on February 19, 2009. Hence, we decline to reopen for consideration of the doctor’s letter or evidence of the approved I-130.
 
*2 Lastly, to the extent that the respondent argued in her motion to reconsider that the Immigration Judge should have permitted the respondent to comply with the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and, J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), given the date of its issuance, we note that on June 3, 2009, the Attorney General vacated the decision in Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, supra. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). Even if the respondent was unaware of the issuance of Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), at the time she filed her motion to reopen, the respondent should have complied with the less rigorous evidentiary requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), which required submission of (i) an affidavit setting forth the agreement between the alien and counsel and the basis for the alleged ineffective assistance claim; (ii) evidence that former counsel was informed of the allegation and was given an opportunity to respond; and (iii) evidence that a complaint was prepared for submission to the appropriate disciplinary authorities.
 
In light of the foregoing, we find that the respondent has failed to demonstrate that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her motion to reconsider. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Randy Alexander, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rubab Z. Razvi
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on March 26, 2008, when we denied the respondent’s timely motion to reopen for adjustment of status because the motion did not satisfy the requirements we set forth in Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002) (allowing reopening of proceedings where a visa petition based on a marriage entered into during proceedings was already pending and there was a completed adjustment application supported by clear and convincing evidence of the bona fides of the marriage).
 
On November 30, 2009, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen premised, in part, on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The instant motion to reopen is time and number barred. See sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § § 1229a(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) (an alien may file one motion to reopen and, with certain exceptions not relevant here, it shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal).
 
However, because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether this case warrants equitable tolling of the time limits on motions to reopen. The Ninth Circuit has held that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
We find equitable tolling is not warranted in this case because the respondent failed to establish that he exercised due diligence during the time he seeks to toll. Prior counsel accepts responsibility for failing to support the respondent’s prior motion with evidence that a visa petition (I-130) had been filed with the Department of Homeland Security’s United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). See Respondent’s Motion, Attachments E and F. But counsel’s admitted mistake has no bearing on the untimeliness of the instant motion. There is no allegation that prior counsel failed to inform the respondent of our March 26, 2008 decision. The instant motion was not filed until 18 months later. The respondent failed to demonstrate that he exercised due diligence during this period.
 
Even if the instant motion had been promptly filed, it is insufficient to support reopening. The respondent seeks reopening to afford him the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). To establish his adjustment eligibility, the respondent must demonstrate that he is admissible within the meaning of section 212(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a). The respondent is inadmissible pursuant to section 212(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act, due to his 1988 forcible rape conviction. He has failed to establish his prima facie eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(h) of the Act, and, consequently, he has failed to establish his prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992) (motion to reopen may be denied based upon the failure to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought). Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alison Dixon, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Justin M. Price
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), will be denied.¿FN1º
 
An Immigration Judge on April 12, 2001, found the respondent subject to removal, and declined to grant a continuance for the respondent to apply for adjustment of status, based on a future marriage to a lawful permanent resident of the United States. The Board affirmed this decision without opinion on September 19, 2002. The respondent, who is from Guatemala, filed a motion to reopen on April 6, 2010. The motion was filed many years out of time. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent appears to concede that he was ineligible for asylum, as time-barred, but blames former counsel for not applying at the removal hearing for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. However, a party claiming that equitable tolling applies to the reopening deadline based on claimed ineffective assistance of counsel must show that he acted with reasonable diligence. Escobar v. Holder, 567 F.3d 466, 480 (9th Cir. 2009); Valeriano v. Gonzales, 474 F.3d 669, 673 (9th Cir. 2007). The respondent fails to provide an adequate reason to justify tolling the motions deadline for such a long period of time. As the DHS argues, the respondent was represented by different counsel on appeal to the Board.
 
The time and number limitations do not apply to a motion to reopen based on changed country conditions. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii)(time and number limits do not apply to motions to reopen “¿tºo apply or reapply for asylum or withholding of deportation based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality … if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing”). The respondent argues that he does not want to return to Guatemala, based on the economic policies of the Guatemalan government in enacting the Central American Fair Trade Agreement in 2006. The evidence presented reflects generalized conditions of economic conditions in Guatemala, which does not establish an exception to the time limitation on motions to reopen based on changed country conditions.
 
The motion to reopen will, therefore, be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent was removed from the United States to Guatemala on April 6, 2010. In Coyt v. Holder, 593 F.3d 902 (9th Cir. 2010), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that the Board may not find a motion withdrawn by operation of law, when the respondent is removed prior to the Board’s ruling on the motion. We note that Coyt involved a motion to reopen that was arguably timely (id. at 907), while the present motion was undeniably untimely, filed over 7 years after the administratively final order. For the reasons discussed above, we deny the respondent’s motion on the merits, and do not reach the applicability of Coyt to the present case.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher B. Jones, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeffrey T. Bubier
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of the Philippines, was ordered removed from the United States on March 12, 2008. He filed a motion to reopen on January 19, 2010. The Immigration Judge denied it on January 28, 2010, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). We decide this appeal de novo.
 
The record reflects that the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed with the Immigration Judge more than 90 days after the date in which the final administrative decision by the Immigration Judge was rendered. The motion is therefore untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of Susma, 22 I&N Dec. 947 (BIA 1999) (holding that a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days after the date of the final administrative decision of the Board or Immigration Judge).
 
The respondent argues on appeal that he was ineffectively represented at his hearing, and the Immigration Judge should have reopened these proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the respondent has not established that his former attorney’s negligence prevented him from filing his motion to reopen in a timely manner. We therefore will not equitably toll the 90-day period to seek reopening even assuming that the respondent was a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel at his hearing. See Mahmood v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 248, 252-53 (3d Cir. 2005) (any equitable tolling of the motions deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf).
 
The respondent further argues on appeal that he was ineffectively represented by his criminal attorney who did not advise him of the immigration consequences of his plea agreement. The respondent has failed to introduce any evidence that his conviction is no longer valid. The Board is not empowered to consider the respondent’s constitutional challenges to the validity of his conviction. We consider the conviction final until a criminal court enters a decision vacating it. See generally Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894 (BIA 1994).
 
*2 The respondent additionally argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion because the Department of Homeland Security has unduly delayed his removal. The Board has no jurisdiction to require the swift removal of the respondent. We further have no authority to reopen these proceedings on account of the alleged undue delay in the respondent’s removal from the United States. We do not find that the respondent has established that reopening of these proceedings is appropriate based on a denial to him of due process. We further will not grant the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen based on his assertion that denying the motion will likely cause both him and his family hardship. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: MIGUEL GUTIERREZ-OCHOA
File: AXXX XX9 049 - Buffalo, NY
May 24, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
L. Manuel Macias, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert P. Levy
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before the Board on June 9, 2009, when we determined that the respondent’s interlocutory appeal became moot upon the Immigration Judge’s decision of May 1, 2009, ordering the respondent removed in absentia. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 24, 2009, denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in characterizing his claim as one of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent claims that his attorney, Mr. L. Manuel Macias, previously filed an appeal with the Board regarding the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to change venue, and Mr. Macias erroneously changed his internal records to indicate that the respondent had no upcoming hearings before the Immigration Court. Mr. Macias claims that the administrative error was his fault and not the fault of the respondent, such that reopening is warranted based on exceptional circumstances, or that the case should be reopened sua sponte.
 
An order issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1).
 
As the respondent’s attorney received notice of the hearing, proper notice was provided to the respondent. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). The respondent did not establish that he failed to appear for the hearing due to “exceptional circumstances,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act. Furthermore, the Board has held that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the respondent of his responsibility to appear, and unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988); Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 1985), aff’d, Patel v. INS, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986).
 
*2 We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). In a decision dated June 3, 2009, the Attorney General determined that the Board and Immigration Judges should apply the pre-Compean standards to all pending and future motions to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, regardless of when such motions were filed. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A.G. 2009). Consequently, in his decision of June 24, 2009, the Immigration Judge correctly applied Lozada when he adjudicated the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
An attorney’s administrative error or his failure to advise a client that a change of venue motion had not been granted and that he must appear for the hearing is not a basis for reopening absent compliance with Lozada. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established ineffective assistance of counsel for his failure to appear. The respondent has not submitted an affidavit asserting that he failed to appear due to ineffective assistance of counsel, nor did he indicate that a disciplinary complaint had been filed against his attorney. The Immigration Judge correctly determined that reopening is not warranted in this matter, as the respondent has made no attempt to comply with the requirements set forth in Lozada.
 
Finally, the respondent requests that the Board exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen his removal proceedings. We find that the facts presented in this case do not warrant an intervention of our sua sponte authority to reopen the proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Laine S. Posel, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider the Board’s October 13, 2009, decision dismissing his appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reconsider. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion.
 
At issue in this case is the respondent’s claim that he failed to attend his scheduled hearing on July 11, 2008, because his initial attorney in this matter, Michael Wallace, told him the wrong date of the hearing and did not give him a copy of the hearing notice that was personally served on counsel while the respondent was outside of the courtroom. With his current motion, the respondent has presented new evidence, in the form of an affidavit from attorney Wallace admitting his mistake in telling the respondent the wrong date of the hearing and in not providing him with a copy of the hearing notice. The respondent has also explained why he has not filed a complaint with the Georgia State Bar. The respondent previously presented evidence that, at the time of his scheduled hearing, he was married to a United States citizen and they had a child who was born in September 2007, and he thus had every reason to attend his hearing.
 
Although the motion is untimely and number-barred, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit does not recognize equitable tolling of the time limits for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, we will nevertheless exercise our discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte under the unique circumstances of this case, especially given that the DHS has stated no opposition to the motion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Ali Abdi v. U.S. Attorney General, 430 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, these proceedings will be reopened, the in absentia order will be vacated, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: These removal proceedings are reopened sua sponte, and the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order entered on July 11, 2008, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and for the entry of a new decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 2, 2009, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and reinstated a period of 60 days’ voluntary departure. On November 3, 2009, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen. The filing of his motion to reopen within the reinstated voluntary departure period automatically terminates the prior grant of voluntary departure. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(e)(1) & (2). The previously-entered voluntary departure order will therefore be vacated. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion.
 
Applicable regulations provide that a motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent urges in his motion that certain evidence pertaining to his father was not submitted because he was advised against it by his attorney, and that there were some deficiencies in the translation of his testimony at the hearing. The respondent, however, despite stating that he would submit evidence later to supplement his motion, has submitted no affidavits or other evidentiary material in support of his motion to reopen. Nor has he identified any particular translation errors or shown how they affected his case. Moreover, we point out that his vague claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not meet any of the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), such that he has properly raised such a claim. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s October 2, 2009, order reinstating voluntary departure is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s alternate order of removal to Macedonia is now in effect.

*1 The final administrative decision was issued by the Board on April 26, 2010, and the Board subsequently granted a stay of removal. The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, has filed a timely motion to reopen and remand the proceedings for consideration of an application for adjustment of status (based on his marriage to a United States citizen) in conjunction with an application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The motion is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel, and the respondent has met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Given the respondent’s submission and the lack of opposition by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the motion to reopen will be granted.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s March 31, 2009, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen an order of removal entered in absentia on March 9, 2006.
 
The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying the motion based on an ineffective assistance of counsel argument because the respondent actually argued in the motion that he had not received proper notice. We agree. The Immigration Judge did not address the respondent’s notice argument at all. In order for the parties to fairly contest the Immigration Judge’s determination on appeal and for this Board to meaningfully review the arguments on appeal, the Immigration Judge must identify and fully explain the reasons for his decision. Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994). This includes an analysis of the relevant arguments being made by the parties. Accordingly, the record will be remanded for consideration of the respondent’s arguments for reopening the in absentia order.
 
Upon remand, the Immigration Judge shall consider the respondent’s arguments pursuant to the latest relevant precedent, allow the parties an opportunity to submit evidence relevant to such an analysis, and issue a new decision. See, e.g., Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674-76 (BIA 2008) (setting forth the standards for determining whether a respondent has presented sufficient evidence to overcome the weaker presumption of delivery that attaches to notices sent by regular mail); Matter of C-R-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 677 (BIA 2008) (holding that the respondent overcame the presumption of delivery of a Notice to Appear sent by regular mail where he submitted an affidavit stating that he did not receive the notice, submitted additional evidence indicating he had an incentive to appear, and exercised due diligence in promptly obtaining counsel and requesting reopening of the proceedings); see also Sembiring v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 981 (9th Cir. 2007) (discussing weaker presumption of delivery of hearing notice sent through regular mail and holding that an unsworn written statement of non-receipt of the notice may be sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery).¿FN1º
 
*2 ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

We understand the respondent to be making a lack of notice argument, not an ineffective assistance of counsel argument. If, however, the respondent makes an ineffective assistance of counsel argument on remand, such a claim must be evaluated under the most recent legal standards. See Matter of Compean Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (vacating Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), and pending the outcome of a rulemaking process, directing the Board and the Immigration Judges to continue to apply the previously established standards for reviewing motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel).

IN RE: MAURICIO ERNESTO MORALES-GARCIA
File: AXXX XX1 812 - Los Angeles, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brenda C. Diaz, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of Guatemala, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on September 9, 2002, after failing to appear at a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on December 29, 2009. The Immigration Judge denied it on February 1, 2010, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). We decide the issues on appeal de novo.
 
The respondent acknowledges on appeal that the Notice of Hearing was mailed to 6141 Hazelton Avenue, Van Nuys, California 91401, the address reflected on his June 18, 2002, motion to change venue. According to the respondent, his former counsel provided an incorrect address therein on his behalf. The respondent denies having received notice of his hearing.
 
The alleged failure of a counsel to provide the Immigration Court with the respondent’s correct address would appear to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, and it perhaps would be an “exceptional circumstance” warranting reopening of these proceedings. However, the respondent must have filed his motion to reopen based on “exceptional circumstances” within 180 days of the order of removal. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). Because a request for reopening based on “exceptional circumstances” was not made within 180 days of the date of the respondent’s order of removal, it is barred from consideration. The respondent has also not satisfied any of the procedural requirements for asserting a claim for reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir. 2004); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 638 (BIA 1988).
 
We do not find that a failure of notice occurred herein. The respondent is not entitled to receive notice of his hearing on account of the failure to provide the Immigration Court with a correct mailing address. See section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(5)(B).
 
The respondent further argues on appeal that the Notice to Appear is not genuine or authentic. We have reviewed the document, and it appears on its face to contain all the indicia of reliability. It contains the factual allegations giving rise to a charge of removability, is issued and signed by an authorized individual, and it is personally served on the respondent. The respondent has not identified any aspect of the Notice to Appear that would suggest that it is not a genuine document issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The DHS is not required, as argued on appeal, to establish the chain of custody of the Notice to Appear. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeffrey T. Bubier
Senior Attorney
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Removability; remand
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 17, 2010, decision finding him removable as charged and ordering him removed to the Dominican Republic. The Department of Homeland Security seeks a summary affirmance. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872 (BIA 1994). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s 2001 conviction for the Attempted Criminal Sale of a Controlled Substance (cocaine) in violation of section 110-220.39 of the New York State Penal Law qualifies as an aggravated felony. Section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B); Evanson v. U.S. Att’y General, 550 F.3d 284, 288 (3d Cir. 2008).
 
The respondent seeks a remand based upon his claim that his criminal case has been reopened, and thus his drug conviction is not final for immigration purposes (Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 4-6). The respondent has submitted new evidence on appeal, including a letter from the Supreme Court of New York County to support his claim. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The new evidence does not indicate that the respondent’s 2001 conviction has been overturned, vacated, or expunged; rather, the evidence merely indicates that the respondent’s post judgment motion has been scheduled before a judge. Therefore, the respondent’s reliance upon Pinho v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 193 (3d Cir. 2005), is misplaced. The respondent also argues on appeal that his guilty plea was involuntary, and he was not advised of his constitutional rights at the time of his guilty plea (Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 6); however, there is no objective evidence in the record to support the respondent’s assertions.
 
*2 The respondent’s arguments are in the nature of collateral attacks on his conviction; however, neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board can entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to determine the guilt or innocence of the respondent. Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996); Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1034 (BIA 1999).
 
The respondent also alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, yet he has not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Mudric v. U.S. Att’y General, 469 F.3d 94, 100 (3d Cir. 2006) (affirming the Board’s denial of a motion to reopen for failure to comply with the procedural requirements of Lozada). Furthermore, there is no objective evidence in the record to indicate that the respondent was misadvised regarding the potential immigration consequences of his guilty plea. See Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010). Accordingly, based upon the evidence in the record, we conclude that the respondent’s conviction is final for immigration purposes and a remand is not warranted.¿FN1º 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). In view of the foregoing, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

On April 5, 2010, the Board received the respondent’s motion to hold his appeal in abeyance, in which he alleges a due process violation, contends that the transcripts of his proceedings are missing, and argues that the Board is unable to fully review the respondent’s claims (see also respondent’s March 17, 2010, motion requesting transcripts). We deny the respondent’s April 5, 2010, motion and note that the record contains all of the transcripts pertaining to the respondent. Additionally, in his April 12, 2010, appeal brief the respondent does not assert that the transcripts are missing or unavailable or that he was unable to prepare his appeal brief due to missing transcripts.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Daniel Thomann, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Daniel Rah
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(B), I&N Act ¿ 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B)º (not sustained)

Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(T), I&N Act ¿ 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(T)º (not sustained)
  
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
 
The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 10, 2009, decision terminating removal proceedings based on the DHS’s failure to sustain the removability charges noticed in the Notice to Appear.¿FN1º The respondent has filed an opposition. We will remand the record for further proceedings.
 
We review findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629, 637 (BIA 2003). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico who adjusted to lawful permanent resident status on July 22, 2003. Section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255. On August 18, 2008, the respondent pled no contest and was convicted of one count of possession with intent to manufacture, distribute or deliver 200 grams or less of tetrahydrocannabinols in violation of WISC. STAT. ANN. § 961.41(lm)(h)(1) (West 2009). The respondent was served with a Notice to Appear on June 25, 2009, that cited the respondent’s August 18, 2008, conviction in the factual allegations, and charged him as removable on the basis of an aggravated felony conviction as defined in section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(B), and a controlled substance conviction. Section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii); Section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i).
 
*2 On September 23, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to withdraw his no contest plea with the Circuit Court for Winnebago County pursuant to WISC. STAT. ANN. § 971.08(2) (West 2009), asserting that he did not appreciate that his no contest plea could result in deportation, and that because he had lived here many years and his family remained here, withdrawal of his plea was warranted in the interest of justice. The respondent’s motion did not assert that he failed to receive the statutory advisals required by § 971.08(2), or that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. On October 23, 2009, the circuit court granted the respondent’s motion, vacated his August 18, 2008, conviction, and amended it to one count of felony bail jumping in violation of WISC. STAT. ANN. § 946.49(1)(b) (West 2009). The respondent was sentenced to 2 years of probation.
 
The minutes of the circuit court’s October 23, 2009, hearing reflect that in granting the respondent’s motion, the court did not dispute the fact that the respondent did not understand that his no contest plea would effect deportation. Nothing in the minutes identifies the statutory basis on which the circuit court granted the motion to withdraw, or any other statutory or factual basis for granting the motion.
 
The DHS bears the burden to prove that an alien’s conviction has been vacated solely to alleviate immigration hardship, and thus remains valid for establishing removability in immigration proceedings. Sandoval v. INS, 240 F.3d 577, 581 (7th Cir. 2001). However, we will remand the record because the Immigration Judge’s factual finding that the vacatur was due to a “constitutional” defect in the respondent’s plea is not supported by the record (I.J. at 4). Nothing in the record indicates that the circuit court vacated the respondent’s conviction due to a constitutional defect. The minutes of the October 23, 2009, hearing reflect that the court did not dispute the fact that the respondent did not appreciate the immigration consequences of his plea (Exh. 5). That does not mean, however, that the court attributed the respondent’s misunderstanding to a constitutional or procedural defect underlying the plea, or that any such defect was the legal basis for the vacatur.
 
The respondent’s motion to withdraw also fails to shed sufficient light on the basis for the vacatur, as the motion raises a constitutional argument and an immigration hardship argument, and we cannot discern from this record which argument, if either, the circuit court relied upon to vacate the conviction. The respondent’s motion contends that his failure to understand the immigration consequences of his plea meant that his plea was not knowing and voluntary. The respondent’s motion also asserts that the interests of justice warrant allowing him to withdraw his plea, as he has lived in the United States for almost his entire life and his entire family resides here as well. The October 23, 2009, hearing minutes do not reflect whether the circuit court’s vacatur was in response to this request from the respondent, which is clearly a request to alleviate the immigration hardships arising from the respondent’s August 18, 2008, conviction.
 
*3 Because we have limited fact-finding ability on appeal, we will remand the record for the Immigration Judge to reassess the facts and decide whether the DHS has met its burden of proving that the circuit court’s vacatur was solely to alleviate the respondent’s expressed immigration hardships. Contrary to the DHS’s argument, our holding in Matter of Chavez-Martinez, 24 I&N Dec. 272 (BIA 2007), at 273, does not apply here. In Matter of Chavez-Martinez, supra, at 273, we held that the respondent had the burden of proving the basis for a vacatur when the issue was raised in the context of the respondent’s motion to reopen. Matter of Chavez-Martinez, supra, at 273. DHS Brief at 8-9. At that “late stage of the proceedings,” the burden was appropriately placed on the respondent. Matter of Chavez-Martinez, supra, at 273.
 
On remand, the parties shall have an opportunity to provide additional evidence regarding the circumstances of the vacatur, including any transcripts of the plea hearing and the October 23, 2009, telephonic hearing before the circuit court. The parties will also have an opportunity to address the effect, if any, of the Supreme Court’s decision in Padilla v. Kentucky, ___ U.S. ___ (2010), on this case.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Murray Hilts, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alec J. Niziolek
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; waiver under former section 212(c) of the Act
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s February 18, 2010, decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings to apply for relief pursuant to former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). The Department of Homeland Security seeks a summary affirmance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872 (BIA 1994). Although the respondent concedes that his motion to reopen is untimely, he claims that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled based upon ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 18). The respondent, however, has not complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and the record does not show that his ineffective assistance claim is legitimate. See Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 588 (9th Cir. 2006).
 
The respondent also contends on appeal that he is eligible for equitable tolling because the Immigration Judge who presided over his 1998 hearing violated due process by failing to advise the respondent of his eligibility for a 212(c) waiver. He also asserts that his appeal waiver was not knowing and voluntary, and a change in the law has resulted in more than a reasonable likelihood that the respondent is eligible for 212(c) relief.
 
We disagree with the respondent’s contentions. See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001); Valeriano v. Gonzales, 474 F.3d 669, 673 (9th Cir. 2007) (alien was not entitled to equitable tolling of limitations period for filing motion to reopen removal proceedings). The Immigration Judge in 1998 applied the law then applicable, which did not extend section 212(c) relief to the respondent. At the time of the hearing, section 212(c) had been repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, and the Supreme Court had not yet issued INS v. St. Cyr, supra. Accordingly, the respondent’s reliance upon United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, 568 F.3d 1139 (9th Cir. 2009), is misplaced and given the respondent’s circumstances and the state of the law in 1998, we do not agree with the respondent’s assertion that the Immigration Judge should have advised the respondent that he might be eligible for section 212(c) relief. Valencia v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 1261 (9th Cir. 2008) (alien lacking apparent eligibility for relief from removal did not have due process right to notice of such relief).
 
*2 The record also does not support the respondent’s claim that his appeal waiver was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. The record contains a bi-lingual “Request for Prompt Removal,” signed by the respondent. The respondent agreed that he would waive appeal of the decision ordering his removal, he would accept the order of removal as final, and that he entered the request “voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.”
 
The respondent has not established that he exercised due diligence in discovering essential information bearing on his claim. The record reflects that although the respondent’s wife contacted attorneys in 1998, 2008, and 2009, there is no evidence to indicate that the respondent or his wife took any actions to resolve the respondent’s immigration status between 1999 and 2007 (see Declarations of Ricardo Perez-Morales and Christina Perez in Support of Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Indictment). Valeriano v. Gonzales, supra, at 673 (for equitable tolling to apply, it is necessary that despite all due diligence, the party invoking equitable tolling is unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of the claim, and the party’s ignorance of the necessary information must have been caused by circumstances beyond the party’s control).
 
The respondent did not file his motion to reopen until November 2009, which is 8 years after the publication of INS v. St. Cyr, 4 years after the statutory deadline for filing a special motion pursuant to 8 C.F.R § 1003.44(h), and 2 years after the publication of Reynoso-Cisneros v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1001, 1002 (9th Cir. 2007) (Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 19-20). See also Lin v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 979 (9th Cir.2007) (regulation did not preclude jurisdiction over motion to reopen filed by alien who had been lawfully removed after the completion of immigration proceedings).
 
In addition, the record does not contain objective and reliable evidence to establish that the respondent pled guilty in 1994 to possession of cocaine base for sale, nor has the respondent demonstrated that he relied on section 212(c) relief at the time of his 1994 conviction. Thus, there is no basis to disturb the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent is not eligible for a 212(c) waiver or any other relief, and the respondent has failed to show a due process violation.
 
The record reflects that the respondent illegally reentered the United States on multiple occasions. Therefore, he is ineligible for reopening pursuant to 8 C.F.R. 1003.44(k)(2). Avila-Sanchez v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir. 2007) (provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(k)(2) are constitutional). Consistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St. Cyr, supra, and the section 212(c) regulation found at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(a), the respondent is precluded from establishing his eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act. Given that the respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for the relief sought, reopening is not warranted. Matter of Gutierrez, 21 I&N Dec. 479, 482 (BIA 1996). In view of the foregoing, the following order shall be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Howard L. Baker, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s timely motion requesting that we reconsider our November 4, 2009, decision denying his motion to reopen will be denied. We rejected the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because it was not asserted against a counsel who represented him in his removal proceedings. The respondent asserts error, arguing that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim was properly made against Mario De Marco as the sole principal of the law firm retained by the respondent. However, we recognize as representatives only those attorneys who have properly submitted a notice of appearance and have personally “practiced” before the Executive Office for Immigration Review as that term is defined in 8 C.F.R. § 1001.1 (i). See 8 C.F.R. § § 1001.1(f), (i), (k), (m); 1240.3, 1292.1, 1292.3, 1292.4. An entry of appearance by an attorney who is associated with a law firm does not equate to representation by the firm at large or its principal(s). The record does not contain a notice of entry of appearance from Mr. De Marco. Further, the motion we denied on November 4, 2009, did not establish that Mr. De Marco either appeared at a hearing or filed or prepared a brief or other document on his behalf. We therefore have no basis to assess an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Mr. De Marco.¿FN1º 8 C.F.R.§ 1001.1(i). Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rashmi N. Patel, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Israel, moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) to reopen proceedings in which we issued our final order on August 13, 2009. We dismissed the appeal of the February 12, 2008, Immigration Judge order denying a continuance and voluntary departure. The motion requests reopening to apply for adjustment of status. However, as noted during the Immigration Judge hearing and in our decision on appeal, the petition filed by the respondent’s spouse was denied by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). In the instant motion, the respondent now argues that the attorney who represented him during the hearing, Sharyn D’Urso, provided ineffective assistance in not filing an appeal with the USCIS. However, the motion does not contain the information that might have warranted an appeal with the USCIS. No evidence of the bona fides of the respondent’s marriage has been provided aside from a self serving affidavit from the respondent (Motion at Tab A).
 
Furthermore, insofar as the motion argues that his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance, the motion also fails to comply with the procedural requirements to establish such a claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). There is a letter to the prior attorney, but no complaint has been filed with the bar authority (see Motion at Tab B). The only explanation for failing to file the bar complaint is that the respondent feared there would be a negative impact on the immigration case. But as the respondent is now represented by current counsel, who also represented him during the immigration appeal process, this explanation is dubious. The respondent has not established that he suffered prejudice as the result of any ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000). The respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for relief warranting reopening. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay is denied as moot.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicole H. Nelson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert F. Peck
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s April 29, 2008, decision denying her motion to reopen. Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen sought reconsideration of her application for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) based upon newly proffered evidence. In order to succeed on a motion to reopen, “the applicant must show that the ¿ profferedº evidence could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” Bhasin v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 977, 984 (9th Cir. 2005); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent has not made such a showing.
 
The respondent maintains, however, that ineffective assistance of prior counsel is to blame for her failure to submit such evidence during her former hearing. In support of her claim, she submitted an affidavit in which prior counsel admits that he had not properly prepared the respondent’s TPS application. Even if the respondent is deemed to have satisfied the procedural requirements for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, see Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934, 937-39 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), the respondent’s motion was properly denied. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the newly proffered evidence would not alter the determination that the respondent had failed to establish her own — as opposed to her family members’ — continuous residence and physical presence in the United States as of, respectively, February 13, 2001, and March 9, 2001. See Matter of Barrientos, 24 I&N Dec. 100 n. 1 (BIA 2007).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
*1 This case was last before us on August 25, 2009, at which time we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and reconsider our previous January 16, 2009, dismissal of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent has now filed a motion on April 9, 2010, which is both untimely and barred by numerical limitations. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
Because the respondent offers no evidence or argument which he was prevented from presenting at his hearing, we find no independent evidence to support his brief mention of a due process violation or an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.¿FN1º See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003); Ortiz v. INS, 179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 1999) (finding that prejudice must be shown for a due process challenge and that prejudice is found when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome). We note, particularly, that the respondent appeared pro se before the Immigration Judge and specifically stated that he would represent himself (Tr. at 13-14). The respondent also appeared pro se before the Board during both his appeal and his prior motion. The respondent has not identified an attorney which he claims misrepresented him, and he does not detail any prejudice therefrom. Accordingy, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew Bray, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Wendy Leifer
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) º - Controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Waiver of inadmissibility
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s July 14, 2008, decision denying his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, has three drug convictions in New York and one drug conviction in New Jersey. The respondent concedes that he is removable under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), but he seeks relief from removal in the form of a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act.
 
Former section 212(c) was repealed on April 1, 1997, long before these proceeding commenced, but the Supreme Court has held that such relief remains available to waive grounds of inadmissibility that are based entirely on criminal convictions arising from plea agreements made before that repeal date. INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). All three of the respondent’s New York convictions resulted from plea agreements made before April 1, 1997, and therefore those convictions can be waived as grounds of inadmissibility under former section 212(c). However, the respondent’s New Jersey conviction presents a more difficult question.
 
On September 28, 1979, a jury in the Superior Court for Essex County, New Jersey, entered a verdict of guilty against the respondent with respect to two crimes: (1) possessing a controlled dangerous substance (marijuana); and (2) possessing a controlled dangerous substance (marijuana) with intent to distribute. After these removal proceedings commenced in 2005, however, the respondent filed a petition for post-conviction relief with the Essex County Superior Court. In response to that petition, the Superior Court issued a June 16, 2006, order vacating the respondent’s 1979 conviction based on ineffective assistance of counsel and then issuing an amended judgment finding him guilty of the same two offenses based on pleas of guilty (rather than a jury verdict). The DHS then amended the charge of removability to reflect this revised conviction date. Under the circumstances, we conclude that the respondent has not demonstrated that his New Jersey drug conviction can be waived as a ground of inadmissibility under former section 212(c).
 
*2 Assuming arguendo that the respondent’s 2006 amended conviction is effective for immigration purposes, we conclude that it cannot be waived as a ground of inadmissibility because the respondent has not demonstrated that it resulted from a plea agreement made before April 1, 1997. See 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(h)(3) (“Section 212(c) relief is not available with respect to convictions arising from plea agreements made on or after April 1, 1997.”); see also Executive Office for Immigration Review; Section 212(c) Relief for Aliens With Certain Criminal Convictions Before April 1, 1997, 69 Fed. Reg. 57826-01, 57830 (September 28, 2004) (“The alien seeking section 212(c) relief has the burden of … establishing the date on which the alien entered into a plea agreement with the prosecution that resulted in the conviction from which section 212(c) relief is sought.”) Despite the respondent’s argument to the contrary, nothing in the Essex County Superior Court’s 2006 amended judgment specifies that his post hoc plea agreement was made before April 1, 1997. The respondent’s creative assertion that he should be deemed to have pled guilty in 1979 requires a suspension of disbelief that we are simply unwilling to indulge. The Superior Court’s 2006 order clearly states that the 1979 conviction was vacated, and then replaced with a new, plea-based conviction for the same crimes.
 
In the alternative, if we assume that the respondent’s original 1979 conviction remains effective, we would still conclude that it cannot be waived as a ground of inadmissibility. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this proceeding arises, has extended the retroactivity rationale of the Supreme Court’s decision in St. Cyr to certain aliens whose convictions arose from jury trials. See Restrepo v. McElroy, 369 F.3d 627, 634-35 (2d Cir. 2004). However, the court has made clear that section 212(c) relief is available to an alien convicted after a jury trial only if the alien makes an “individualized showing” that section 212(c)’s repeal upset his reasonable, reliance-based interest in the continued availability of that relief. Walcott v. Chertoff, 517 F.3d 149, 155 (2d Cir. 2008); Wilson v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 111, 122 (2d Cir. 2006). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had made no such individualized showing (I.J. Dec. at 5-6), and we agree. And while the respondent argues on appeal that the record should be remanded to give him another opportunity to make such an individualized showing, we conclude that he has already had an adequate opportunity to do so.
 
In conclusion, the respondent is removable as charged and has failed to demonstrate that his New Jersey drug conviction can be waived as a ground of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act. The following order shall be issued.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and the Immigration Judge’s order of removal is affirmed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathan Grant
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(G), I&N Act ¿ 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G)º
  
APPLICATION: Waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h)
 
This case was last before us on September 11, 2008, when we granted the Department of Homeland Security’s motion to reopen and remand for further proceedings in light of intervening precedent issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the circuit in which this case arises. After holding additional hearings, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s conviction for petty theft with priors under California Penal Code §§ 484(a) and 666 qualified as an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G), and rendered the respondent removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a))(2)(A)(iii). The Immigration Judge also found the respondent ineligible for any form of relief from removal.
 
The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision. And the DHS has moved for summary affirmance. In addition, the respondent has filed a motion to remand for further proceedings in light of the April 16, 2010, vacatur and re-sentencing for his petty theft conviction. The respondent’s motion to remand will be granted. The DHS’ motion for summary affirmance is denied. And the respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7).
  
I. ARGUMENTS ON APPEAL AND MOTION
 
On appeal, the respondent has not challenged the Immigration Judge’s finding that he is removable as an aggravated felon. The respondent instead contends that the Immigration Judge erred in finding him ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), and in denying him the opportunity to present his evidence in support of this application for relief. The respondent argues that section 212(h) of the Act only precludes those who were admitted to the United States as lawful permanent residents and who were convicted of aggravated felonies from obtaining relief. The respondent maintains that section 212(h) does not preclude those, like him, who simply adjusted their status to that of lawful permanent residents from obtaining relief.¿FN1º The respondent bases his argument on Martinez v. Mukasey, 519 F.3d 532 (5th Cir. 2008).
 
*2 In his motion to remand, the respondent contends that his case should be remanded for further proceedings on the issues of his removability and his eligibility for relief. The respondent argues that the Los Angeles Superior Court vacated his 2006 petty offense conviction, the conviction that provided the basis for the Immigration Judge’s finding of removability, and re-sentenced him to 180 days in custody. Accordingly, the respondent maintains that he is no longer removable as an aggravated felon. And the respondent submitted a minute order and other documents in support of this assertion. See Exhibit I to Respondent’s Brief in Support of Motion to Remand.
  
II. MOTION TO REMAND
 
The respondent’s motion to remand is in the nature of a motion to reopen and therefore the respondent must satisfy the requirements set forth in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) before he may obtain a remand. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992). The respondent has met this burden here in that he has offered new and previously unavailable evidence to suggest that he no longer stands convicted of an offense that qualifies as an aggravated felony. See Exhibit I to Respondent’s Brief in Support of Motion to Remand; see also section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act; Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006) (finding that a conviction vacated for failure of the trial court to advise the alien of the possible immigration consequences of a guilty plea is no longer a valid conviction for immigration purposes).¿FN2º Accordingly, we grant the respondent’s motion to remand, and we remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the respondent’s removability and his eligibility for relief from removal in light of his new evidence. Moreover, because we have granted the respondent’s motion to remand, we find it unnecessary to address, at this time, the arguments he has raised on appeal.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is granted and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order and for the entry of a new decision.

The respondent initially entered this country without inspection in December 1980. He applied for legalization under section 245A of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255a, in 1998 and adjusted his status to that of a lawful temporary resident in May 1988. In September 1989, he adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident.

The respondent’s evidence suggests that the Los Angeles Superior Court vacated the respondent’s prior conviction due to ineffective assistance of counsel at the time of his guilty plea. The respondent then appears to have pled guilty and to have been convicted under the same count, but the court sentenced him to a shorter term of imprisonment.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David K. Wenger, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jason A. Ritter
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s November 4, 2009, decision denying his motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an opposition. The appeal will be sustained, proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded.
 
The relevant procedural history is as follows. The respondent sought to have his removal proceedings continued during the pendency of his wife’s appeal of the denial of her visa petition, of which the respondent is the beneficiary and pursuant to which he could ultimately seek adjustment of status. The Immigration Judge denied his request for a continuance, and the respondent sought and was granted pre-hearing voluntary departure.
 
During the voluntary departure period, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and submitted evidence to support his assertion that his wife’s appeal is likely to be successful, thus warranting a continuance of his proceedings. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen.
 
Thereafter, the respondent retained new counsel and filed a second motion to reopen, the denial of which is the subject of this appeal. This second motion to reopen is based on the allegedly ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The respondent argues that his prior attorneys were deficient in failing to request an interpreter during the proceedings and failing to present available evidence of the bona fides of his marriage.
 
The Board reviews findings of fact, including credibility determinations, under a clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent’s prior attorneys concede that they never asked for an interpreter and never discussed with the respondent the details of voluntary departure before requesting such relief. These actions constitute per se ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent was prejudiced by counsels’ deficient performance because he has shown at least a reasonable possibility of success on the appeal of the denial of the visa petition.
 
Although the respondent’s second motion to reopen is number-barred, the denial of due process arising from the lack of an interpreter and his counsels’ failure to inform him of the nature and consequences of the relief being pursued warrant exercise of our and the Immigration Judge’s authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings. Accordingly, we will sustain the appeal, order the proceedings to be reopened, and remand the record for further proceedings.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and the Immigration Judge’s November 4, August 18, and July 10, 2009, decisions are vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: These removal proceedings shall be reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

Marvin J. Muller III
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Pakistan, appeals the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance and order of removal, and requests that the record be remanded. She claims that her former attorney was ineffective in that he did not assist her in pursuing an application for cancellation of removal. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2009). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent contends that she meets the statutory requirements for cancellation of removal for nonpermanent residents, in that she has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of over 10 years, has been a person of good moral character during that period, and can establish that her removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to her United States citizen mother (Respondent’s Br. at 1). See section 240A(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). She asserts that her prior attorney did not raise the possibility of this form of relief, and when she brought it up, he told her that she had no qualifying relatives and was not eligible. Instead, the attorney pursued a strategy of last resort, requesting continuances until the respondent’s priority date for adjustment of status through her mother became current, or until her husband’s Petition for Alien Worker (Form I-140) was approved (Respondent’s Br. at 8). The Immigration Judge denied the attorney’s last request for a continuance.
 
The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements for claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741 (4th Cir. 2006). Furthermore, we agree with the respondent that she was prejudiced by the actions of her former attorney, Mr. Nielsen. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 560 (BIA 2003). In his response to the respondent’s ethics complaint, Mr. Nielsen acknowledges that he did not file an application for cancellation of removal on the respondent’s behalf, and counseled her against it. Even if he genuinely believed that the respondent would not ultimately prevail on such an application, he did not inform her, or the Immigration Court (Tr. at 13), that her mother was a qualifying relative, and he did not adequately discuss with her the strengths and weaknesses of her case. Moreover, Mr. Nielsen admits that he considered the effect of statements she would make in support of her application on her husband’s eligibility for adjustment of status. Thus, his representation of both the respondent and her husband in these circumstances resulted in a conflict of interest that adversely affected the respondent. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: See. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Relief
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic and a lawful permanent resident of the United States since his admission as an immigrant on or about November 8, 1980, has filed a timely appeal from an Immigration Judge’s February 9, 2010, decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2010); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2010), Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
Upon our de novo review of the issues presented here, we have concluded that the respondent presents no arguments on appeal that would cause us to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision. Based on the record before us, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is subject to removal from the United States based on the respondent’s admissions in this case (Tr. at 10), record of convictions (Group Exh. 2), and concession of removability (Tr. at 10). See section 240(c)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A). Moreover, the respondent has failed to establish his eligibility for any relief from removal, including cancellation of removal¿FN1º under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). See also section 240(c)(4)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d).
 
Finally, we consider that accompanying the appeal, the respondent seeks a remand in order to apply for waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). The requirements for a motion to remand are essentially the same as the requirements for a motion to reopen. Rodriguez v. INS, 841 F.2d 865 (9th Cir. 1987). Specifically, “¿aº motion to reopen ¿or remandº proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). However, the information concerning the health issues affecting his wife and daughter were disclosed by the respondent at the hearing before the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 17). Furthermore, in response to the question posed by the Immigration Judge as to what relief from removal he was seeking, the respondent, through his attorney, stated that “it does not appear that ¿the respondentº is eligible for ¿anyº relief at this point” (Tr. at 11). In addition, the motion must be supported by affidavits, applications for relief and any supporting documentation in order to establish prima facie eligibility for the requested relief upon reopening. Id.
 
*2 Furthermore, to the extent that the respondent may have been prevented from pursuing an application for a section 212(h) waiver by the actions of former counsel, the respondent has not raised the issue of ineffective assistance of former counsel, or complied with the Board’s decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 851 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (setting out the requirements that would support a motion to reopen based on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel). Consequently, as the respondent has not demonstrated that a remand is warranted, the motion to remand will be denied.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
pORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion for a remand is denied.

In this regard we consider that as the respondent was previously granted a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), by another Immigration Judge on November 8, 2002, in prior deportation proceedings, the respondent is statutorily precluded by section 240A(c)(6) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(c)(6), from pursuing an application for cancellation of removal for lawful permanent residents.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William M. Pavlov, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The final administrative decision on the merits was issued on October 31, 2006. A motion to reopen was previously denied on June 17, 2008. The respondent, a native and citizen of Peru, has reported that a petition for review and a petition for rehearing were denied by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the pending motion to reopen, filed on October 30, 2009. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent seeks reopening of proceedings for consideration of adjustment of status. This motion is both untimely and number barred as it was not filed within 90 days of our October 31, 2006, decision on the merits, and is the second motion to reopen filed by the respondent. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). In the current motion, the respondent initially requested reopening of proceedings for adjustment of status based on a visa petition filed in October 2009 on his behalf by his United States citizen wife, whom he married in August 2009. The visa petition remains pending. The respondent subsequently acknowledged that under Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2009), jurisdiction of an application for adjustment of status does not lie with the Board or the Immigration Court. We do not find any basis for reopening for termination or administrative closure to pursue adjustment of status under our sua sponte authority. Id.
 
In the June 17, 2008, decision, the Board previously addressed the respondent’s contentions that he was precluded from timely seeking reopening due to ineffective assistance of former counsel and concluded that he had not met his burden of proving that his former attorney, William A. Fernandez, Esquire, was negligent. We separately found that the motion would have been untimely even had we found it appropriate to equitably toll the period for reopening until he employed another attorney. The respondent did not file a motion for reconsideration of that decision with the Board, and as indicated above, the Second Circuit denied a petition for review. We emphasize that the denial of the first motion to reopen was based a finding that the respondent had not shown negligence of his former counsel, as well as on the failure to exercise due diligence in pursuit of the ineffective assistance claim. As we found that ineffective assistance of the first attorney had not been adequately shown on the facts, there can have been no ineffective assistance of the respondent’s subsequent attorney in the failure to diligently pursue the ineffective assistance of counsel claim set forth in the first motion to reopen as the respondent now alleges.
 
*2 The respondent currently seeks reopening to pursue adjustment of status and has conceded that the Board lacks jurisdiction of such an application. Moreover, as the respondent’s marriage to a United States citizen did not occur until 2009, the respondent’s potential eligibility for adjustment of status did not arise until after the period for timely filing a motion to reopen had expired.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen, which is untimely and number barred, will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Devin Theriot-Orr, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert F. Peck
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)º - Convicted of crime involving moral turpitude
 
Lodged: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
 
Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen his removal proceedings. In our decision dated December 5, 2008, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision which found him removable as charged above and denied his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) ¿1994º. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the respondent’s motion.¿FN1º The motion will be granted.
  
I. JURISDICTION
 
On February 16, 2000, an Immigration Judge issued an in absentia removal order in the respondent’s case. On May 10, 2000, DHS removed the respondent from the United States. On February 25, 2005, an Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s motion to reopen. We find that the Immigration Judge properly found that he had jurisdiction over the respondent’s motion to rescind the in absentia removal order even though he had been removed from the United States on May 10, 2000. See Matter of Armendarez, 24 I&N Dec. 646, 654 n.6 (BIA 2008) (noting that we were referring to motions to reopen other than those seeking rescission of in absentia removal orders; we expressed no opinion on whether an alien’s departure would foreclose the filing of a rescission motion, as rescission can be viewed as vacating the in absentia removal order from the outset). We thus find that we have jurisdiction over the respondent’s present motion to reopen even though he was removed from the United States in 2000.
  
II.. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL CLAIM
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen (filed on December 8, 2009) is untimely. The respondent alleges ineffective assistance of former counsels (Adolfo Ojeda-Casimiro and Amanda Stevens). In Matter of Compean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General directed the Board to continue to apply the previously established standards for reviewing motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel (pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
  
A. The Lozada requirements
 
*2 The respondent shows substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to allege ineffective assistance of Mr. Ojeda-Casimiro and Ms. Stevens. The respondent presents his declaration and the declarations of Mr. Ojeda-Casimiro and Ms. Stevens. We find that the respondent’s failure to file complaints against Mr. Ojeda-Casimiro and Ms. Stevens with appropriate disciplinary authorities is not fatal to his claim under the circumstances presented (as discussed below). See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525-26 (9th Cir. 2000) (the failure to comply with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, is not fatal where the alleged ineffective assistance is plain on the face of the administrative record).
  
B. Prejudice
 
The respondent shows prejudice. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793 (9th Cir. 2005) (the alien must generally show that she was prejudiced by her counsel’s performance).
  
1. Aggravated Felony Charge
 
Mr. Ojeda-Casimiro conceded that the respondent (a lawful permanent resident) was convicted of an aggravated felony in the motion to change venue and again at the July 26, 2005, hearing (Tr. at 2-3). Prior to filing a motion to reconsider on January 5, 2009, Ms. Stevens did not advise the respondent to file a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of Mr. Ojedo-Casimiro or to timely file a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The respondent was convicted of assault in the fourth degree in an Oregon criminal court on November 6, 1995 (Exh. 3). Although not a model of clarity, the conviction record shows “Susp. Imposition¿,º” or imposition of sentence suspended. The conviction record also shows “18 months Formal ¿,º” or 18 months formal probation given. Because the respondent was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least 1 year, the conviction is not an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F). The respondent is thus eligible to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a).
  
2. Crime Involving Moral Turpitude Charges
 
Mr. Ojeda-Casimiro also conceded the two crimes involving moral turpitude charges. The respondent shows prejudice on the charge under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i). In Oregon, assault in the fourth degree is a Class A misdemeanor, and is punishable by a maximum of 1 year in prison. See sections 163.160 (assault in the fourth degree) and 161.615 (prison terms for misdemeanors) of the Oregon Revised Statutes (1995). Because a sentence of 1 year or longer could not be imposed, the conviction is not a deportable offense under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Act. The respondent also shows prejudice on the charge under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act. The conviction fits into the petty offense exception of section 212(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II) of the Act. The maximum penalty possible did not exceed imprisonment for 1 year, and the respondent was not sentenced to any term of imprisonment.
  
C. Due Diligence
 
*3 The respondent shows due diligence. See Ghahremani v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 993, 999-1000 (9th Cir. 2007) (the limitations period is tolled until the alien definitively learns of counsel’s ineffective assistance). The respondent first learned of both former counsels’ ineffective assistance when he met with present counsel on September 28, 2009. See Motion Exh. A at 3. The motion to reopen was filed on December 8, 2009, within 90 days thereafter. We find equitable tolling of the time limit on the motion to reopen is warranted.
 
We will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent shows substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, shows prejudice, and shows due diligence. We will remand to allow the respondent to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act.¿FN2º Relief from removal is still relevant because the respondent remains removable on the charge under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act (present without being admitted or paroled).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Daniela R. Razawi, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Justin M. Price
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order in these proceedings on May 25, 2005, when we affirmed a November 17, 2004, decision in which the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion for a continuance, found him removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, and ordered his removal from the United States. On April 2, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied the respondent’s petition for review of the Board’s decision.¿FN1º See Miranda-Gonzalez v. Holder, 320 Fed. Appx. 807 (9th Cir. 2009). On January 6, 2010, the respondent filed this untimely motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent raises his ineffective assistance of counsel claim against Charles Victor Stebley, Esquire, the attorney who represented him during the removal hearing and on appeal, and who filed the petition for judicial review. The respondent alleges that Attorney Stebley failed to file a written motion with the Immigration Judge to continue the hearing while the respondent pursued a collateral attack on the conviction underlying the charge of removal. See Motion to Reopen at 3.
 
The filing deadline imposed on motions to reopen may be equitably tolled during periods when an alien is prevented from filing because of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. I.N.S., 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). However, the alien must establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of counsel’s ineffective assistance, and that he exercised due diligence in discovering the ineffective assistance. Id. at 897-98. The respondent has failed to meet this burden.
 
Initially, we do not find that the respondent has shown that he suffered prejudice as a result of Attorney Stebley’s handling of his case. Id. The respondent has not identified any form of relief from removal for which he may qualify. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1988) (explaining that a party who seeks a remand or to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case). Nor has he offered evidence that the conviction underlying the charge of removability has been vacated.¿FN2º As such, the respondent has failed to show that he suffered prejudice as a result of any ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. I.N.S., supra, at 899-900.
 
*2 Secondly, and separately, we are not persuaded that the respondent has adequately shown that he exercised due diligence in this matter. The instant motion to reopen was brought before the Board nearly four years after our May 25, 2005, decision. The respondent states that Attorney Stebley mislead him up to the time that he picked up his file on December 19, 2009, for present counsel to review. However, present counsel entered her notice of appearance on the respondent’s before the Ninth Circuit on May 26, 2006, in conjunction with the petition for review of these very proceedings. The respondent raises no claim regarding present counsel and we do not find any adequate explanation for her apparent failure to raise the issue of ineffective representation with her client years ago. The issue of the Immigration Judge’s denial of the continuance, the adequacy of the evidence of removability, and due process concerns were matters raised before the Ninth Circuit. On this record, we not find that the respondent has exercised due diligence in delaying the filing the present motion with the Board until the denial of his petition for review.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied. The related request for a stay of removal pending the disposition of this motion is denied as moot.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Citing Grageda v. INS, 12 F.3d 919 (9th Cir. 1993) (finding that the Immigration Judge properly denied a motion to continue because the alien’s conviction was final, and that the pending collateral attack did not affect the conviction’s finality), the Court found that the Immigration Judge did not violate the respondent’s due process rights by refusing to continue his case.

The respondent has neither claimed nor offered evidence to show that a collateral attack on the conviction has been filed with the criminal court.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William P. Hollerich
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order in these proceedings on September 18, 2008. This case was last before the Board on June 29, 2009, however, when we denied the respondent’s previous motion to reopen and reconsider because it was untimely. On February 26, 2010, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen and reconsider. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.¿FN1º
 
Whether construed as a motion to reopen or as a motion to reconsider, the motion is untimely and number-barred. See sections 240(c)(6)(A), (B) and (7)(A), (C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(b)(2), (c)(2). The respondent does not seek to toll the filing restrictions imposed on this motion. See generally Iturribarria v. I.N.S., 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (recognizing equitable tolling of deadlines and numerical limits on motions to reopen or reconsider during periods when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of ineffective assistance of counsel). Further, it does not appear that any exception to the filing restrictions applies to this case. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3).
 
The respondent stresses his equities in the United States as well as the hardship that will accrue to his family as a result of his removal. He has not, however, demonstrated an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our discretionary authority to reconsider a prior Board decision in this case sua sponte or to reopen his proceedings. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (“As a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen and reconsider will be denied.
 
The following order denying the respondent’s untimely, number-barred motion to reopen and reconsider will be entered.¿FN2º
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and reconsider is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carla C. Prosper, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jane H. Thomson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed an untimely and number-barred motion to reopen her removal proceedings, after the Board on July 29, 2003, dismissed her appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against her on May 3, 2002. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion.
 
The respondent has raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim with regard to her representation below. Upon review of the record, however, we are convinced of an error in our prior decision that warrants sua sponte reconsideration. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Upon reconsideration, we will sustain the appeal and reopen these removal proceedings based on a determination that proper notice of the scheduled removal hearing was not provided in this case, and the in absentia removal order should therefore be rescinded. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C).
 
The basis of the respondent’s motion to reopen below — that notice was not properly provided to her representative of record — was never properly addressed by the Immigration Judge or the Board. Rather, the motion was analyzed primarily as a claim of exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear based on the pending motion for a change of venue, with the Immigration Judge also finding that she had received timely notice through her mother. However, a more careful review of the motion reveals that the respondent claimed in her motion that notice of the scheduled hearing was improper because her attorney had filed a Notice of Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28) but was not served with any decision after filing the Motion to Change Venue on the respondent’s behalf, and that her attorney was not advised that it had been denied even when he contacted the Immigration Court.
 
Section 239(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1), provides that written notice of the proceedings shall be provided to the alien “or to the alien’s counsel of record, if any.” Applicable regulations further provide that “¿wºhenever a person is required … to give or be given notice … such notice … shall be given by or to, served by or upon, made by, or requested of the attorney or representative of record, or the person himself if unrepresented.” 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
In this case, counsel filed a notice of appearance on April 5, 2002, along with a Motion to Change Venue. The record reveals, however, that the Immigration Judge’s April 11, 2002, decision denying the motion was served only on the respondent, not on her counsel of record. In addition, the notice of hearing that was issued on April 11, 2002, was provided only to the respondent, not her attorney of record. Relevant statutes and regulations require that, if an alien is represented, notice must be provided to the alien’s representative of record. That was not done in this case, and the notice was therefore improper.
 
*2 Given the unique circumstances of this case, we therefore find it appropriate to reconsider sua sponte and vacate our prior decision in this case, and to sustain the respondent’s appeal and reopen these proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal based on a lack of proper notice. In view of this decision, we need not address the numerous other issues raised in the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The Board’s July 29, 2003, decision is reconsidered sua sponte and vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained and the Immigration Judge’s June 27, 2002, decision denying the motion to reopen is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, the Immigration Judge’s May 3, 2002, in absentia order of removal is vacated, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ehab Moustafa, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º- In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Egypt, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 4, 2009, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings that were conducted in absentia on January 24, 2006. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings that were conducted in absentia. Specifically, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent did not demonstrate that the in absentia order of removal qualifies for rescission. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); see also section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Nor do we find clear error in the factual findings leading up to that determination. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, an order issued following proceedings conducted in absentia may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed (a) within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that he failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, or (b) at any time if the alien demonstrates he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own.
 
The respondent on appeal does not assert either that he was unaware of or that he did not receive proper notice of his January 24, 2006, hearing that was scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. Instead, the respondent apparently asserts that his failure to timely file a motion alleging exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear is the result of the ineffective assistance of his former attorneys.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely as it was filed well after 180 days, 3 years, after the date of the order of removal and, in any event, establishes no exceptional circumstances that would excuse the respondent’s failure to appear. Moreover, we reject the respondent’s apparent ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Significantly, the respondent on appeal did not submit an affidavit averring to his attorney’s assertion that the respondent’s former attorneys caused or contributed to the delay in filing a motion to reopen. See, e.g., Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (recognizing that statements made by counsel are not evidence). Notably, the respondent’s brief on appeal indicates that the first attorney informed the respondent of the need to file a motion to reopen within a certain time period (Respondent’s brief at 1). In addition, the respondent has not indicated when, after learning about the need to file a motion to reopen, he first contacted the second attorney (although he apparently did not actually hire that attorney until February 2008).
 
*2 We do not find that the respondent’s current attorney’s assertion relating to the ineffectiveness of the respondent’s former attorneys is alone sufficient to demonstrate patent error. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Nor, has the respondent sufficiently complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). Therefore, on this record, and on the facts as found by the Immigration Judge, we decline to set aside the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
Finally, even if the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3) were applicable, the respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was filed well over 90 days, 3 years, after the Immigration Judge’s 2006 order of removal. The respondent has not identified any changed circumstances in Egypt that would have excepted his untimely motion from the applicable time limitations. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Moreover, the “new” evidence relating to the respondent’s approved visa petition does not pertain to any claim of a material change in country conditions in his native Egypt since the Immigration Judge’s decision. Thus, the respondent has failed to show that his motion to reopen falls within an exception to the general time limits. See section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). As a result, the respondent is precluded from seeking reopening to apply for adjustment of status.
 
On the whole, the record supports the Immigration Judge’s resolution. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David Butbul, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
David M. Williams
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º- In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Poland, appeals an Immigration Judge’s March 13, 2008, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. We review the Immigration Judge’s factual findings for clear error and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by denying the respondent’s motion to reopen because the respondent was not aware that she was requesting voluntary departure at her December 18, 2007, hearing. See Respondent’s Brief at 1-2. We disagree.
 
Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1), to obtain reopening, the respondent must show that the evidence she seeks to admit is material, previously unavailable and could not have been discovered or presented at her previous hearing. The respondent has not met this burden. In her motion to reopen, the respondent argued that she believed that, because she received a fingerprint notice dated April 26, 2007, she would be allowed to remain in the United States. See Motion to Reopen at 1-2. Despite this argument, however, the notice was issued eight months prior to her hearing on December 18, 2007, at which the respondent requested voluntary departure. See Attachment to Motion to Reopen. Also, at her hearing, the respondent’s then-attorney clearly requested voluntary departure. Although the record is unclear as to whether the Immigration Judge was accurate in indicating that the respondent’s former counsel consulted with her about the voluntary departure request during the hearing (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 9-12), the fact remains that the respondent has not contended that her former counsel rendered ineffective assistance; nor has she complied with the legal requirements for such a contention. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board to apply the Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
Moreover, the respondent’s former attorney was previously given a seven-month continuance to prepare the respondent’s case (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 1-2). Despite this continuance, the only relief that the respondent’s former attorney requested at her subsequent hearing was a period of voluntary departure “to the maximum extent the Court can grant her” (Tr. at 9). The Immigration Judge did require the respondent to waive all appeal rights as a condition to receiving the maximum 120-day period for voluntary departure, but such a requirement exists as a matter of law. See Matter of Ocampo-Ugalde, 22 I&N Dec. 1301 (BIA 2000). Further, although the respondent’s former counsel initially contested the legal validity of the Notice to Appear, he (and thus the respondent) ultimately abandoned his challenges when — after the Immigration Judge accepted an amendment to the Notice to Appear but otherwise ruled against the legal challenges — counsel conceded removability and waived appeal in order to receive the maximum voluntary departure period. Given these facts, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
*2 Finally, we note that all motions to reopen based on an application for relief “must be accompanied by the appropriate application.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Here, despite requesting reopening, the respondent does not allege that she is eligible for any relief from removal. See Respondent’s Brief at 2; Notice of Appeal. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated that she suffered prejudice from the Immigration Judge’s alleged error. See Eke v. Mukasey, 512 F.3d 372, 383 (7th Cir. 2008). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Daniel Redwood
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
On January 28, 2010, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider the Board’s January 8, 2010, decision finding him removable as charged. He filed a second motion to reconsider on February 4, 2010, and filed a motion to reopen on March 8, 2010. The respondent also submitted an opposition to one of the Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) submissions which we construe as a second motion to reopen, filed March 19, 2010. The record will be remanded.
 
In his various motions the respondent argues that his conviction for indecent behavior with a juvenile in violation of Louisiana Revised Statutes § 14:81 was not an aggravated felony. He argues that the statute is divisible, and it is unclear under what section of the statute he was convicted. As such, he maintains that the record cannot support a finding that he was convicted of an aggravated felony. The respondent also essentially contends that his former attorney provided him with ineffective assistance by erroneously advising him that his noted conviction constituted an aggravated felony, and in advising him to concede removability. In addition, he avers that he is not subject to removal as he is a national of the United States.
 
We initially find no merit to the respondent’s argument that he is a national of the United States because he served in the United States military, at which time he pledged an oath of allegiance to the United States (3/8/10 Motion at 1). Contrary to the respondent’s arguments otherwise, service in the armed forces of the United States and the taking of the standard military oath does not make a person a national of this country. See Warmington v. Keisler, 254 Fed. Appx. 287, 289 (5th Cir. 2007), citing Reyes-Alcaraz v. Ashcroft, 363 F.3d 937, 938-40 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that service in the armed forces of the United States, along with the taking of the standard military oath, does not alter an alien’s status to that of a “national” within the meaning of the Act); see also Omolo v. Gonzales, 452 F.3d 404, 409 (5th Cir. 2006) (finding that “a person may become a national only by birth or by completing the naturalization process”).
 
With the respondent’s February 4, 2010, motion he submitted evidence that he sent a letter to former counsel advising her of his intent to pursue a claim of ineffective assistance against her.¿FN1º In his March 19, 2010, response to a DHS submission, the respondent reported that he had complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, appending a copy of an affidavit from himself, and a bar complaint he reportedly filed against former counsel. As with another submission, these submissions and associated arguments constitute a motion to reopen. Id.
 
*2 This Board is cognizant of the number limitations on motions to reconsider and reopen. Therefore, to resolve any ambiguity in this regard, we shall accept the entirety of the respondent’s submissions sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). We find that the respondent has substantially satisfied the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000). As a result of counsel’s concession to the charge of removability, the respondent was precluded from presenting any argument in this regard. Such action served to prejudice the respondent. See De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 884 (5th Cir. 2004) (requiring a showing of prejudice for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
In light of the record before us, and affording the respondent every benefit of the doubt, we find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. On remand, the respondent should be allowed an opportunity to contest the charge of removability. Therefore, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carmen A. Leal
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Remand; 212(c) waiver
 
This case was last before us on March 26, 2007, when we granted the respondent’s unopposed motion to reopen, and remanded the record to the Immigration Court for further proceedings. On June 3, 2008, the Immigration Judge issued a new decision denying the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (repealed 1996), and ordering the respondent removed to Pakistan. The respondent has now appealed this decision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has requested that the Immigration Judge’s decision be affirmed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met their relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii); see also Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent first argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in refusing new counsel’s request to amend the pleadings in remanded proceedings after the Board granted the respondent’s motion to reopen his case based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent further argues that his theft offense conviction under section 31.03 of the Texas Penal Code was divisible, and that the DHS did not meet its burden of establishing that the respondent was convicted of the portion of the statute which qualified his offense as an aggravated felony.
 
We initially note that the respondent on appeal has mischaracterized the Board’s March 26, 2007, decision granting his unopposed motion to reopen. Contrary to the respondent’s assertions, the Board made no explicit or implicit “determination that previous counsel was ineffective,” and further, that it should then be “assume¿dº that any pleading taken during previous proceedings was without the advice of effective counsel at that time” (see Respondent’s Br. at 3, 9). There was nothing in the Board’s March 26, 2007, decision which required the Immigration Judge to allow him to change his pleadings simply because new counsel would “like to deny some of the allegations” (Tr. at 3-11). See, e.g., Hoodho v. Holder, 558 F.3d 184, 187 (2d Cir. 2009) (“A petitioner cannot disavow that concession because, in hindsight, it might have been preferable for him to have contested removability, rather than to have conceded it.”).
 
*2 The respondent did not clearly articulate an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as it related to his pleadings in his motion to the Board (his motion alleges only ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to file a 212(c) waiver application) or before the Immigration Judge at his remanded proceedings (Tr. at 3-11; see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen). The respondent’s arguments regarding the alleged error in prior counsel’s concessions he now raises on appeal were not brought before the Immigration Judge, and we further note that the respondent has not filed an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as it relates to counsel’s judicial admissions under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The distinct and formal concession of removability, made by the respondent’s attorney acting in his professional capacity and in the respondent’s presence during the removal hearing, is binding on the respondent as a judicial admission. The respondent in the instant case has not established that circumstances exist that would permit the withdrawal of his prior judicial admissions. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made as a tactical decision by an attorney in a deportation proceeding is binding on his alien client); cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(B) (authorizing summary dismissal of appeals when “¿tºhe only reason for the appeal specified by the party concerned involves a finding of fact or a conclusion of law that was conceded by that party at a prior proceeding”); see generally Pool Co. v. Cooper, 274 F.3d 173, 185 (5th Cir. 2001) (finding that the court was entitled to treat a concession as a binding judicial admission of fact.); Martinez v. Bally’s Louisiana, Inc., 244 F.3d 474 (5th Cir 2001) (a judicial admission is conclusive, unless the court allows it to be withdrawn). Accordingly, we will dismiss the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s determination that he is removable as charged on the Notice to Appear (NTA).
 
Moreover, even if we were to consider arguendo the respondent’s contentions on appeal challenging his removability, we find his arguments to be unavailing. The record includes undisputed evidence showing that the respondent was convicted of tampering with government records in the third degree in 1989, and of theft in the third degree in 1992, in violation of Texas law (Gr. Exh. 6A). We note that the respondent on appeal has not challenged his deportability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, and he thus remains removable under this charge.
 
With regard to the charge of removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, the respondent has argued that section 31.03 of the Texas Penal Code, the statute under which he was convicted, is a divisible statute. Specifically, he has argued that the statute does not “necessarily” require “an intent to deprive the owner of his property” (Respondent’s Br. at 8-9). This assertion, however, is contravened by a plain reading of section 31.03 of the Texas Penal Code, which provides, in relevant part, that a person commits a theft offense “if he unlawfully appropriates property with intent to deprive the owner of property.” Section 31.03(a) of the Texas Penal Code (emphasis added). Accordingly, “intent to deprive the owner of property” is an essential element of theft under Texas law. Moreover, even if the respondent was convicted under a divisible statute, his record of conviction establishes that his conviction was an aggravated felony as described in section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act¿FN1º under the modified categorical approach.
 
*3 The record of conviction shows that the respondent in 1992 entered a plea of nolo contendre to “¿tºheft (sting operation), with intent to deprive the owner,” and the indictment charged the respondent, “with intent to deprive the owner…of the property…¿to wit: 90 carton of cigarettesº and believing said property was stolen by another, appropriate, by acquiring and otherwise exercising control over said property” (Exh. 6A). The respondent was sentenced to 2 years of imprisonment for this crime (id.). In Matter of Cardiel-Guerrero, 25 I&N Dec. 12 (BIA 2009) and Matter of Bahta, 22 I&N Dec. 1381 (BIA 2000), the Board held that the generic and contemporary meaning of “receipt of stolen property” described in section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act prohibits the concealing, selling, or withholding of stolen or extorted property, or aiding in same, knowing it to have been so stolen or obtained. The Texas theft offense for which the respondent was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding 1 year, falls within the generic definition of “receipt of stolen property” relied upon by the Board in its precedent decisions, and constitutes an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act. Accordingly, the respondent also remains removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.
 
Turning to the respondent’s application for relief from removal, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent cannot obtain a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act because there is no comparable ground of inadmissibility to section 101(a)(43(G) of the Act, the category that underpins his aggravated felony charge under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act. See Matter of Brieva-Perez, 23 I&N Dec. 766, 771 (BIA 2005), pet’n for review denied by Brieva v. Gonzales, 482 F.3d 356 (5th Cir. 2007); Matter of Blake, 23 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 2005); see also 8 C.F.R. 1212.3(f)(5). The test for determining whether a ground of removability has a statutory counterpart in section 212(a) of the Act “turns on whether Congress has employed similar language to describe substantially equivalent categories of offenses.” Matter of Brieva-Perez, supra, at 771, citing Matter of Blake, supra. No provision in section 212(a) of the Act establishes inadmissibility for theft or “receipt of stolen property” or any comparable category of offenses. We recognize that a theft offense is ordinarily a crime involving moral turpitude and thus a conviction therefor will render an alien inadmissible under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act. Nonetheless, that fact does not establish comparability under the standard announced in Matter of Brieva-Perez, supra, and Matter of Blake, supra. The wide range of offenses that fall within the scope of section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act simply does not compare in any way that can be described as substantially equivalent to the narrow category of theft offenses specified in section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act. Cf. Matter of Brieva, 23 I&N Dec. 766 (BIA 2005) (holding that section 212(a) of the Act does not contain a ground of inadmissibility that corresponds to the crime or violence ground of removability). Thus, we conclude that section 212(a) of the Act does not contain a ground of inadmissibility that is comparable to the grounds upon which the respondent is removable. Accordingly, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to pretermit the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c).
 
*4 Finally, the respondent claims that the Immigration Judge erred in “fail¿ingº to consider other forms of relief respondent may assert to avoid removal,” and that he intends to apply for benefits under section 244 of the Act, as the spouse of a temporary protected status beneficiary (Respondent’s Br. at 14). We note, however, that the respondent was asked by the Immigration Judge what relief from removal he wanted to pursue, and he never stated he had any intention to file an application for benefits under section 244 of the Act (Tr. at 11-12, 30). The respondent on appeal has not otherwise submitted an application for relief from removal, or presented new evidence establishing his prima facie eligibility for derivative temporary protected status¿FN2º or any other relief from removal that may have justified remanding his case for further proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 14). See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992) (a motion to remand may be denied where a prima facie case for the relief sought has not been established, or in the absence of previously unavailable, material evidence).
 
In view of the foregoing, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robin Chandler Carr, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
J.L. Woodmansee
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 We entered the final administrative order in this case on March 29, 2006, and denied a subsequent motion to reopen in 2007. On October 8, 2009, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorney who represented him at his initial hearings before the Immigration Judge. Alternatively, the respondent requests that we reconsider his case in light of the decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in de Rodriquez -Echeverria v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 1047 (9th Cir. 2008). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s excuse for failing to comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (requiring a showing of prejudice in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel). Although prior counsel no longer practiced at the location where his office was previously located, the respondent has not explained what reasonable steps were taken to determine if he was still practicing law, and where.
 
In any event, the respondent has not shown that he exercised due diligence in pursuing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against Robert B. Schneider, Esquire. Although it is not specifically referenced in the motion, the respondent’s current counsel, Ms. Carr, represented the respondent at his final hearing before the Immigration Judge in 2005, on appeal to the Board (when she received a full copy of the transcript), and on his first motion to reopen in 2007. If the respondent felt that Mr. Schneider’s strategy and efforts at the initial hearings in the immigration court constituted ineffective assistance, such a claim could have been pursued years ago. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003)(holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). See also Ghahremani v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 993 (9th Cir. 2007)(a demonstration of “unbroken efforts to retain competent counsel and file a motion to reopen” is necessary to establish due diligence warranting equitable tolling). Accordingly, the motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel will be denied as untimely and number-barred.
 
*2 The respondent’s alternative argument also fails. De Rodriquez - Echeverria v. Mukasey, supra, does not represent a fundamental change in law. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999) (emphasizing the importance of administrative finality and finding that the Board will exercise sua sponte authority to reconsider a case under new law only when the change in law is fundamental in nature and not merely an incremental development in the state of the law). In De Rodriquez -Echeverria the court remanded the case to us to address, in the first instance, whether 8 C.F.R. § 287.3(c) was violated and the statements were voluntary in the circumstances of that case. Further, as the DHS points out in its opposition brief, the respondent has not addressed the Ninth Circuit’s subsequent decision in Samayoa-Martinez v. Holder, 558 F.3d 897, 901-02 (9th Cir. 2009), which was issued seven months before this motion was filed. In Samayoa-Martinez the court held that 8 C.F.R.§ 287.3(c) does not require that DHS advise an alien of a right to counsel until the alien is placed in formal proceedings by the filing of the Notice to Appeal in the immigration court. The court also noted that § 287.3(c) does not include any requirement that the alien be advised of a right to remain silent or a right against self-incrimination.¿FN1º Id. at n. 6. Accordingly, the respondent has not demonstrated a fundamental change in law that impacts the result in this case and the motion to reconsider based on De Rodriquez-Echeverria v. Mukasey, supra, will also be denied as untimely.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose M. Guerrero, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jane H. Thomson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of South Africa, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s August 7, 2008, denial of her motion to reopen her deportation proceedings. During those proceedings, she was granted voluntary departure. The respondent withdrew her request for voluntary departure and requested reopening to pursue her pending application for adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility made by the Immigration Judge, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2009). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008).
 
In her motion to reopen, the respondent claimed that her prior counsel was ineffective in that he did not pursue the respondent’s pending application for adjustment of status as a stepchild of a United States citizen. The Immigration Judge found that the motion was untimely. He further concluded that the appellant had not complied with the requirements for claiming ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
On appeal, the respondent makes no argument concerning the untimeliness of her motion to reopen, and we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the motion to reopen was not timely filed by the respondent’s current attorney. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2)(motions to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of final administrative removal order).
 
We further agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. Specifically, she did not submit an affidavit from the respondent setting forth in detail the allegations against her former counsel, and she did not demonstrate that her former attorney had been informed of the allegations and had an opportunity to respond (I.J. at 3). Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639; see also Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497 (5th Cir. 2000) (upholding the general application of the Lozada rules). The fact that the respondent submitted a copy of the complaint against her former attorney is not sufficient (Respondent’s Br. at 2). First, the respondent submitted no proof of filing with, or receipt by, the State Bar of Texas. Second, the respondent’s statement in the complaint does not serve as an affidavit. Third, the respondent has submitted nothing to demonstrate that her former attorney received a copy of the complaint or any other information concerning her claim of ineffective assistance. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.¿FN1º
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

While we need not address whether the respondent has demonstrated sufficient prejudice in her claim of prior ineffective assistance, we note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has ruled that the failure to receive relief that is purely discretionary in nature does not amount to a deprivation of a constitutional liberty interest. Assaad v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 471, 475-76 (5th Cir. 2004).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Vanessa G. Pocock
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on September 17, 2009, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal alleging that the voluntary departure bond set by the Immigration Judge was excessive and found that the respondent’s due process rights had not been violated by the Immigration Judge’s denial of a motion to withdraw as counsel filed by his attorney. The respondent, a male native and citizen of Mexico, has filed a timely motion to reopen for consideration of cancellation of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reopen proceedings shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material and shall not be granted unless it appears that the evidence offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the alien establishes a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). The respondent also claims that reopening is warranted because he received ineffective assistance from his former attorney which resulted in the failure to file an application for cancellation of removal below.
 
The respondent acknowledges that he could have filed a cancellation application with supporting evidence for consideration at the 2008 hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). While the respondent has submitted an application for cancellation in support of this motion, he has not provided an affidavit or any other documentary evidence demonstrating prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal as required for reopening. See INS v. Abudu, supra. We further note that the respondent has complied with none of the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498, 501-02 (7th Cir. 2001).¿FN1º Under the circumstances, the respondent has not shown that reopening is warranted.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent was represented below and on appeal by Malcolm B. Gerber, Esquire. The respondent addressed an unsworn statement, dated October 16, 2009, to Calmec Global Law Group generally stating that he was never given an opportunity to present an application for relief from removal for adjudication. This statement is inadequate to satisfy the Lozada requirement that the respondent notify Mr. Gerber of the charges of ineffective assistance raised and to provide Mr. Gerber with the opportunity to respond. In addition, although the respondent has provided a copy of an document signed by both the respondent and Mr. Gerber, this document is primarily in Spanish and is inadequate to set forth the nature and scope of their agreement, as it is not accompanied by an English translation. The respondent has also completed a copy of a form requesting investigation of the Calmec Global Group rather than Mr. Gerber, and there is no showing that the form has been filed with the Illinois bar.

IN RE: ROLAND SHABAN LLULLA
File: AXXX XX1 344 - Dallas, TX
March 26, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mark E. Jacobs, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated December 7, 2008, denying his motion to reopen to allow him to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The appeal will be sustained.
 
In a decision dated August 5, 2008, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had abandoned his application for cancellation of removal (Form EOIR 42B) due to his failure to file such application on or before the April 7, 2008, deadline set by the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 74). The respondent was ordered removed to Albania.
 
The respondent timely filed a motion to reopen demonstrating that the application and fee had been received by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) on January 28, 2008, and asserting that he believed his former attorney had filed the application with the Immigration Court. Although he had “fired” his attorney in late January 2008, he asserts that he believed his former attorney had done all that was necessary as far as filing his application with the Immigration Court. The respondent states that he was unaware of his former counsel’s filing of a motion to withdraw, which alleges that the respondent was informed of his obligation to file the Form EOIR-42B. He states that he only learned in June 2008 that his cancellation application had not been filed with the Immigration Court after he received his file from his former attorney, and he points out that he requested additional time to file said application in a motion filed with the Immigration Court on August 1, 2008.
 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposed reopening, and the Immigration Judge determined that reopening was not warranted. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had not complied with any of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Additionally, the respondent’s notarized verification stating that “on his oath … each and every statement contained ¿in the motion to reopenº is within my personal knowledge and is true and correct” was legally insufficient to prove any of the facts asserted in the motion.
 
The regulations provide that the Immigration Judge may set and extend time limits for the filing of applications and that an application shall be deemed waived if not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). In the instant case, the respondent admittedly missed the April 7, 2008, deadline set by the Immigration Judge for filing a Form EOIR-42B with the court.
 
*2 However, the facts set forth in the respondent’s motion, the truth of which he affirmed in a sworn statement, as well as errors contained in the former attorney’s motion to withdraw cast doubt on whether the respondent’s duty to file the EOIR-42B with the court was effectively communicated to him following his attorney’s withdrawal. The respondent’s former attorney indicated in his motion that such motion was delivered to the respondent. However, as pointed out by the respondent, the motion to withdraw identifies as his last known address an address in New Jersey, to which he had indicated in his motion to change venue he intended to move, rather than his address of record in Arlington, Texas.
 
Additionally, the motion lists an incorrect deadline for the filing of the Form EOIR-42B. See Immigration Court Practice Manual § 2.3(i)(ii)(attorney seeking withdrawal must provide evidence that he or she notified or attempted to notify the alien, with a recitation of specific efforts made, of pending deadlines, the necessity of meeting deadlines, and the consequences of failing to meet deadlines). Nor does it appear that a copy of the Immigration Judge’s order granting the motion to withdraw was sent to the respondent. Although the respondent, who attributes the failure to timely file to “miscommunication” rather than former counsel’s “ineffectiveness,” should have at least complied with the Lozada requirement of informing his former counsel of the allegations made against him, the errors contained in the motion to withdraw cast doubt on whether the respondent was informed by former counsel that he was expected to file the application with the court.
 
Additionally, it is apparent that the respondent did not intend to abandon his application, as the application and fee had already been sent to USCIS, and the respondent filed a motion several weeks before the scheduled hearing explaining the failure to timely file the application and requesting additional time to do so. The respondent has been in the United States for 17 years and has close family ties here. Under the circumstances, we find that proceedings should be reopened to give the respondent an opportunity to seek cancellation of removal. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ted Y. Yamada
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), will be denied.¿FN1º
 
An Immigration Judge on December 17, 2003, denied the respondent’s motion to terminate and found the respondent subject to removal based on alien smuggling. The Board affirmed this decision without opinion on March 14, 2005. The respondent, who is from Mexico, filed a motion to reopen on January 28, 2010. The motion was filed many years out of time. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent broadly claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, but neither explains specifically how counsel failed him, nor complies with the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Additionally, reopening under the Board’s discretionary sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(a) is reserved for exceptional situations, which have not been demonstrated here. Matter of, J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); DHS Opp. The motion is, therefore, denied as untimely.

The respondent has been removed from the United States to Mexico. In Coyt v. Holder, 593 F.3d 902 (9th Cir. 2010), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Board may not find a motion withdrawn by operation of law, when the respondent is removed prior to the Board’s ruling on the motion. The motion is not, therefore, barred by reason of the respondent’s removal.

File: AXXX XX5 017 - New York, NY

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Daniel W. Diaz, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 25, 2008. Based on admissions of the allegations of fact and concession of the charge of removability made in the Notice to Appear, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable for being present in the United States without admission or parole. The respondent requested no relief from removal. The respondent, through present counsel, requested an order of removal with the intention of requesting deferred action from the Department of Homeland Security. Consequently, the Immigration Judge entered an order of removal.
 
On appeal, the respondent’s present counsel argues that the respondent’s previous accredited representative made the admissions of allegations and concession of removability without the respondent’s authority. He also claims that the accredited representative misled counsel concerning whether pleadings had been taken. He alleges that this “foreclosed the respondent’s established legal strategy.”
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On review of the record, we find that the respondent was represented by an accredited representative after venue was changed to New York. Pleadings had not been taken prior to the change of venue. At the first hearing in New York, the accredited representative requested to have pleadings put over to prepare a suppression motion. The Immigration Judge granted the requested continuance. See Tr. at 18-23. At the next hearing, the accredited representative said he intended to request a deferred action in light of the fact that the respondent is suffering from end stage renal failure. At that hearing, the accredited representative admitted the factual allegations and conceded removability. The respondent was present at that hearing and at no time expressed any objection to either the planned request for deferred action or the admissions and concession made on his behalf. See Tr. at 25-27.
 
At the next hearing, substitute counsel Diaz appeared. He told the Immigration Judge that the respondent intended to take an order of removal and then request a deferred action. He said that no voluntary departure was requested but did request additional time before the entry of the order to enable him to prepare the packet of medical records needed for the deferred action request. That request was granted. See Tr. at 29. At the final hearing, counsel presented a suppression motion that was denied. See Tr. at 34. Counsel then requested the removal order be entered. See Tr. at 35.
 
*2 Present counsel is in effect alleging that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel from the prior accredited representative. However, the prerequisites for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel have not been fulfilled. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Moreover, the respondent has failed to identify how the admissions and concession negatively affected the outcome of the respondent’s case. The claimant must establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his accredited representative’s ineffectiveness. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, supra. This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Jiang v. Mukasey, 522 F.3d 266, 270 (2d Cir. 2008); Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
While present counsel says that the admissions of the allegations and concession of removability “foreclosed the respondent’s established legal strategy,” both present counsel and the former accredited representative indicated repeatedly that the legal strategy was to take an order of removal and request a deferred action. At the first hearing where he made an appearance, present counsel did not mention a suppression motion or ask whether pleadings had been taken. See Tr. at 29-31. We find that the prior accredited representative’s decision to admit the allegations or concede removability was a reasonable tactical decision and find no evidence in the record of egregious circumstance requiring the setting aside of the pleadings. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). In light of the fact that the respondent had no apparent relief from removal, and in light of the fact that the respondent is suffering from end stage renal failure, it was a reasonable tactical decision to request a removal order with the intention of requesting a deferred action. Consequently, the respondent has failed to show a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jorge De La Mar, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 This case has been before the Board on two prior occasions; April 27, 2009, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen in absentia proceedings, and July 30, 2009, when we denied her motion to reconsider our prior decision. On August 17, 2009, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen proceedings. The motion is denied.
 
With her motion the respondent has submitted a two-sentence statement from her counsel swearing that he “did not receive proper service of the next scheduled hearing date.” It appears from the record that this document was produced in response to an observation in our prior decision that such a statement was not of record. The motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 90-days after the Board’s April 2009 decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent also has not demonstrated that this statement was previously unavailable, and could not have been presented in conjunction with her original motion to reopen. We observe that the respondent has neither alleged that she had ineffective assistance of counsel in this regard, nor complied with any of the requirements for such a claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Given this record, we decline to exercise our discretionary authority to sua sponte reopen and remand proceedings for consideration of counsel’s statement. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(a), (c). We do not find that the piecemeal presentation of evidence in response to noted deficiencies in proof supports reopening of the proceedings. In addition, this document fails to overcome the fact, as noted in our prior decision, that the Immigration Judge’s decision reopening proceedings and the notice of hearing were not returned as undeliverable by the Postal Service. Therefore, we find that reopening is not warranted. Id.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Karla S. Baker
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on March 22, 2005, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings following an in absentia order of removal dated April 14, 2004. On July 28, 2009, the respondent flied a motion to reopen proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
With certain exceptions, an alien is entitled to file only one motion to reopen and the motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order of removal. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s current motion is a second motion to reopen and it was flied with the Board more than 5 years after the final administrative order of removal was entered.
 
The record establishes that neither the respondent, nor his counsel appeared at the respondent’s April 14, 2004, hearing. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia. A motion to reopen and a Notice of Appearance (Form EOIR-28) was filed with the Immigration Judge on June 16, 2004, by Attorney Patrick Tachie-Menson. The motion claimed that the respondent was ill on the day of the hearing, that he had terminated services with his prior attorney and had not yet retained Attorney Tachie-Menson, and that he did not know how to notify the Immigration Court about his illness. Attached to the motion was letter from a doctor dated May 18, 2004. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, and this Board affirmed that decision on March 22, 2005.
 
The respondent’s current motion to reopen was filed more than 4 years later. The respondent now claims that he had retained the services of an attorney, Lloyd Ukwu¿FN1º prior to his hearing, that Mr. Ukwu knew about the respondent’s back problems and said he would appear in Immigration Court on behalf of the respondent, that the attorney did not appear, and that the respondent only discovered this fact after he had been ordered removed in absentia. The respondent states that he received a document from the Immigration Court, took it to Mr. Ukwu for explanation, and was told he had been ordered deported and would have to file a motion to reopen. The respondent states that he was later visited by Mr. Ukwu and Mr. Tachie-Menson, and that he was told to write a letter, based on what was dictated to him, and to sign it. The respondent reports that on June 11, 2004, Mr. Ukwu contacted him again about an urgent need to come to his office, pick up a letter, and have it notarized. The respondent states that he did what he was told, even though he knew it was not in his best interest.
 
*2 The respondent reports that after the June 11, 2004, incident he never again heard from Mr. Ukwu. The respondent states that he called the attorney’s office and also visited there, but was told Mr. Ukwu was out of the country. Later, the respondent’s work permit expired and he sought advice from other attorneys. Based on this advise, the respondent filed a complaint against Mr. Ukwu with the District of Columbia Bar on February 22, 2007. On April 30, 2009, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, but it was rejected due to lack of jurisdiction. On July 28, 2009, the respondent filed the motion that is before us now. In his motion he claims that Mr. Ukwu provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent’s motion was filed many years after the final administrative order of removal and is untimely. Further, the respondent does not benefit from equitable tolling because he has not demonstrated, or even alleged, that he exercised due diligence in seeking reopening. See Chao v. Virginia Department of Transportation, 291 F.3d 276, 283 (4th Cir. 2002) (equitable tolling is not available when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf). The respondent was ordered removed on April 14, 2004. He last heard from Mr. Ukwu, the person he claims provided the ineffective assistance, in June 2004. He states that he knew that the documents filed with the Immigration Judge in June 2004, were not in his interest. He did not attempt to seek reopening until 2009. Notably, the respondent filed his complaint with the District of Columbia Bar at the beginning of 2007, more than 2 years before his motion to reopen was filed with the Board. The respondent provides no explanation for the significant delay. Thus, due diligence has not been established in this case, and equitable tolling does not apply.
 
Additionally, we agree with the DHS that the respondent has failed to submit a statement addressing the scope of his agreement with Mr. Ukwu, a requirement for ineffective assistance claims. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. He has also not made any ineffective assistance allegations against the attorney who was actually his attorney of record in the Immigration Court, Mr. Tachie-Menson. The respondent has not supported his motion with a signed or sworn statement, as required by Lozada, and he has also admitted to signing a statement, attached to his original motion, that contained false allegations.
 
For these reasons, the respondent’s untimely filed motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: ROSA MARY ABREU-PAEZ
File: AXXX XX9 019 - New York, NY
March 12, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jose Alexis Rojas, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening, reconsideration
 
On April 25, 2008, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen her proceedings. And on May 16, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider the denial of the motion to reopen. The respondent has appealed from both decisions. The appeal will be dismissed.
  
I. BACKGROUND
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic. On appeal, she argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not reopening her proceeding. She claims that she has shown that she is eligible to adjust her status on the basis of a visa petition filed by her United States citizen husband and that she is prima facie eligible for adjustment under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i).
 
In addition, the respondent maintains that her failure to departure voluntarily or to file a timely motion was not willful. She argues that she did not depart because the extension of section 245(i) of the Act made her eligible for relief. And she claims that she did not file a timely motion to reopen because she was waiting for her priority date to become current or for her husband to become a United States citizen.
 
Finally, the respondent appears to allege that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. And she claims that she should not be prejudiced by her former attorneys’ failure to file motions to reopen.
  
II. ANALYSIS
 
As the Immigration Judge correctly noted, the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). And the respondent has not established that she is entitled to one of the exceptions to the time limits on motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4).
 
In addition, the respondent has not established that she is prima facie eligible for the relief she is seeking, despite her claims. See, e.g., Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996) (discussing proof required for reopening to seek newly available relief). The respondent is statutorily barred from obtaining adjustment of status for another year because she failed to depart voluntarily as required on or before February 5, 2001. See section 240B(d)(1)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d)(1)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(a). The respondent therefore is not entitled to reopening to pursue adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act even if she meets the other requirements for adjustment.
 
*2 The respondent claims on appeal that her failure to depart or to file a timely motion was not willful, but she has not established that her failure to depart was involuntary. Cf. Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87, 93-94 (BIA 2007).¿FN1º And there is no “exceptional circumstances” exception to section 240B(d)(1)(B) of the Act. Id. Moreover, the record shows that the respondent received the proper advisals regarding the consequences of failing to depart voluntarily. See Immigration Judge’s Decision dated October 6, 2000.
 
Finally, while the respondent appears to allege that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Immigration Judge correctly noted that the respondent has not met the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We therefore cannot conclude that the respondent is entitled to any remedy due to the possible conduct or misconduct of one of her attorneys. See Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Garcia-Martinez v. Department of Homeland Security, 448 F.3d 511, 513-14 (2d Cir. 2006) (indicating that an alien who fails to comply substantially with the Lozada requirements forfeits his or her ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
Based on the foregoing, we find that the Immigration Judge acted properly in denying both the respondent’s motion to reopen and her motion to reconsider the denial of her motion to reopen. We therefore uphold the Immigration Judge’s decisions and we dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent’s justification for filing her motion many years after the date upon which she was required to depart voluntarily also is not sufficient to justify sua sponte reopening. See, e.g., Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (indicating that sua sponte reopening is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or to circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sean Lewis, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William A. Lund
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On August 28, 2009, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen these proceedings based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent asserts that his prior attorneys failed to inform him that he could file a motion to reopen these proceedings once his immediate relative visa petition was approved by the DHS’s United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. The respondent explains that he would have sought reopening to apply for voluntary departure, and would have voluntarily departed and applied for an immigrant visa in Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes reopening. The motion will be denied.
 
First, the respondent has not met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We do not find the respondent’s explanation for failing to comply with these requirements to be adequate. Further, the respondent has neither demonstrated that prior counsels’ representation was ineffective or that prejudice resulted from his former counsels’ performance. Id. The respondent is ineligible for adjustment of status under section 245(a) because he was not inspected and admitted into the United States, and he does not assert or establish that he is eligible for adjustment under section 245(i). Moreover, the respondent is ineligible for voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), because he was not physically present in the United States for a 1-year period immediately preceding the date the Notice to Appear was served (I.J. at 3; Exh. 1). Thus, the respondent has failed to establish that his prior attorneys’ conduct prejudiced his case. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ivan Crnilovic, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a female native and citizen of the Dominican Republic who has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision mailed on January 8, 2009. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia on March 4, 2008. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
Upon de novo review we find that the respondent has not established that proceedings should be reopened. The respondent claims in her motion to reopen that she and her former attorney of record, Paul A. Farina, Esquire, believed the hearing date was scheduled for March 18, 2008. The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent received proper notice since she and Mr. Farina attended a hearing on October 9, 2007, when Mr. Farina was provided with personal service of the hearing notice listing the correct date and time of the hearing. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (providing that whenever a person is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to the attorney or representative of record, or to the person himself if unrepresented). The respondent does not contest the Immigration Judge’s determination regarding a lack of notice, therefore this issue is waived.
 
We turn now to the respondent’s argument raised for the first time on appeal that her former attorney was ineffective for providing the respondent with the wrong hearing date. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and if the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). See also Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A. G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”).
 
*2 The respondent has submitted a new affidavit on appeal stating that Mr. Farina told her the wrong hearing date. However, the respondent does not state that she informed Mr. Farina of the ineffective assistance claim that she has filed with the Board. Prior counsel has therefore been deprived of an opportunity to respond to the complaint before us. Thus, the Board is unable to consider the position of prior counsel to the allegations filed against him. Moreover, the respondent has failed to detail the agreement that was entered into with Mr. Farina with respect to the actions to be taken in this case and she does not state whether she has sought to file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities and if not, why not. We therefore find that the respondent has failed to establish exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear since she has failed to comply with Lozada. See Beltre-Veloz v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 2008) (finding that an alien’s affidavit that “makes no mention of the nature, scope, or substance of the ¿ alien’sº arrangement with ¿his attorneyº, ¿and fails toº indicate what communications the ¿alienº had with the attorney” contains a“fatal flaw” under the Lozada requirements).
 
The respondent also contends on appeal that her motion warrants reopening as a matter of discretion because she may qualify for cancellation of removal based upon her three United States citizen children or as a battered spouse. See section 240A(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). Attached to the respondent’s brief on appeal, she submitted documentation apparently related to a battered spouse claim. See 240A(b)(2)(A) of the Act. To the extent that the respondent seeks reopening and remand based upon this evidence, her speculation that she may seek relief does not warrant reopening sua sponte, nor does it support a remand to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of this issue. We therefore find no reason to disturb the decision of the Immigration Judge.
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Shahla Khan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on January 16, 2007. On February 21, 2008, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s denial of a motion he filed seeking reopening of that decision. Therein we found the respondent had failed to overcome the presumption of proper delivery of his hearing notice, and did not demonstrate that reopening was appropriate. On July 29, 2009, the respondent submitted a second motion to reopen, now alleging that he received ineffective assistance from two former representatives, and asking that proceedings be reopened. The motion will be denied.
 
We initially observe that to the extent that the respondent avers that this Board erred in our prior decision with respect to the admission and consideration of a letter from Victor Salazar, these arguments are in the nature of a motion to reconsider (Motion at 5). See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). As it was filed more than 30 days after the Board’s decision, it is untimely, and we shall consider this aspect of his motion no further. Section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b).
 
The respondent now alleges that two persons whom he reportedly retained in the course of his proceedings provided him with ineffective assistance such that reopening is warranted. Specifically, he avers that following his release from DHS detention he met with and hired Victor Salazar of the Jackson Height Rafaelli Law Offices (Motion at 3-4). He states that Mr. Salazar falsely held himself out as an attorney, and advised the respondent to not attend his scheduled hearing as he would otherwise be deported from the United States, and did not inform him of the consequences of such action. He further contends that after he learned in April of 2007 of the removal order resulting from his failure to appear, he retained Jonathan Saint-Preux, Esquire, to file a motion to reopen, claiming that he failed to appear at his heating due to exceptional circumstances.¿FN1º However, he claims that Mr. Saint-Preux did not investigate the facts regarding a letter from Mr. Salazar which related to his claim of lack of knowledge of his hearing date or of Mr. Salazar’s direction that he not appear at his hearing, nor did he raise a claim of ineffective assistance against Mr. Salazar (Motion at 4). After Mr. Saint-Preux was suspended from practicing law, the respondent hired Cindy Paul, Esquire, to represent him on appeal before the Board, and subsequently hired current counsel to file a petition for review of the Board’s 2008 decision before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the petition was ultimately denied).
 
*2 In his motion the respondent also repeats his assertion that he never received personal service of his hearing notice (Motion at 3, 13 (ftnt. 7)). However, the Board previously considered this allegation and found no merit to the same. The respondent has raised no new factual allegations or legal arguments regarding the service of the hearing notice to the address he himself provided, and which he continues to assert was his address during the relevant time period. This issue has been fully litigated, including in a petition before the Second Circuit. Therefore, we decline to revisit these arguments, and shall address them no further.
 
The respondent essentially avers that Mr. Salazar falsely presented himself as an attorney and told him not to appear at his hearing as he would be deported, advising him to await the possibility of future relief. He also contends that Mr. Saint-Preux, whom he retained to reopen absentia proceedings, erred by not investigating the circumstances regarding a letter from the non-attorney sent to the Immigration Court, stating that the respondent could not be contacted, had relocated, and would not be appearing at his hearing. We recognize that the time and number bars on motions to reopen may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, so long as the movant has exercised “due diligence” in vindicating his rights. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 171 (2d Cir. 2006’).
 
We find that the respondent has not exercised due diligence in this regard. In conjunction with the 2007 motion to reopen filed by Mr. Saint-Preux, the respondent submitted a sworn affidavit which he signed under penalty of perjury. Therein the respondent stated that he was “unaware that ¿heº had a court ¿hearingº date” because his “previous attorney did not notify me that my presence was requested by the courts of Immigration.” These attestations are inconsistent with his new claim that he was, in fact, told of his hearing date by Mr. Salazar. He has not alleged that he informed Mr. Saint-Preux of Mr. Salazar’s purported actions, despite the fact that Mr. Salazar’s letter was submitted with the motion and referenced therein (2007 Motion at 2, attachment B). As such, we are not convinced that Mr. Saint-Preux committed cognizable error as alleged.¿FN2º
 
With the above-noted motion, the respondent also submitted a signed and sworn “Client Verification” stating that the attestations in the motion were true. Thus, by his own statements, the respondent was aware of the contents of his motion, and therefore knew that it failed to include any mention of the actions that he now alleges Mr. Salazar committed. Moreover, in our February 21, 2008, decision the Board noted that the respondent had failed to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against Mr. Salazar (Board Dec. at 2). Therefore, at the latest the respondent was aware of the deficiency in his motion as of that date. He has not averred that Ms. Paul, who was then representing him, did not inform him of the Board’s decision, and/or provide him with a copy of the same. Thus, as the respondent waitcd almost a year and a half to file the instant motion since he was, or should have been, aware of the failure of Mr. Saint-Preux and/or Ms. Paul to raise his new allegations of error against Mr. Salazar, he did not exercise due diligence in pursuing his claim, id.
 
*3 In closing, we observe that the errors alleged of Mr. Saint-Preux, of failing to thoroughly investigate the respondent’s relationship with Mr. Salazar and the issue of the noted letter, are equally true of Ms. Paul, yet no claim of ineffective assistance has been prosecuted against either of her. Similarly, although respondent’s present counsel, Ms. Khan, has been representing him since at least March 21, 2008, the instant motion was not filed until more than a year later, and only after the Second Circuit denied the respondent’s petition for review (Motion at 2). This, again, is reflective of a lack of due diligence on the respondent’s part, and serves to further undermine his argument for reopening.
 
In sum, the respondent’s motion is not exempt from the number bar on motions to reopen. Therefore, reopening is not warranted. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

In the April 16, 2007, motion the respondent claimed that he did not receive any notice from either the Immigration Court or Mr. Salazar of his scheduled hearing.

2

Moreover, the respondent has by his own account made no attempt to contact Mr. Saint-Preux and notify him of the allegations made against him. The fact that Mr. Saint-Preux is no longer authorized to practice law does not absolve the respondent of his responsibility to provide his former counsel of an opportunity to respond to his assertions of error. As such, the respondent has not complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to Mr. Saint-Preux as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637(BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1 st Cir. 1988).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
David N. Shomloo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margaret A. Rosenast
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case is before the Board on remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Pursuant to an unopposed motion to remand filed by the government, in its July 28, 2009, unpublished order, the court remanded the case to the Board. Both parties have filed briefs concerning the court’s remand order. Upon further consideration, the respondents’ appeal will again be dismissed.
 
On March 11, 1999, the respondents, who are from Mexico, requested voluntary departure after affirmatively indicating their desire not to pursue applications for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). They departed pursuant to the terms of the voluntary departure grant, but re-entered the United States, which ultimately resulted in the current proceedings. On April 20, 2007, the respondents filed a motion to reopen their prior removal proceedings on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. On June 14, 2007, an Immigration Judge denied that motion and determined that there were no grounds on which to terminate the current proceedings.
 
In its November 14, 2008, decision dismissing the respondents’ appeal, the Board found, citing Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, 24 I&N Dec. 646, 653, 660 (BIA 2008), that we lacked jurisdiction to grant reopening under our sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), due to the respondents’ departure from the United States.
 
The government’s remand motion states that “¿rºemand will allow the agency to articulate a clear conclusion as to whether it holds, under ¿Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, supraº that it lacks jurisdiction to review ¿the respondents’º request for sua sponte reopening.”
 
The Board in Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, supra, ruled that the departure bars in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) preclude an alien from invoking the jurisdiction of either the Immigration Court or the Board to consider a motion to reopen or sua sponte reopening. In Matter of Armendarez, supra, at 650-53, we respectfully declined to follow the decisions of the Ninth Circuit in Reynoso-Cisneros v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1001 (9th Cir. 2007), and Lin v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2007), which had ruled to the contrary in certain contexts. In so declining, we relied in part on the Supreme Court’s decision in Nat’l Cable & Telecomms. Ass’n v. Brand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967 (2005).
 
*2 The Board acknowledges that in Coyt v. Holder, __ F.3d __, 2010 WL 174254 (9th Cir. Jan. 20, 2010), the Ninth Circuit found that 8 C.F.R. §1003.2(d) is invalid as applied to a forcibly removed alien. The Board finds this case inapplicable to the respondents’ situation, as they were not forcibly removed, but departed under a voluntary departure order. Therefore, neither the Immigration Judge, nor the Board, has jurisdiction to grant reopening in the respondents’ case, despite the respondents’ contentions to the contrary. Respondents’ Br., at 23-24; DHS Br., at 2.
 
In its November 14, 2008, order, the Board stated that it would also “address the merits of the respondents’ appeal”, given that the Immigration Judge’s decision on reopening predated Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, supra. The government’s remand motion before the Ninth Circuit states that the Board is to “explain whether its finding that ¿the respondentsº did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel was meant to address ¿the respondents’º request for sua sponte reopening or their request for equitable tolling of the filing deadline in their motion to reopen.” However, neither the Immigration Judge, nor the Board, addressed or considered whether the motion to reopen had been untimely filed with the Immigration Judge, and, therefore, the Board’s decision was not meant to address on what basis an untimely motion could be considered. Rather, the Board addressed the merits of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim at length. The effect of the administrative decisions is that the Immigration Judge, and the Board, assumed arguendo that the motion should not be dismissed as untimely.
 
The Board’s November 14, 2008, decision thoroughly reviewed, and then rejected, the respondents’ claim that a series of deficiencies in legal assistance during their prior proceedings amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel such that reopening of their prior proceedings should be granted so that they could apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act. As part of that analysis, the Board stated that:
Based on the advice of an attorney whom the respondents consulted for 10 minutes, and who did not represent them, the respondents decided to pursue only pre-conclusion voluntary departure. Regardless of whether it was bad advice, the decision to follow that advice after a 10 minute consultation with an un-retained attorney was the respondents’.
 
(citations omitted).
 
The government’s remand motion before the Ninth Circuit states that the Board is to “re-examine and/or develop or more fully explain the reasoning for whether an alien may forfeit his or her ability to allege ineffective assistance against an attorney by choosing to rely on that attorney’s advice, without ever retaining the attorney.”
 
*3 In further explanation of the Board’s reasoning on this point, the Board finds, in the context of this case, that the respondents cannot claim that they received ineffective assistance of counsel from the un-retained attorney, where they met with the unnamed attorney for such a short period of time, and the specifics of what was discussed during this time were not set out by the respondents. See Respondents’ Mot., Lead Respondent’s Affidavit (“We finally went to one attorney who told us not to ask for cancellation of removal and to just ask for voluntary departure. We had only met with this attorney for about ten minutes. Because of his advice, at our next hearing before the judge we did not file for cancellation of removal and we asked the judge for voluntary departure”); DHS Br. at 9-10; Respondents’ Br. at 16 (claiming that the respondents consulted with attorney for 10 minutes and were given incomplete advice).
 
In any event, as the Board explained in its November 14, 2008, decision, and contrary to arguments in the respondents’ brief, at 19-22, the respondents “knowingly and voluntarily waived their right to apply for cancellation of removal… the Immigration Judge reviewed with the respondents their rights and possible sources of relief,” but the respondents chose to forego applications for cancellation of removal.
 
The Board has given further consideration to the respondents’ case, as set out in the government’s remand motion approved by the Ninth Circuit. The Board again finds that the appeal should be dismissed. The following order will therefore be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 On December 14, 2009, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal as untimely. The respondent submitted a timely motion to reconsider on December 28, 2009. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The pending motion does not cause the Board to reconsider its prior decision in this case. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006)(a motion to reconsider must allege a material factual or legal error, assert that the Board erred in affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision without opinion, or argue a change in law).
 
The respondent claims that his former attorney agreed to file an appeal but failed to do so. First, the respondent does not explain why the untimely appeal was submitted almost 3 months past the June 22, 2009, due date, other than to vaguely state that he “had no knowledge of the fraud committed for about two months.” Given the respondent’s lack of diligence, we will not consider this appeal under our sua sponte authority. Matter of Liadov, 23 I&N Dec. 990 (BIA 2006)(Board has authority to consider a late appeal by certification under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (c), under appropriate circumstances).
 
Moreover, contrary to his arguments, the respondent fails to show compliance with Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, including that counsel be notified of the charges against him. Additionally, the complaint submitted to the state bar makes no claim about counsel agreeing to submit an appeal with the Board. Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857, 863 (6th Cir. 2006).
 
To the extent that the respondent seeks reopening of the Immigration Judge’s decision finding him subject to removal, and his argument that he is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), we lack jurisdiction over such motion, as this Board never had jurisdiction over an appeal in this case. Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974). The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

The respondent is a native and citizen of India. On May 3, 2006, the Immigration Judge granted him the privilege of voluntary departure until September 3, 2006.¿FN1º The Immigration Judge denied a motion to reopen seeking adjustment of status on September 19, 2006. The Board affirmed this decision on May 3, 2007, agreeing with the Immigration Judge that the motion to reopen was untimely filed, and failed to meet the requirements for reopening under Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 20.02).
 
Over two years later, on July 27, 2009, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen with the Board. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The motion brings a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, blaming the attorneys who earlier represented him before the Immigration Judge, and Board, for his motion to reopen being denied.
 
Concerning untimely motions filed in immigration proceedings, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has stated that “attorney negligence is not, without more, a basis to toll a statute of limitations.” Munoz De Real v. Holder,__ F.3d__, 2010 455404 (7th Cir. Feb. 11, 2010). The Seventh Circuit also held in Johnson v. Gonzales, 478 F.3d 795, 799 (7th Cir. 2007) that “¿iºt is a rare occasion that we reverse a decision on the basis that a time limit should have been equitably tolled… it must be shown that the claimant could not have been expected to file earlier.” The respondent claiming equitable tolling of a filing deadline must show that he has acted with due diligence. Id.; Patel v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 1011, 1016 (7th Cir. 2006); Pervaiz v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 488,489-90 (7th Cir. 2005). The pending motion provides no reason why the motions period should be tolled.
 
Moreover, the respondent fails to show compliance with any of the requirements in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Ghaffar v. Mukasey, 551 F.3d 651,656 (7th Cir. 2008).
 
*2 Finally, reopening under the Board’s discretionary sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) is reserved for exceptional situations, which have not been demonstrated here. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 On November 30, 2009, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal as untimely. The respondent submitted a timely motion to reconsider on December 17, 2009. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The pending motion does not cause the Board to reconsider its prior decision in this case. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006)(a motion to reconsider must allege a material factual or legal error, assert that the Board erred in affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision without opinion, or argue a change in law).
 
The respondent claims that his former attorney agreed to file an appeal but failed to do so. First, the respondent fails to explain why the untimely appeal was submitted almost 3 months past the June 22, 2009, due date. Given the respondent’s lack of diligence, we will not consider this appeal under our sua sponte authority. Matter of Liadov, 23 I&N Dec. 990 (BIA 2006)(Board has authority to consider a late appeal by certification under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c), under appropriate circumstances).
 
Moreover, contrary to his arguments, the respondent fails to show compliance with Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, including that counsel be notified of the charges against him, and a disciplinary complaint be filed. Sako v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 857, 863 (6th Cir. 2006). The motion claims that proof of a disciplinary complaint, and proof of payment made to counsel for the appeal, is submitted. In fact, no such evidence was provided by the respondent.
 
The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Laz L. Pittman, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In an order dated May 30, 2000, we determined that the respondent’s appeal was withdrawn by his departure from the United States. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.4.¿FN1º As a result, the Immigration Judge’s removal order became the final administrative decision in the case. Nearly a decade after our order was issued, the respondent filed the instant untimely motion to reopen seeking an opportunity to apply for adjustment of status. The respondent makes an argument that his prior waiver of appeal was not knowing and intelligent, but does not contest the finding in our last order that he departed from the United States while his attempted appeal was pending.¿FN2º He has therefore not persuasively challenged our finding that we lacked jurisdiction over the appeal. His departure from the United States likewise precludes our consideration of his motion to reopen. Ovalles v. Holder, 577 F.3d 288, 297 (5th Cir. 2009) (citing Quezada v. INS, 898 F.2d 898 474, 476 (5th Cir. 1990), and upholding the application of the post-departure bar even in circumstances where there is a claim that the deportation order was not legally executed or did not comply with due process); Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008).
 
We add that, even if the respondent’s departure did not deprive us of jurisdiction, we would deny the motion because it is untimely. Id. The respondent asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, but even if that were the case (and we do not make such a finding now), he has not demonstrated that he has acted with due diligence in pursuing his claim. In this regard, we point out that the respondent’s affidavit asserts that he learned of our 2000 order in 2006.
 
Further, the respondent mentions that he is filing a U Visa application. However, he has not established his prima facie eligibility for a U Visa, as it is not supported by the certification required by section 214(p) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1184(p). Additionally, even if he had not departed, the pursuit of a U Visa would not impact his removal proceedings unless the Department of Homeland affirmatively joined the respondent in requesting that the proceedings be reopened and terminated pending its adjudication of the U Visa petition. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(i). That is not the case here.
 
To the extent that the respondent is requesting that we reopen pursuant to our sua sponte authority in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), we lack authority to do so as a result of his departure. Ovalles v. Holder, supra; Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, supra. We also alternatively find that resort to that extraordinary remedy is not warranted in the circumstances presented here. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

We note for the respondent’s benefit that a similar regulation was in effect at the time of his departure. See 8 C.F.R. § 3.4 (1999).

2

Our last decision did not find that we lacked jurisdiction because of his waiver of appeal. See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993). We did not need to reach that argument because his departure would result in the withdraw of an appeal even if appeal had been reserved.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Laura Michalec
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on June 18, 2009, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(C) (alien convicted of firearms or destructive device violation), and denying the respondent’s motion to terminate the proceedings. On January 22, 2010, the respondent moved the Board to reopen the proceedings based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Iavorski v. U.S. I.N.S., 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent asserts that his former attorney failed to challenge the charge of removability and to seek relief on his behalf. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion, which is untimely, will be denied. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
In his motion, the respondent specifically argues that the crime underlying the charge of removability is not an aggravated felony. See generally section 101(a)(43) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43) (defining “aggravated felony”). We agree. See, e.g., U.S. v. Gamez, 577 F.3d 394 (2nd Cir. 2009) (finding that an alien’s prior conviction under New York law for criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree was not a conviction for a crime of violence, and therefore, not an aggravated felony). The respondent, however, was not found to be removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. The respondent has offered no arguments or evidence that the crime rendering the respondent removable under section 237(a)(2)(C) of the Act, i.e., attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, in violation of section 110/265.03 of the New York State Penal Law, is not a firearms offense.
 
The respondent further argues that he is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), and a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). The respondent, who plead guilty and was convicted of the crime underlying the charge of removability on June 4, 2008, is ineligible for section 212(c) relief. See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001); Cyrus v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 197 (2nd Cir. 2007). Furthermore, the respondent, who became a lawful permanent resident on December 2, 2005, is ineligible for cancellation of removal because as the result of his June 4, 2008, conviction, he cannot establish the 5 years of lawful permanent residence required under the Act. See sections 240A(a)(2), (d)(1) of the Act.
 
*2 Finally, the respondent, who claims that his mother became a naturalized United States citizen when he was 16 years old, argues that he is now a United States citizen pursuant to section 321 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1432. See Motion to Reopen at 2. Section 321 of the Act, however, was repealed and replaced by section 320 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1431. The respondent, who was born on March 13, 1986, became a lawful permanent resident on December 2, 2005, when he was 19 years old. Therefore, he was not eligible to derive United States citizenship at the time of his parent’s naturalization. See section 320(a)(3) of the Act.
 
In sum, the respondent has not shown that he suffered prejudice in these proceedings as a result of his former attorney’s handling of the case. See Iavorski v. U.S. I.N.S., supra. Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen will be denied.¿FN1º
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent also claims that he is now married to a United States citizen. He has also submitted a copy of receipt of a visa petition application filed on his behalf on February 27, 2003, as the unmarried child of a United States citizen. The respondent, however, has neither requested reopening to apply for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255, nor complied with the regulatory requirements for reopening to apply for such relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William Z. Reich, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Denise C. Hochul
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Waiver of inadmissibility
 
*1 The respondent has appealed an Immigration Judge’s January 17, 2008, decision, finding the respondent removable as charged and ordering her removed to Canada. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has opposed the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including any determination of credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); see also Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493, 496 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent was previously placed in removal proceedings in September 2003 by the issuance of a Notice to Appear (“NTA”), which alleged that she had been convicted of a controlled substance violation in 1985 and alleged that she failed to disclose any arrest or conviction when she applied for a visa in June 2003. On the basis of these allegations, she was charged under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), for being inadmissible at the time of entry under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) for her drug violation, and under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) for procuring admission by willful misrepresentation of a material fact. During those removal proceedings, the respondent, through counsel, admitted to the allegations, conceded removability, and requested voluntary departure (Tr. at 21, June 1, 2004 hearing). The Immigration Judge granted the respondent 120 days to voluntarily depart in lieu of removal. The parties accepted the Immigration Judge’s decision as final and the respondent confirmed that she understood the ruling (Tr. at 23-24, June 1, 2004 hearing).
 
On December 24, 2005, upon applying for admission to the United States at the Canadian border, the respondent was once again placed in removal proceedings. The NTA contained the very same factual allegations as the previous NTA and charged her under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act as removable for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation, and under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act for engaging in fraud. Through new counsel, the respondent admitted to the drug conviction and her removability on this ground, but she denied that she made any misrepresentations in procuring her visa (Tr. at 6, Aug. 23, 2006 hearing). In this regard, the respondent’s attorney asserted that the respondent was never asked about prior arrests or convictions in applying for her visa, and argued that any concession to the contrary made by her former attorney constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.¿FN1º
 
*2 However, the Immigration Judge found that the doctrine of res judicata precluded the respondent from contesting and relitigating these issues, given the respondent’s prior admissions and concessions. The doctrine of res judicata “provides that a final judgment on the merits bars a subsequent action between the same parties over the same cause of action.” Channer v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 527 F.3d 275, 279 (2d Cir. 2008). Because the removal charges are not identical in both of the respondent’s proceedings, however, it is the doctrine of collateral estoppel which applies in the instant case.
 
The doctrine of collateral estoppel applies in removal proceedings when there has been a prior judgment between the parties that is sufficiently firm to be accorded conclusive effect, the parties had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues resolved by and necessary to the outcome of the prior judgment, and the use of collateral estoppel is not unfair. Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 1984). It precludes parties to a judgment on the merits in a prior suit from relitigating in a subsequent action issues that were actually litigated and necessary to the outcome of the prior suit. Id. Such a prior judgment conclusively establishes the ultimate facts of a subsequent removal proceeding, and bars reconsideration of issues of law resolved by the prior judgment, so long as the issues in both proceedings arise from virtually identical facts and there has been no change in the controlling law. Id. at 67.
 
The prerequisites for collateral estoppel are satisfied in the respondent’s case. The Immigration Judge’s prior removal order was a final judgment between the same parties. Both the respondent and the DHS had a “full and fair opportunity” to litigate the factual issue of whether the respondent misrepresented her criminal history when applying for her visa and the legal issue of whether the respondent was removable on that basis. Thus, it is fair to accord the judgment conclusive effect.
 
The respondent’s argument that she did not have the opportunity to litigate the issue of fraud is belied by the record. She was given a full opportunity to do so, over the course of several hearings. In fact, when the respondent’s attorney indicated that the respondent may have received a pardon of her drug conviction in Canada, the Immigration Judge continued the case to allow her to discuss with the DHS the possibility of having the fraud charge withdrawn (Tr. at 13-14, Mar. 24, 2004 hearing). Apparently, no agreement to withdraw the charge was reached, as the respondent’s attorney admitted the allegations, conceded removability and sought only voluntary departure at the next hearing (Tr. at 21, June 1, 2004).
 
The respondent further contends that it is not clear from the record whether prior counsel actually admitted to both the drug charge and the fraud charge, as the Immigration Judge did not ask her to plead to each charge or allegation individually. However, the charges and allegations had been discussed at length during numerous previous hearings, and the respondent’s attorney had waived the reading of the allegations (Tr. at 1-2). Thus, counsel’s statement at the final hearing that the respondent was admitting to “the allegations” and conceding removability is sufficient in this case to cover all charges and allegations contained in the NTA (Tr. at 21, June 1, 2004 hearing). See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986) (absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal concession made by counsel is binding on the alien).
 
*3 The respondent also asserts that the Immigration Judge violated due process by refusing to play the audio tape of the prior hearing. To the contrary, the Immigration Judge offered to do just that, but the respondent’s attorney changed the subject and never returned to the issue (Tr. at 80). Likewise, the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request to order a transcript of the prior proceedings did not violate due process (Tr. at 84), as all parties had listened to the tapes and the Immigration Judge had offered to replay the tape in court. Moreover, the respondent suffered no prejudice, as we have a full copy of the transcript before us on appeal. See, e.g., Garcia-Villeda v. Mukasey, 531 F.3d 141, 149 (2d Cir. 2008) (“Parties claiming denial of due process in immigration cases must, in order to prevail, allege some cognizable prejudice fairly attributable to the challenged process”).
 
Accordingly, the respondent is barred by collateral estoppel from contesting or withdrawing her prior factual admissions. As such, her removability has been established and her appeal is dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent also argued that her former attorney filed the wrong waiver on her behalf and misadvised her to attempt to re-enter the United States while her waiver was pending. However, although the respondent filed a bar complaint against former counsel, she has not submitted any affidavit, nor has she presented any proof that her former attorney has been notified of the allegations, as required by Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for ineffective assistance of counsel claims.

*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals from the October 17, 2008, decision of the Immigration Judge which denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings which were held in absentia on July 3, 2008. The appeal will be sustained.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) and (iii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent’s prior counsel admits in his affidavit submitted with the respondent’s motion that his office incorrectly advised the respondent that he was not scheduled for a hearing because the attorney failed to record the new hearing date. The respondent’s own affidavit reflects that he repeatedly contacted his prior counsel’s office regarding the scheduled hearing and was incorrectly informed that it had been rescheduled. As a result of the misinformation supplied by prior counsel, the respondent missed his hearing. The respondent was thereby prejudiced, as he claims 20 years of residence in the United States and eligibility for adjustment of status. We also note that the Department of Homeland Security filed an affirmative non-opposition to the respondent’s motion. Because the attorney admits that his office incorrectly advised the respondent, the respondent has established ineffective assistance of counsel as the basis for his failure to appear.¿FN1º Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The appeal will be sustained, and the proceedings are reopened.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the motion is granted and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

Even where prior counsel confesses error, the better practice would be for the respondent to report such conduct to the appropriate bar officials.

IN RE: IBY AMAPOLA ASBUN
File: AXXX XX1 706 - Arlington, VA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew Williams, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Emily C. Reece
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 CHARGE:
 
Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
The respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s July 28, 2008, denial of a motion to continue her case will be dismissed. The respondent was convicted of grand larceny and has been pursuing sentence modification in state court which may then affect whether she is removable from the United States for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. The respondent seeks a continuance in order to await a petition for rehearing alleging a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel before the Virginia Supreme Court. Her claim was previously denied by the Alexandria Circuit Court and by the Virginia Supreme Court, which is why she is seeking a rehearing.
 
Based on the prior court decisions, we do not find that the respondent has established a likelihood of success on her motion before the state court. In addition, as noted by the Immigration Judge when denying her request for a continuance in immigration proceedings, the respondent was previously granted four continuances since the Notice to Appear was issued in 2006. As we have stated before, a motion for a continuance is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, and his decision denying such a motion will not be reversed on appeal unless the alien establishes, by a full and specific articulation of the particular facts involved or evidence which he would have presented, that the denial caused her actual prejudice and harm, and materially affected the outcome of her case. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29 (2009). We cannot find that the respondent has suffered prejudice here.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
