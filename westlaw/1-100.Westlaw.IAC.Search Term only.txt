IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maithe Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Manuel Ramirez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before us on June 23, 2016, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to terminate removal proceedings and ordering his removal from the United States. The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia, has submitted a second motion to reopen on August 15, 2019.1 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has submitted a brief opposing the respondent’s motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
For clarity, we provide a brief recitation of the undisputed facts and procedural history in this case. On April 3, 2015, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to terminate his removal proceedings, finding him inadmissible under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), because his Florida conviction for resisting an officer with violence is a crime involving moral turpitude. On October 30, 2015, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s second motion to terminate and ordered his removal from the United States to Colombia. On June 23, 2016, this Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision and dismissed the respondent’s appeal. Thereafter, the respondent filed a petition for review before the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, the controlling federal jurisdiction in this matter. On October 5, 2017, the Eleventh Circuit denied the respondent’s petition for review (see Respondent’s “Reply to DHS’ Opposition to the Respondent’s Motion to Reopen,” submitted on September 17, 2019, at Tab O).
 
On August 15, 2019, over 3 years after our decision, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen arguing that these proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of his prior counsel (see Respondent’s ““Corrected Motion to Reopen Removal Proceedings Based on Ineffective Assistance of Prior Counsel,” submitted on August 15, 2019, at 7-11 (“Motion to Reopen”)).
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely as it was filed over 3 years after the entry of the Board’s final administrative decision in this case. A party may file only one motion to reopen no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, it is well-settled that motions to reopen removal proceedings are disfavored and that reopening may properly be denied solely in the exercise of discretion. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 316 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988).
 
*2 In his motion to reopen, the respondent claims that he retained an attorney in December of 2017, for the purpose of reopening his proceedings, but his prior attorney made misrepresentations to him and never filed a motion on his behalf with this Board until almost 2 years later (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 7-9). The respondent further claims that although his prior attorney purportedly filed a motion to reopen with the Orlando Immigration Court, he failed to include evidence of the visa petition filed on his behalf by his United States citizen spouse (id. at 7-8).2
 
To establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, (1) the motion must be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent attesting to the relevant facts, (2) former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond, and (3) if the prior counsel’s conduct violated ethical or legal responsibilities, the motion should reflect whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988); see Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005) (confirming the applicability of these procedural requirements within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, wherein this case arises).
 
Although the respondent has submitted a copy of a grievance that was filed with the appropriate bar association against his former counsel, there is no evidence that the respondent provided his former attorney with an opportunity to respond to those allegations prior to filing the instant motion (see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at Exh. D).3 Significantly, the respondent has not established that his prior counsel’s conduct prejudiced him in any way, particularly since he has not shown a reasonable probability that his untimely4 motion to reopen would have been granted, but for his prior counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d at 1274. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the respondent has not established that reopening is warranted based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).
 
Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated a basis for the filing deadline to be equitably tolled See Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 713 F.3d 1357, 1363 n.5 (11th Cir. 2013) (stating that “equitable tolling requires a litigant to show (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way”) (internal quotations and citation omitted); see also Booth v. Carnival Corp., 522 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir. 2008) (stating that equitable tolling is an “‘extraordinary remedy’ that should be used sparingly, but courts may toll time limitations when an inequitable event prevents a party’s timely action”). Initially, we note that there is no evidence that the respondent took any action to seek reopening of his case until he was detained by the DHS in July of 2019 (see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 7 ¶ 21). Although the respondent claims that he retained the services of his prior attorney in 2017, and he was under the impression that his prior counsel filed a motion to reopen on his behalf, the respondent has not explained why he took no further action until 2019 when he was detained by the DHS (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 7 ¶ 26 and 9 ¶ 39). Thus, we conclude that the respondent has not demonstrated due diligence in pursuing his right to seek reopening such that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled. See Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 713 F.3d at 1363 n.5.
 
*3 Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the respondent has not shown that untimely reopening of these removal proceedings is warranted. We also conclude that the respondent has not shown exceptional circumstances that would warrant the favorable exercise of our sua sponte authority to reopen these proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to reopen sua sponte “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”).
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

Footnotes

1

The record reflects that the respondent’s prior counsel filed a motion to reopen with this Board on August 2, 2019. While that motion was pending, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen with the assistance of his present counsel.

2

We find the respondent’s argument unpersuasive, however, since his motion reflects that the visa petition was filed on August 7, 2019 (see Respondent’s ““Reply to DHS’ Opposition to the Respondent’s Motion to Reopen” at Tab L) - shortly before the instant motion was submitted - not in 2017 when the respondent married his United States citizen spouse or when his prior counsel purportedly filed his motion with the Immigration Court.

3

We also note that the respondent has not provided any additional information regarding the outcome of his bar complaint notwithstanding the passage of time during the pendency of this motion.

4

Notably, prior counsel’s motion would have been untimely even if he had not allegedly rendered ineffective assistance, since he was not hired until over a year after our entry of a final order of removal on June 23, 2016.

File: AXXX-XX4-263 - Memphis, TN

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eric A. Henton, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s July 15, 2019, decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia after he did not appear for a hearing on January 21, 2015. The respondent argues that exceptional circumstances should excuse his failure to appear. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded only if the alien files a motion to reopen: (1) within 180 days after the date of the removal order in which he establishes that his failure to appear was because of “exceptional circumstances,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1); or (2) at any time in which he establishes that he did not have proper notice of the hearing at which the removal order was entered. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely (IJ at 2). A motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days of the failure to appear. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. The respondent’s motion was filed on June 3, 2019, and was thus untimely by nearly 4 years.
 
We disagree with the respondent’s argument that the deadline set forth in section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act should be equitably tolled based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Respondent’s Br. at 8-11. First, the respondent has not specified when an attorney was initially retained in his case and whether that attorney could thus be charged with contributing to the respondent’s inaction in filing a timely motion to reopen within the relevant 180-day period (IJ at 2). Further, the Immigration Judge correctly concluded that the respondent did not satisfy the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to document an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (IJ at 2-3). The respondent did not submit documentary evidence to show that the impugned attorney has been both informed of the ineffective assistance of counsel allegation and provided with an opportunity to respond to the allegation. See id. at 639. Written correspondence between the respondent and his former attorney that was submitted in support of the respondent’s motion to reopen pertains only to a request for the respondent’s file. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab H. With respect to additional steps required under Matter of Lozada, the respondent has neither submitted evidence of a disciplinary complaint filed against his former attorney nor explained why such a complaint has not been filed. See id. These requirements are intended to discourage baseless allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See id. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not established that the deadline for filing a motion to reopen should be tolled because it is not apparent that the impugned attorney was retained during the relevant period and because the requirements to document an ineffective assistance of counsel claim have not been fulfilled. Accordingly, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely.
 
*2 We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request that proceedings be reopened sua sponte (IJ at 3-4). The Immigration Judge’s authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1134 (BIA 1999). It is not intended as a general remedy for instances where a respondent has not complied with the applicable law and regulations. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). The respondent in this case had proper notice of the hearing at which he was ordered removed and did not seek the reopening of proceedings until more than 4 years later. We agree with the Immigration Judge that sua sponte reopening was not shown to be warranted in this case.
 
For the aforementioned reasons, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Diana R. Blank, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Amit Patel
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Indonesia, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s April 24, 2018, decision that denied his motion to reopen. The respondent has also requested remand. The Department of Homeland Security opposes reopening. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion will be denied.
 
The respondent does not dispute that his motion to reopen is untimely, but instead contends that he warrants equitable tolling of the time limits or sua sponte reopening and remand. On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion because 1) the respondent was deprived of due process and effective assistance of counsel at his National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) interview; 2) the respondent was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel at his immigration court proceedings; and 3) the respondent’s prima facie eligibility for a U visa is sufficient to merit reopening in the Immigration Judge’s discretion (Respondent’s Br. at 13-39). In his supplemental brief, the respondent further argues that the Immigration Judge did not have jurisdiction over his removal proceedings and that the Board should reopen sua sponte due to a recent change of law (Respondent’s Supp. Br. at 7-21). In his motion to remand, the respondent argues that the Board should remand to the Immigration Judge because Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has found the respondent prima facie eligible for a U visa and granted him deferred action status (Respondent’s Motion to Remand at 5-12).
 
The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not considering the due process violations at the respondent’s NSEERS examination (Respondent’s Br. at 14). The respondent argues that his prior counsel committed ineffective assistance of counsel in the NSEERS examination process, but the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by any potential ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Br. at 17-21). Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988) (requiring, inter alia, prejudice to sustain an ineffective assistance of counsel claim). Under the former NSEERS registration requirements, the respondent was obligated to provide certain information, including whether he was in compliance with his nonimmigrant visa, and the presence of counsel would not have changed that obligation. Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 427, 440 (2d Cir. 2008) (registrees have no right to remain silent or to refuse to provide information about immigration status). The respondent did not, and does not now, dispute that he overstayed his nonimmigrant visa without authorization and therefore was removable as charged in the Notice to Appear (NTA) (Exh. 1).
 
*2 Although the respondent argues that, had counsel who represented him at the NSEERS interview screened him for potential U visa eligibility, the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service may not have issued the respondent an NTA, the respondent’s argument is speculative (Respondent’s Br. at 19-20). Moreover, he does not indicate what prejudice he suffered because his NSEERS counsel did not timely turn over his file to his later counsel (Respondent’s Br. at 19-20). Therefore, the respondent has not established that any ineffective assistance of counsel at the NSEERS interview prejudiced him in his removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge. He also has not established that the interviewing officers’ failure to delay the interview to wait for the respondent’s attorney, who arrived late, constituted conscience-shocking conduct or a deprivation of fundamental rights (Respondent’s Br. at 19). Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d at 447 (holding that pre-hearing regulatory violations are not grounds for termination of immigration court proceedings, absent prejudice that may have affected the outcome of the proceeding, conscience-shocking conduct, or a deprivation of fundamental rights.)
 
The respondent further argues that his second attorney was ineffective during removal proceedings because she did not challenge the NTA and did not screen him for potential U visa eligibility (Respondent’s Br. at 21-30). We agree with the Immigration Judge, however, that the respondent has not established prejudice because he has not established that he was not removable as charged in the NTA or that he was eligible for any relief the Immigration Judge may grant. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1) (only the USCIS has jurisdiction over U visa petitions). 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.14(c)(ii), (c)(iv)(5)(i)(B) (outlining eligibility to apply for a U visa despite a removal order or from outside the United States).
 
In his appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge overlooked some of his claims and evidence in his motion to reopen (Respondent’s Br. at 11). Because the respondent has not established that he merits reopening for the reasons discussed above, we do not address these potential omissions.
 
In his supplemental brief, the respondent also argues that the NTA served on him was defective under the Supreme Court’s decision in Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018), because it did not include the time and place of his hearing and therefore the Immigration Judge did not have jurisdiction over his proceedings (Respondent’s Supp. Br. at 7-10). Since the respondent filed his brief, however, the Second Circuit and the Board have issued decisions regarding Immigration Court jurisdiction over proceedings begun by such defective NTAs. Banegas Gomez v. Barr, 922 F.3d 101, 110-111 (2d Cir. 2019) (“[W]e conclude that Pereira’s self-described disposition of this ‘narrow question,’... is not properly read to void jurisdiction in cases in which an NTA omits a hearing time or place.”); Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441 (BIA 2018) (holding that a notice to appear that does not specify the time and place of an alien’s initial removal hearing vests an Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over the removal proceedings and meets the requirements of section 239(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a), so long as a notice of hearing specifying this information is later sent to the alien). On May 30, 2003, the Immigration Court sent a notice of hearing which specified the time and place of his hearing. Therefore, the Immigration Judge properly had jurisdiction over the respondent’s 2003 removal proceedings.
 
*3 In his motion to remand, the respondent argues that the Board should remand proceedings because the USCIS has found him prima facie eligible for U visa status and has placed him in deferred action status due to the unavailability of U visas (Respondent’s Motion to Remand at 5-12). The respondent contends that reopening would “allow him to avail himself of the relief for which...he is eligible,” but does not indicate that he is eligible for any relief that the Immigration Judge can grant (Respondent’s Motion to Remand at 10). See 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.14(c)(1), (c)(iv)(5)(i) (outlining procedures for motions to reopen of respondents with final orders of removal who have been granted U visas by the USCIS). Until the respondent is granted a U visa, he remains removable and therefore the Immigration Judge cannot terminate proceedings. See Matter S-O-G- & F-D-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 462 (A.G. 2018). As the outcome of the proceedings will not change due to the approval of a U visa, the new evidence is not material. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(1), (c)(4) (motion to remand based on new evidence must be, inter alia, material). Accordingly, the respondent has not established eligibility for a motion to remand. See also Matter of L-V-K-, 22 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1999).
 
The respondent also argues that the Board should reopen the proceedings sua sponte (Respondent’s Supp. Br. at 20). We decline to do so, however, because, as discussed above, the respondent has not established eligibility for any relief the Immigration Judge may grant, and therefore has not established “a substantial likelihood that the result in his case would be changed if reconsideration or reopening is granted.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216, 1219 (BIA 2000).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered:
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

IN RE: LEANA PATRICIA OLIVIA RENDEROS
File: AXXX-XX9-706 - New York, NY
January 23, 2020
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marisa-Andrea Moore, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; termination
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 23, 2018, that denied her motion to reopen proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under a clearly erroneous standard, and all other issue de novo. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
The record reflects that the respondent was placed in removal proceedings by personal service of a Notice to Appear (NTA) on November 1, 2013 (Exh. 1). The NTA informed the respondent of the consequences of failing to appear for an immigration hearing and advised the respondent of her responsibility to keep the Immigration Court informed of her current address. The record reflects that the respondent provided an address in the Bronx, New York, and that she was released on her own recognizance pending an immigration hearing (Exh. 2).
 
The respondent alleges in an unsworn statement that she thereafter reported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in January 2014 (Respondent’s Mot. at Tab A). The respondent was informed that her next reporting date was in August 2014, but she claims that she somehow became confused and believed that she was required to report in October 2014. The respondent claims that she remained in contact with ICE through April 2014. The respondent claims that ICE gave her permission to relocate to an address in Nebraska, which she provided to an immigration officer. However, the respondent states that she did not move to that address because no one met her when she arrived in Nebraska. The respondent moved instead to an address resulting from a chance encounter with another woman from Honduras. The respondent indicates that after moving to Nebraska, she lost contact with the family at the Bronx address she had provided on her release from immigration detention. The respondent claims that she was in possession of an ICE document with an appointment scheduled for October 4, 2014, in Omaha, NE.1 However, the respondent did not keep the appointment because the person she had arranged to transport her to Omaha telephoned to cancel the trip. That person informed the respondent that she had contacted the appointment location directly and was told that a removal order had been entered against the respondent.
 
The respondent indicates that she took no steps to inform immigration authorities of her circumstances after learning of the removal order because she did not know whom to contact (Respondent’s Mot. at Tab A). The respondent states that she consulted various un-named attorneys about her situation. However, she did not hire anyone. The respondent argues that she was prevented from pursuing reopening in a timely manner because none of the attorneys she consulted advised her to file a motion for the purpose. The respondent filed the instant motion after accumulating funds to hire her current counsel.
 
*2 The respondent asserts on appeal that language barriers and a lack of education constitute exceptional circumstances that prevented her from reporting her change of address and appearing for her scheduled removal hearing (Respondent’s Br. at 6). See section 240(b)(4)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(4)(C) (providing for rescission of an in absentia order of removal within 180 days upon a showing of exceptional circumstances). The respondent argues that the 180 day time limit for filing a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances should be equitably tolled. She argues that informing ICE of her move to Nebraska, the respondent’s alleged intention to report for a scheduled appointment with immigration authorities in that state, and her alleged consultations with various attorneys about her situation demonstrates diligence in attempting to comply with her responsibilities in removal proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 5). Alternatively, the respondent argues that these proceedings should be terminated because the NTA served on her to commence the removal proceedings was defective (Respondent’s Br. at 7-15). The respondent also requests in the alternative that this Board exercise its sua sponte power to reopen and reinstate the proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 15).
 
The respondent’s motion to terminate is based on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018), holding that the NTA in that case, which did not designate a specific time or place of an alien’s hearing, was not a “Notice to Appear” under section 239(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a), for purposes of qualifying for cancellation of removal (Respondent’s Mot. at 1-3). The respondent argues that inasmuch the NTA in her case was similarly defective, because it did not specify a date and time for his initial hearing, the NTA could not confer jurisdiction over this matter on the Immigration Court. Therefore, the order of removal entered by the Immigration Judge is invalid, and the proceedings should be terminated.
 
The respondent is correct that the NTA issued to her does not specify the time or date on which her initial hearing would be held (Exh. 1). However, in Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441, 447 (BIA 2018), this Board held that a NTA that does not specify the time and place of an alien’s initial removal hearing will vest an Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over removal proceedings and meet the requirements of section 239(a) of the Act so long as a notice of hearing specifying that information is later sent to the alien. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reached the same conclusion in Benegas Gomez v. Barr, 922 F.3d 101, 110-11 (2d Cir. 2019) (rejecting jurisdictional argument for termination based on Pereira v. Sessions, and agreeing with the Board’s reasoning in Matter of Bermudez-Cota). There is no dispute that the respondent was issued a notice for her initial hearing, and constructive receipt is indicated because the notice was sent to the address of record for the respondent. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that termination of the removal proceedings is warranted.
 
*3 The Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen will be affirmed. The motion is untimely. As indicated above, the Immigration Judge correctly found that the respondent may be charged with constructive receipt of her hearing notice because it was sent to the last address she provided to the Immigration Court (IJ at 1-3). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated due diligence to equitably toll the 180 day time limit for filing a motion to rescind the in absentia order of removal in this case. The respondent took no action to inform immigration authorities of her whereabouts and explain the failure to report for her schedule hearing even after the respondent became aware that she had been ordered removed (IJ at 2). The Immigration Judge properly rejected the respondent’s attempt to blame her inaction on the various un-named attorneys she consulted because, aside from the lack compliance with the procedural requirements designed to insure the truthfulness of claims ineffective assistance, the respondent’s assertions in that regard lack sufficient detail to show that she reasonably relied on the advice of prior counsel to her detriment (IJ at 3). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (outlining the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (an alien asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate prejudice).
 
The respondent’s argument that a language barrier and lack of education constitute exceptional circumstances excusing compliance with her responsibility to keep the Immigration Court apprised of her current address is also unpersuasive. The NTA reflects that the respondent received advisals concerning her responsibility to inform the Immigration Court of a change of address and the consequences of a failure to appear at future proceedings. The respondent does not claim that those advisals were not communicated or explained to her. Moreover, the respondent concedes that she was aware that she was required to keep ICE similarly informed of any change of address, yet nevertheless failed to do so. Therefore, it is not clear that she would have complied in any event. Under the circumstances, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s actions and explanations appear to reflect “a casual unconcern” with her legal responsibilities in removal proceedings (IJ at 4). We affirm his determination that the respondent did not establish exceptional circumstances that would excuse her failure to appear.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen sua sponte will also be denied. The respondent has not presented exceptional circumstances to justify sua sponte reopening in the exercise of discretion, as she merely seeks to evade the regulatory requirements for rescission of the in absentia order of removal. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. at 984 (stating that the power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship).

ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nima M. Moshggoo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Termination
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s June 19, 2018, orders finding him removable, denying his motion to terminate proceedings, and ordering him removed to his native Ghana. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including the credibility determination, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues involving questions of law, judgment and discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to terminate proceedings. The respondent sought termination in order to have his Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, adjudicated by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). He reports, and has provided evidence showing, that a prior application for naturalization was denied on December 4, 2007, as he did not demonstrate the requisite good moral character for naturalization (Motion, Tab B). When he subsequently attempted to submit another application for naturalization, it was administratively closed on March 24, 2018, because he was in removal proceedings (Motion, Tab C).
 
In denying the respondent’s motion to terminate, the Immigration Judge found that no good cause had been shown (6/19/18 IJ Order). The respondent argues on appeal that his prior counsel failed to properly question the authority of the Immigration Services Officer to issue the Notice to Appear (Respondent’s Br., para. 12; Exh. 1). Although he asserts that he had ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has not complied with any of the requirements for reopening based on such a claim (Respondent’s Br. at 16-18). Twum v. INS, 411 F.3d 54 (2d Cir. 2005); see also Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005) (stating that a respondent who fails to comply substantially with the Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) requirements for reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel “forfeits” his claim). Therefore, reopening or termination in this regard is not appropriate.
 
The respondent did not identify any basis upon which termination of the proceedings was warranted. He neither challenged the validity of the factual allegations contained in the Notice to Appear, nor the charges of removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act (Exh. 1).
 
Furthermore, the respondent’s desire to challenge the denial of his original naturalization application, and/or the administrative closure of his second application, without more, is not a basis for termination of the proceedings. Rather, he has not shown that he is eligible for naturalization as he has not addressed the determination that he did not satisfy the good moral character requirement. Sections 101(f)(8), 316(a)(3) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 329(d); see also Matter of Castillo-Perez, 27 I&N Dec. 664, 666 (BIA 2019). Furthermore, removal proceedings may only be terminated pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1239.2(f) where the Department of Homeland Security has presented an affirmative communication attesting to an alien’s prima facie eligibility for naturalization. See, e.g., Matter of Acosta-Hidalgo, 24 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2007). No such attestation is of record.
 
*2 The respondent’s motion may also be viewed as being in the nature of a request for adjournment of the proceedings. In this regard, we note that the Immigration Judge properly found he did not present good cause for such a request. See Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 790-92 (BIA 2009) (setting forth factors to consider in determining whether good cause exists for a continuance to await adjudication of a pending visa petition, including prima facie eligibility for adjustment); see also Matter of L-A-B-R- et al, 27 I&N Dec. 405, 407 (A.G. 2018) (stating that continuances may only be granted upon a showing of good cause); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6.
 
Since the respondent did not demonstrate good cause for either termination or adjournment of the proceedings, the Immigration Judge properly denied his motion to terminate. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jodi M. Goodwin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Francisco J. Muniz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the July 24, 2018, decision of the Immigration Judge denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on December 3, 1999, as an inadmissible returning resident who was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. See sections 101(a)(13)(C)(v), 212(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(13)(C)(v), 1182(a)(2)(A)(i). His removal order was effectuated the next day and, according to the respondent, he returned to the United States the same month (Respondent’s Br. at 4; Motion to Reopen at 63).1
 
An alien seeking to reopen his removal proceedings must file a motion within 90 days of the date of his administratively final order of removal.2 Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). The respondent does not argue that the instant motion was filed within 90 days of his removal order becoming final but rather argues that the deadline should be equitably tolled because (1) the Immigration Judge who presided over his 1999 removal proceedings misapplied the law by determining that his conviction was an aggravated felony, thus rendering him ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a); and (2) he obtained incorrect advice from a series of attorneys over the years since his removal (Respondent’s Br. at 5-10).3 An alien seeking reopening past the 90-day deadline is entitled to equitable tolling if he establishes “(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.” Lugo-Resendenz v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016).
 
Here, we discern no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that equitable tolling does not apply because the respondent has not identified any extraordinary circumstances that prevented him from filing a timely motion to reopen (IJ at 2). See Penalva v. Sessions, 884 F.3d 521, 525 (5th Cir. 2018) (“[W]hether equitable tolling applies to a [respondent’s] motion to reopen is a question of fact.”) (quoting Dominguez v. Sessions, 708 F. App’x 808, 812 (5th Cir. 2017)); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Specifically, the respondent does not persuasively explain how the Immigration Judge’s conduct during the removal proceedings “stood in his way and prevented” him from filing a motion to reopen within 90 days after the proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 6-8). Lugo-Resendenz v. Lynch, 831 F.3d at 344. He has also not presented any evidence showing that he sought legal advice within the 90-day period following the entry of his removal order (Motion to Reopen at 63). Therefore, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen on the basis that it was untimely (IJ at 2).
 
*2 In addition, the prior Immigration Judge’s legal conclusion that the respondent’s conviction was an aggravated felony, which would make him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal, did not render the proceedings fundamentally unfair. The respondent did not meaningfully contest that he was removable as charged in the Notice to Appear (NTA) before the Immigration Judge, nor did he pursue his right to appeal, and “because an alien’s eligibility for discretionary relief from removal [such as cancellation] is not a liberty or property interest deserving of due process protection, an IJ’s failure to explain the eligibility for such relief does not rise to the level of fundamental unfairness.” United States v. Cordova-Soto, 804 F.3d 714, 723 (5th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation omitted); see also Miresles-Zuniga v. Holder, 743 F.3d 110, 112 (5th Cir. 2014) (noting that cancellation of removal is a discretionary form of relief).
 
The respondent also has not identified any newly submitted material evidence that was “not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104 (1988) (A motion to reopen may be denied if “the movant has not introduced previously unavailable, material evidence.”). Specifically, the respondent has not explained how (1) his conviction record dated May 13, 1996, (2) evidence of continuous physical presence prior to 1996, and (3) evidence of positive equites prior to service of the NTA were unavailable during his 1999 removal proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 11). Thus, we also affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision on the basis that the motion does not allege any new facts to be proven (IJ at 2).
 
Because we affirm the decision below on the foregoing bases, we need not address the respondent’s arguments regarding the Immigration Judge’s exercise of discretion (IJ at 2; Respondent’s Br. at 11-13).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The facts in the record do not conclusively establish the manner in which the respondent reentered the United States. However, if he reentered without first obtaining permission from the Attorney General to apply for admission, he would be subject to reinstatement of his prior removal order under section 241(a)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5), and ineligible for reopening or any form of relief. See Martinez v. Johnson, 740 F.3d 1040, 1043 (5th Cir. 2014); Anderson v. Napolitano, 611 F.3d 275, 278-79 (5th Cir. 2010).

The respondent is barred from seeking sua sponte reopening under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) due to his departure from the United States. See Ovalles v. Holder, 577 F.3d 288, 299-300 (5th Cir. 2009).

The respondent does not clearly articulate an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. To the extent he is attempting to raise such a claim, he has not complied with the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 2014) (requiring strict compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey B. Rubin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In an April 12, 2018, decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent appeals from that decision and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not file a brief in reply to the respondent’s appeal.1 The respondent additionally requests termination of proceedings. The request will be denied, and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from an Immigration Judge’s decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent argues that proceedings should be terminated for lack of jurisdiction (Respondent’s Br. at 1, 4-6); we disagree. A notice to appear (NTA) that does not specify the time and place of the alien’s initial removal hearing vests an Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over the removal proceedings when a notice of hearing specifying that information is later sent to the alien. Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441, 445-47 (BIA 2018); see Goncalves Pontes v. Barr, 938 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2019). The NTA served on the respondent did not list the date and time of his initial removal proceeding, but the notice of hearing served on him one month later provided the missing information (Exh. 1; Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings, June 10, 2010). Thus, the respondent’s jurisdictional argument is unavailing because the NTA, coupled with the notice of hearing, vested the Immigration Judge with jurisdiction. Therefore, we will deny the respondent’s request for termination of proceedings.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely (Respondent’s Br. at 6; DHS’s Opposition to Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 1). See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). However, the respondent advances two arguments to show his motion warrants the “‘rare remedy”D’ of equitable tolling. See Neves v. Holder, 613 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 2010) (quoting Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 396 (2007)). To prevail in this regard, the respondent must show “extraordinary circumstances” prevented him from complying with the statutory deadline and that he “diligently pursued his rights the entire period he seeks equitably tolled.” See id. (citing Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir. 2000)); see also Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 649 (2010). The respondent’s first argument, that a serious illness prevented him from attending his final hearing, is of little benefit because the record indicates that the respondent was hospitalized for 1 day--over 7 years before he filed the motion to reopen notifying the Immigration Court of the reason for his absence (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 4-6, 12, 37-40). See Guerrero-Santana v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 90, 94 (1st Cir. 2007) (“The doctrine is not available as a means of rescuing a party who has failed to exercise due diligence.”).
 
*2 The respondent’s second argument--that his attorney provided ineffective assistance2 by stating that he had no relief available following the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order (see Respondent’s Br. at 7; Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 4-7, 13)--is unpersuasive as it is unaccompanied by compliance with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Ferreira v. Ban, 939 F.3d 44, 45-46 (1st Cir. 2019). “[T]he Lozada requirements are designed to give the BIA sufficient information to inform its decision without resorting to an evidentiary hearing.” Id at 46. Absent such an evidentiary basis, we decline to conclude that the respondent’s former counsel provided ineffective assistance--particularly when the respondent had years to gather evidence in support of his claim. See Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 9, 11-13 (1st Cir. 2004). Therefore, the respondent’s motion was untimely filed and did not warrant equitable tolling of the statutory deadline.
 
Furthermore, the respondent has not demonstrated that the particular circumstances of this case presents an “exceptional situation” that warrants the exercise of sua sponte authority to reopen these proceedings as a matter of discretion. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (“[A]s a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”) (citing Matter of J-J-, 22 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997))). We note that many aliens who have been present in the United States for a period of years have accumulated favorable equities subsequent to being ordered removed and generally these are not so exceptional as to warrant reopening sua sponte. See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216, 1218 (BIA 2000) (“[I]t is the respondent’s burden to demonstrate that such a situation exists.”). In the present case, upon consideration of the record, including the respondent’s arguments of eligibility for adjustment of status relief and his family ties in the United States (Respondent’s Br. at 7-8), we conclude that sua sponte reopening is not warranted. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

However, the DHS opposed the respondent’s motion to reopen before the Immigration Court.

We construe the respondent’s position that “his attorney gave him the wrong advice” as an assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel in this context, because a less serious, “‘garden variety claim of excusable neglect”D’ would not warrant equitable tolling. See Holland, 560 U.S. at 651-52 (quoting Irwin v. Dep’t of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990)).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Areg Kazaryan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on May 10, 2018, when we denied the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen the Board’s dismissal of his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal due to ineffective assistance of his prior counsel. On September 11, 2019, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of his prior counsel.1 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred. See Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000); Matter of L-V-K-, 22 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1999). An alien is allowed to file a motion to reopen and to rescind an in absentia order of removal based on exceptional circumstances or because the alien did not receive a notice of hearing issued under sections 239(a)(1)-(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229(a)(1)-(2). Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). However, an alien may file only one such motion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The motion therefore will be denied as barred by regulation.
 
Even if we reached the merits of the motion, we remained unconvinced that the respondent has established that he put forth a viable ineffective assistance of counsel claim. To the extent that the respondent is continuing to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and has submitted another letter from his prior counsel explaining in more detail why the respondent showed up a day late for his hearing, the respondent still has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his prior counsels’ actions or inactions (Respondent’s Motion, Attachment). The respondent’s motion reiterates the arguments raised in his prior motion. We considered those arguments and found them unpersuasive when viewed within the record as a whole before we denied his previous motion.
 
Regardless of whether the respondent has shown attorney error, he has not met his burden of demonstrating that counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced him, where the Immigration Judge verbally advised the respondent of the date of his hearing and personally served him with the notice of hearing (IJ at 1). Irrespective of prior counsel providing purportedly erroneous information to the respondent and the Immigration Judge, the respondent was aware that his immigration hearing was April 14, 2005. Martinez -Hernandez v. Holder, 778 F.3d 1086, 1088 (9th Cir. 2015) (an alien can show prejudice where counsel’s performance may have impacted the outcome of the case).
 
*2 Further, we do not find that the respondent’s case presents an exceptional situation that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

MALPHRUS, Board Member:
In a decision dated November 2, 2017, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s applications for asylum and withholding of removal under sections 208(b)(1)(A) and 241(b)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(1)(A) and 1231(b)(3)(A) (2012), and his request for protection under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted and opened for signature Dec. 10, 1984, G.A. Res. 39/46, 39 U.N. GAOR Supp. No. 51, at 197, U.N. Doc. A/RES/39/708 (1984) (entered into force June 26, 1987; for the United States Apr. 18, 1988) (“Convention Against Torture” or “Convention”). The respondent has appealed from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
  
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Guatemala who entered the United States on April 24, 2016, without a valid entry document. He was *710 subsequently placed in removal proceedings where, through counsel, he conceded removability and filed applications for relief from removal.
 
The respondent’s persecution claim stems from an incident in Guatemala in 2016. He testified that he worked for 12 years as a salesman for a beverage distributor in Guatemala. In 2015, the respondent and six other employees were laid off, and he received a severance package of 167,000 quetzales (approximately $21,500). He used 70,000 quetzales to purchase land and cattle, and he went into the cattle business.
 
In the middle of 2015, a family member warned the respondent to be careful, telling him that a number of police cars had been spotted around his house. On March 13, 2016, the respondent received a phone call from an unknown person who asked him for 120,000 quetzales, stating that he knew the respondent had money. When the respondent said he had no money, the caller said, “Yes. We know you do.” The caller told the respondent he must pay, or he and his associates would kill the respondent’s family.
 
**2 Two weeks later, on March 31, 2016, five men wearing shirts with the insignia of the Policia Nacional Civil (“PNC”), Guatemala’s national police, appeared at the respondent’s door carrying high-caliber firearms. The respondent opened the front door part way, and the men pushed the door open and hit the respondent in the left shoulder with a gun, causing his shoulder to dislocate. The men also handcuffed the respondent and began trashing his house, looking for money. They threatened to cut off the respondent’s fingers if he did not pay them.
 
The respondent told the men that he had 10,000 quetzales in his car, which one of them retrieved. After he returned to the house with the money, another of the men received a phone call indicating that a neighbor had contacted the police to report a disturbance at the respondent’s house and that the police were en route. At that point, the men removed the handcuffs from the respondent and told him that he had 10 days to pay the balance of the amount they demanded, or he would be killed. One man threatened to take out the respondent’s good eye if he reported them to the police.1 The respondent did not report the incident to the police. He also did not see a doctor for his shoulder injury but was, instead, treated by a layperson.
 
The respondent left Guatemala, entered the United States on April 24, 2016, and filed an application for asylum on September 5, 2017. After an individual hearing, the Immigration Judge issued a decision pretermitting the respondent’s asylum application as time-barred. The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s application for withholding of removal, finding that he failed to establish that it was more likely than not he would face persecution on account of a protected ground and that the Government of Guatemala was unwilling or unable to protect him from his attackers.
 
*711 As to the respondent’s claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture, the Immigration Judge held that the respondent did not establish that the five men who beat, robbed, and threatened him were bona fide police officers. In the alternative, the Immigration Judge held that even if they actually were police officers, the respondent did not establish that the men acted in an official capacity, as opposed to acting for personal gain, or that they acted with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. For these reasons, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture. On appeal, the respondent contends that he has met his burden of proving that he is eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.
  
II. ANALYSIS
 
The primary issue in this case concerns whether the men who harmed the respondent were acting “in an official capacity,” that is, “under color of law” or were, instead, “rogue officials.” To resolve this issue, we must look to the language of both the Convention Against Torture and the implementing legislation and regulations. See generally INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 414 (1984) (beginning the analysis of the case by examining the relevant “sources of law”). We begin our analysis with the history and language of the Convention.
  
A. Convention Against Torture
 
**3 The United Nations Convention Against Torture was adopted by unanimous agreement of the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1984, and was entered into force on June 26, 1987.2 It established “a regime for international cooperation in the criminal prosecution of torturers, relying on the principle of ‘universal jurisdiction’ and the obligation to extradite or prosecute.” S. Exec. Rep. No. 101-30, at 2 (1990).
 
*712 Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture defines “torture” to mean
any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.
 
(Emphasis added). According to Article 3 of the Convention,
No State Party shall expel, return (“refouler”) or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.
 
 
The United States signed the Convention Against Torture on April 18, 1988, and the President transmitted it to the Senate on May 20, 1988, with several proposed conditions. In transmitting the document, the President observed that ““the Convention applies only to torture that occurs in the context of governmental authority, excluding torture that occurs as a wholly private act or, in terms more familiar in United States law, it applies to torture inflicted under color of law.” Message from the President of the United States Transmitting the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100-20, at 4 (1988) (emphases added). After the Convention was resubmitted to the Senate with revised conditions in 1990, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations passed a resolution of ratification for the advice and consent of the Senate. The accompanying report specifically stated that “acts of torture committed by private individuals are excluded.” S. Exec. Rep. No. 101-30, at 6. These documents are critical to understanding our nation’s obligations under the Convention and how we should determine what conduct is covered by it.
 
To implement the Convention domestically, Congress enacted section 2242 of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Division G of Pub. L. No. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822 (codified as a note to 8 U.S.C. § 1231), which provides that “the heads of the appropriate agencies shall prescribe regulations to implement the obligations of the United States under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture.” Id. § 2242(b).
 
**4 The United States Department of Justice promulgated an interim rule to implement the obligations of the United States under Article 3 in the context of removal of aliens. *713 Regulations Concerning the Convention Against Torture, 64 Fed. Reg. 8478 (Feb. 19, 1999). The rule created two separate provisions for protection under Article 3. Id. at 8489-90. The first provision established withholding of removal under the Convention for aliens who are not subject to the bars to eligibility in section 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c) (2000). The second, called “deferral of removal,” provided protection for aliens who are ineligible for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3)(B). See 8 C.F.R. § 208.17(a) (2000). The rule defined ““torture” with respect to both withholding of removal and deferral of removal, incorporating the provision in Article 1 of the Convention that torture must be “inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.” 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1) (2000).
 
The regulations governing claims raised in removal proceedings for protection under the Convention Against Torture are currently at 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c) through § 1208.18 (2019).3 Under 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1), the Convention extends to acts of torture that have been “inflicted by . . . a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.” (Emphasis added.) The regulation, like the treaty, envisions that torture could be inflicted by a government official who is acting outside the rubric of the Convention, that is, in a personal capacity. The history and purpose of the treaty reflect that its protection was intended to apply only to torture that occurs in the context of governmental authority.
 
There is no indication that the Department of Justice intended to exceed the intent of the drafters of the treaty when the regulation was promulgated. Thus, under the treaty and its implementing regulation, torturous conduct committed by a public official who is acting “in an official capacity,” that is, “under color of law” is covered by the Convention Against Torture, but such conduct by an official who is not acting in an official capacity, also known as a “rogue official,” is not covered by the Convention.4 “Rogue officers” or *714 “rogue officials” are public officials who act outside of their official capacity, or, in other words, not under color of law.
  
1. Under Color of Law
 
**5 Although the regulations do not define the term acting “in an official capacity,” the Attorney General has interpreted the phrase to mean “under color of law.” Matter of Y-L-, A-G- & R-S-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 270, 285 (A.G. 2002) (“The scope of the Convention is confined to torture that is inflicted under color of law.” (citing Ali v. Reno, 237 F.3d 591, 597 (6th Cir. 2001)));5 see also United States v. Belfast, 611 F.3d 783, 808 (11th Cir. 2010) (noting that “there is no distinction between the meaning of the phrases “under the color of law’ and ‘in an official capacity”D’).
 
Giving deference to the Attorney General’s determination that acting “in an official capacity” means “under color of law,” two Federal courts of appeals have drawn from their own interpretation of that phrase in civil rights *715 case law to apply it in the immigration context. Ramirez-Peyro v. Holder, 574 F.3d 893, 900 (8th Cir. 2009) (“While our circuit has yet to adopt the agency’s interpretation of ‘in an official capacity’ as the equivalent of “under color of law’ as used in the civil-rights context as reasonable, we do so now.”); see also Garcia v. Holder, 756 F.3d 885, 891 (5th Cir. 2014) (stating that under the Attorney General’s standard, “we interpret under color of law as we would in a civil rights case”). We will follow that approach in analyzing a claim involving conduct by a public official who is not acting in an official capacity, that is, a “rogue official.”
 
We apply the law through case-by-case adjudication in removal proceedings under the Act, and in so doing, we have an obligation to promote consistency in the application of the immigration laws through Board precedent. See Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 248-49 (BIA 2014) (noting the role of Board precedent in defining the United States’ obligations under international agreements and in establishing that claims relying on those agreements are adjudicated with consistency in removal proceedings). See generally Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-603, § 115(1), 100 Stat. 3359, 3384 (stating Congress’ intent that “the immigration laws of the United States should be enforced vigorously and uniformly”). While no one case and no one circuit’s law is dispositive, we set forth a national standard based on the general import of civil rights law as relevant in the immigration context. See INS v. Orlando Ventura, 537 U.S. 12, 16-17 (2002) (per curiam) (recognizing the importance of allowing the Board to “make an initial determination” so that it “can bring its expertise to bear” on matters that arise in the immigration context).
 
**6 In the civil rights context, a public official “acts under color of law when he misuses power possessed by virtue of . . . law and made possible only because he was clothed with the authority of . . . law.” Ramirez-Peyro, 574 F.3d at 900 (alterations in original) (citations omitted). An act that is motivated by personal objectives is under color of law when an official uses his official authority to fulfill his personal objectives. Garcia, 756 F.3d at 892. “The dispositive question is whether the [official] was exercising the power [he or] she possessed based on state authority or was acting only as a private individual.” Butler v. Sheriff of Palm Beach County, 685 F.3d 1261, 1265 (11th Cir. 2012). In other words, in determining if a public official who engaged in torture was “acting in an official capacity,” it is key to consider if he was only able to accomplish the acts of torture by virtue of his official status. See United States v. Tarpley, 945 F.2d 806, 809 (5th Cir. 1991).
 
In evaluating if a public official is acting under color of law in inflicting torture, circuit courts have significantly relied on whether government connections provided the officer access to the victim, or to his whereabouts or other identifying information. For example, the United States Court of *716 Appeals for the Fifth Circuit determined in an extortion case that the offenders’ ability to obtain information about the victim’s whereabouts and his financial status from other public officials who had acquired that information in their official capacities was a strong indication that the offenders were acting in their official capacity. Garcia, 756 F.3d at 892-93. Two extortion attempts and threats to the victim in that case occurred shortly after he had provided required information to government officials: first, when he applied for a national identity card, and second, when he was stopped and questioned at a police checkpoint. Id.; see also Ramirez-Peyro, 574 F.3d 905-06 (remanding based on evidence that Mexican Government officials who, in their official capacity, obtained information about the victim’s identity and whereabouts could provide that information to drug cartels who would torture and kill the victim); United States v. Picklo, 190 F. App’x 887, 889 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (holding that a government official who robbed a person “acted under color of law because he identified himself as a state investigator, flashed a badge, and used his official status to get [the victim] to follow his instructions”). In these cases, the person’s official capacity effectively provided the means to access, locate, or harm the victim.
 
**7 In contrast, in Miah v. Mukasey, 519 F.3d 784, 788 (8th Cir. 2008), the Eighth Circuit approved of our conclusion that an elected official who attempted to take control of other people’s property was a “rogue” official because his actions fell outside of his official duties. In determining that the official was not acting in an official capacity, we noted that other government officials did not assist him but, instead, made an effort to investigate and prosecute him criminally for his illegal activities.
 
Also relevant to the analysis is whether a law enforcement officer was on duty and in his official uniform at the time of his conduct. If so, it is more likely that he acted under color of law. However, the use of an official uniform or service weapon is not dispositive of the issue, because those items can be obtained outside the normal channels of government operations, and they may not be necessary to the official’s ability to engage in the torturous conduct. See Barna v. City of Perth Amboy, 42 F.3d 809, 816-19 (3d Cir. 1994) (holding that a police officer did not act under color of law, even though he was in uniform and used a government-issued nightstick to beat the victim, because he was off-duty and outside his jurisdiction, and he did not encounter the victim as part of police business); see also Ramirez-Peyro, 574 F.3d at 901; Vargas Hidalgo v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 154 F. App’x 827, 829 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam). Moreover, in general, the higher a position in law enforcement that a person holds, the more likely his conduct will be under color of law, even if his actions are taken for personal gain. He is in a *717 position to more easily abuse his authority without adverse consequences than, for example, a line police officer.
 
A similar consideration is whether the officer threatened to retaliate through official channels if the victim reported his conduct to authorities. See Tarpley, 945 F.2d at 809 (holding that an assault by a police officer was under color of law where he repeatedly told the victim that, because he was an officer, he could beat and even kill the man without any consequences). In this regard, the Seventh Circuit held that, even though an officer attacked an inmate for personal reasons, he acted under color of law where he was on duty and in uniform at the time of the attack and enlisted the aid of other officers in the jail. United States v. Christian, 342 F.3d 744, 751-52 (7th Cir. 2003). This case reflects that consideration should be given to whether a government official is acting to fulfill purely personal objectives, but it is not dispositive of the rogue official question. By contrast, in Almand v. DeKalb County, 103 F.3d 1510, 1515 (11th Cir. 1997), the Eleventh Circuit determined that an officer’s conduct in breaking down an apartment door and raping a woman occupant while he was in uniform was not under color of law since there was no evidence that he accomplished the act because of the power he possessed under State authority. It was, instead, an act that any “ruffian” could have done. Id.
 
**8 It has been held that the use of government-issued equipment, such as a service weapon or handcuffs, to beat or restrain a victim does not automatically render the conduct under color of law. Rather, an Immigration Judge should consider whether a private citizen could obtain the same weapons or restrain the victim in the same manner. For example, in Butler, 685 F.3d at 1267-69, the court found that the officer’s use of her government-issued handgun and handcuffs on the victim did not mean that she acted under color of law, because someone who is not a law enforcement officer could also own a handgun and handcuffs and use them to restrain another person.
 
Whether a public official’s actions are under color of law is a fact-intensive inquiry, and an Immigration Judge should assess both the direct and circumstantial evidence to make this determination. When making factual findings regarding a public official’s conduct, the Immigration Judge should not rely on unproven assumptions to find that the official acted under color of law. In this regard, the First Circuit affirmed our holding that a police officer did not act under color of law when he repeatedly visited the applicant’s mother with other officers in uniform and asked for her daughter’s whereabouts. Costa v. Holder, 733 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2013). The court also noted the government’s on-going efforts to combat police corruption. It concluded that the direct and circumstantial evidence was too limited to draw the inference that the officers relied on their status as law *718 enforcement officers to threaten the mother, stating that any contrary determination would be an “unproven assumption[].” Id.
 
In sum, the key consideration in determining if a public official was acting under color of law is whether he was able to engage in torturous conduct because of his government position or if he could have done so without any connection to the government. Issues to consider in making this determination include whether government connections provided the officer access to the victim, or to his whereabouts or other identifying information; whether the officer was on duty and in uniform at the time of his conduct; and whether the officer threatened to retaliate through official channels if the victim reported his conduct to authorities.
  
2. Acquiescence
 
Even if a public official has engaged in torture in a private capacity, and therefore not under color of law, an alien may nevertheless qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture if he demonstrates that a public official or other person acting in an official capacity consented to or acquiesced in the torture. Khouzam v. Ashcroft, 361 F.3d 161, 171 (2d Cir. 2004). Acquiescence requires that “the public official, prior to the activity constituting torture, have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(7); see also Silva-Rengifo v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 473 F.3d 58, 67-70 (3d Cir. 2007) (stating that acquiescence includes both actual knowledge and willful blindness); Chen v. Gonzales, 470 F.3d 1131, 1141 (5th Cir. 2006) (same); Amir v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 921, 927 (6th Cir. 2006) (same); Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 369 F.3d 1239, 1242-43 (11th Cir. 2004); Khouzam, 361 F.3d at 171.
 
**9 An applicant may establish acquiescence by citing to evidence, particularly country conditions evidence, showing that the torturous conduct is “routine” and sufficiently connected to the criminal justice system for an adjudicator to reasonably infer that higher-level officials either know of the torture or remain willfully blind to it and therefore breach their legal responsibility to prevent it. Khouzam, 361 F.3d at 171.
  
3. Application to the Respondent
 
The Immigration Judge made alternative holdings to support his denial of the respondent’s claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture. First, he held that the respondent did not meet his burden of proving that the five men who beat, robbed, and threatened him were police officers. A private person who has no actual political or government affiliation is not a *719 “rogue official,” even if he purports to be a government official. For example, an individual who impersonates a police officer by flashing a fake badge is not a rogue official because that person is not a “public official” in the first place, let alone one acting under color of law, as required by the Convention and 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1).
 
The fact that the men wore shirts bearing the insignia of a government law enforcement agency and carried high-caliber weapons and handcuffs did not prove that they were actually police officers. As the Immigration Judge noted, the shirts could have been fake, and it is not unusual to expect a criminal to carry a weapon. Further, the men did not arrive at the respondent’s home in police vehicles, and their immediate departure after learning that an official police car was en route to investigate the disturbance is a further indication that they were not bona fide police officers. The Immigration Judge’s determination was a permissible view of the evidence, and there is no clear error in his findings in this regard.
 
In the alternative, the Immigration Judge held that, even if the men were police officers, the respondent did not establish that they were acting in an official capacity. He found, instead, that they were acting as rogue officials for personal gain.6 On appeal, the respondent primarily focuses on this alternative holding, which requires us to determine when a public official acts “under color of law” and thus triggers the protections of the Convention Against Torture. He claims that the facts of his case “strongly suggest” that the men who attacked him had access to him through official police channels. Even if they were police officers, this unproven assumption is insufficient to carry his burden to show that the men were acting under color of law at the time of the attack.
 
The evidence does not support the conclusion that a government position gave the men special access to the respondent’s house or to his private information, including the fact that he had been awarded a significant amount of money and kept the cash at his house. Although the respondent received a threatening phone call prior to the incident indicating that the caller and his associates knew he had money at the house, there is no evidence that the caller was a police officer or was associated in any way with the Guatemalan Government.
 
**10 Further, the men left immediately after learning that an official police car was en route to the respondent’s house to investigate the disturbance. They also threatened to take the respondent’s other eye out if he reported the incident to the police, raising further doubt that they were acting with government authority. See  *720 Suarez-Valenzuela, 714 F.3d 241, 248 (4th Cir. 2013) (finding no acquiescence where an officer tortured the applicant to keep him from testifying against the officer, thus evidencing that the officer feared official repercussions for his actions). The Immigration Judge reasoned that the men were concerned that they could be discovered by the police. He concluded that they would not have reacted in this manner if they thought they could act with impunity and had no reason to fear adverse consequences if their conduct was discovered by law-abiding officers. This was a permissible view of the evidence. See id.
 
Moreover, the fact that the men carried high-caliber weapons and handcuffs does not automatically place their conduct under “color of law” because, as the Immigration Judge explained, it is reasonable to expect that persons engaged in the criminal act of threatening and robbing others would carry weapons. See Butler, 685 F.3d at 1267.
 
Finally, it is significant that the respondent did not report the incident to the police. As a result, there is no way to evaluate whether the police would have investigated the incident and taken action against any of the attackers. See Joaquin-Porras v. Gonzales, 435 F.3d 172, 175, 181 (2d Cir. 2006) (upholding an Immigration Judge’s finding that a police officer’s rape of the alien, who did not report the incident to official authorities, was “an isolated attack by a corrupt official”); cf. Barajas-Romero v. Lynch, 846 F.3d 351, 355 (9th Cir. 2017) (noting that a local police officer refused to investigate an attack after the alien stated that the officer’s colleagues were responsible). It is not sufficient to simply assume that the police would not have responded. See Almutairi v. Holder, 722 F.3d 996, 1003 (7th Cir. 2013) (stating that “because [the alien] never mentioned the threatening calls to anyone in the Kuwaiti police or military, he could only speculate that the Kuwaiti government might not protect him if he did seek its help”). For all the above reasons, we conclude that even if the men were bona fide police officers, the Immigration Judge properly determined that they were not acting under color of law.7 We therefore concur with his denial of the respondent’s claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture.
  
B. Asylum and Withholding of Removal Under the Act
 
**11 The Immigration Judge also properly denied the respondent’s claim for asylum as time-barred because he did not file his application within 1 year of his arrival date. Section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Act. The respondent entered the United States on April 24, 2016, but did not file his asylum application until September 5, 2017. He did not identify, much less demonstrate, any *721 changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the late filing. See section 208(a)(2)(D) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(4)-(5) (2019). On appeal, he contends that he did not understand the instructions his prior attorney gave him on how to file the completed asylum application while he was in detention, and the attorney did not advise him of the consequences of failing to timely file. However, the respondent makes no claim that the attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Nor did he comply with the procedural steps for asserting such a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5)(iii)(A)-(C). Under these circumstances, the respondent’s asylum claim was properly pretermitted.
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish eligibility for withholding of removal under the Act because he failed to prove that he was persecuted in the past or that he faces a clear probability of persecution upon his return to Guatemala. See section 241(b)(3)(A) of the Act; Stevic, 467 U.S. at 429-30; 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b).
 
Persecution is “an ‘extreme concept,’ requiring ‘more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.”D’ Sepulveda v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). To rise to the level of persecution, the claimed physical harm generally must involve severe mistreatment. See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 577 F.3d 1341, 1353 (11th Cir. 2009) (finding no persecution where the applicant was detained for 4 days, interrogated and beaten for 5 hours, and subsequently monitored by authorities, but he suffered no physical harm).
 
The respondent has not established that he suffered past persecution because the one incident where the men threatened him, put him in handcuffs, and beat and struck him on the shoulder with the butt of a gun was not severe enough to rise to the level of persecution. He was briefly detained in his home and did not suffer any permanent physical injury or seek formal medical attention from a doctor for his shoulder injury, being treated by a lay person instead. See Martin v. Sessions, 723 F. App’x. 35, 37-38 (11th Cir. 2018) (stating that an alien who did not testify that he suffered any injuries or sought medical treatment did not establish that the harm he alleged rose to the level of past persecution); Jian Qiu Liu v. Holder, 632 F.3d 820, 822 (2d Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (finding that an alien who “suffered only minor bruising from an altercation . . ., which required no formal medical attention and had no lasting physical effect” had not experienced past persecution).
 
**12 In the absence of past persecution, the respondent is not entitled to a presumption of a clear probability of future persecution. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1). He has not presented evidence that anyone is looking for him or asking about his whereabouts. On this record, the respondent did not establish past persecution or a clear probability of future persecution to *722 meet the high burden of proof to qualify for withholding of removal. See Chen v. Gonzales, 470 F.3d 1131, 1138 (5th Cir.2006) (stating that “the requirement of “clear probability’ of persecution requires the applicant to show a higher objective likelihood of persecution than that required for asylum”); Matter of Y-B-, 21 I&N Dec. 1136, 1139 (BIA 1998); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2).
 
Further, the Immigration Judge did not clearly err in finding that the respondent failed to establish that the Government of Guatemala is unwilling or unable to protect him from the men who threatened and beat him. An alien “who alleges persecution by a private actor must prove that his home country is unwilling or unable to protect him” because the Act only protects him “against persecution by non-governmental groups that the government cannot control.” Ayala v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 605 F.3d 941, 950 (11th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted); see also De Castro-Gutierrez v. Holder, 713 F.3d 375, 381 (8th Cir. 2013) (stating that “an alien seeking to establish persecution based on the violent conduct of private actors must show more than ‘difficulty controlling’ private behavior” (citation omitted)); Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 337 (A.G. 2018) (same). It was proper for the Immigration Judge to find that the reason the respondent’s attackers fled when they learned an official police car was en route was that they feared bona fide police officers were coming to the respondent’s aid. See Guillen-Hernandez v. Holder, 592 F.3d 883, 887 (8th Cir. 2010) (stating that certain evidence reflected that the applicant “fear[ed] punishment at the hands of a government ready and willing to enforce its criminal laws”).
 
The respondent also did not report the threatening phone call or the incident at his house to the police, and there is no showing that it would have been futile to do so. See Mulyani v. Holder, 771 F.3d 190, 199 (4th Cir. 2014) (noting that the alien “never notified the police or any other governmental authorities” about the attacks on her, and her claim that the government was unable or unwilling to control her attackers was belied by the fact that they fled when a man nearby yelled at them). We recognize that failure to report persecution to local authorities does not automatically bar an alien from asylum and withholding of removal. See Lopez v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 504 F.3d 1341, 1345 (11th Cir. 2007). However, a failure to report “generally is fatal” to a persecution claim unless the alien can show it would be futile to make a report, which the respondent did not do. Id. (citing Mazariegos v. Office of U.S. Att’y Gen., 241 F.3d 1320, 1327 (11th Cir. 2001)); cf. Matter of S-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 1328, 1335 (BIA 2000) (excusing the applicant’s failure to request protection from the Moroccan Government as futile).
 
**13 The country conditions evidence in the record that reported on crime and safety issues in Guatemala also does not establish that it would have been *723 futile for the respondent to report the beating incident to the police. See U.S. Dep’t of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Sec., Overseas Security Advisory Council, Guatemala Crime Safety Report (2017, 2018). Although the reports reflect that the PNC lacks personnel and training to control gang activity and that police investigations typically do not result in an arrest or a conviction, they also indicate that the PNC has made some progress in the reduction of crimes. Further, the fact that the police were dispatched to the respondent’s home when they were called is evidence that the Immigration Judge reasonably considered in finding that it would not have been futile for the respondent to report the beating incident. Consequently, we conclude that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s application for withholding of removal under the Act.8
  
III. CONCLUSION
 
The Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s application for protection under the Convention Against Torture. He determined that the men who beat, robbed, and threatened the respondent were not public officials and, even if they were, they were not acting in an official capacity and were therefore rogue officials. Further, the Immigration Judge properly concluded that the respondent did not establish his eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal under the Act. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent lost one eye in a fireworks accident when he was 12 years old.

Adoption of the Convention Against Torture in 1984 culminated more than a decade of efforts at the international level to prohibit the practice of torture. In 1973, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 3059 rejecting “any form of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” G.A. Res. 3059 (XXVIII) (Nov. 2, 1973). Two years later, it adopted the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. G.A. Res. 3452 (XXX) (Dec. 9, 1975). The Declaration was the foundation for the Convention.

3

Prior to 2002, the regulations regarding the Convention Against Torture in Part 208 of title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations were issued by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”), which was part of the Department of Justice. The functions of the INS were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, § 403, 116 Stat. 2135, 2178 (amended 2003). The Department of Justice subsequently published a final rule reorganizing title 8 to reflect the transfer of those functions and the division of jurisdiction over the regulations. See Aliens and Nationality; Homeland Security; Reorganization of Regulations, 68 Fed. Reg. 10,349, 10,349 (Mar. 5, 2003) (Supplementary Information).

We recognize that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that there is no “rogue official” exception to protection under the Convention Against Torture and 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a). Barajas-Romero v. Lynch, 846 F.3d 351, 362-63 (9th Cir. 2017). The court reads the regulation’s use of the word “or” rather than “and” between the phrases “public official” and “other person acting in an official capacity” to mean that torturous conduct may be inflicted by a public official acting in a private capacity and be covered by the Convention Against Torture. This is inconsistent with our interpretation of the regulation, which, like the treaty, “deals only with torture committed in the context of governmental authority” or “inflicted under color of law.” S. Exec. Rep. No. 101-30 at 6, 14; see also 64 Fed. Reg. at 8483.
Regarding the regulatory language, the issue is whether the phrase “acting in an official capacity” is intended to qualify only the term “other person,” or if it also applies to “a public official.” If the regulation is read as “a public official” or “other person acting in an official capacity,” it would provide protection to persons tortured by a public official acting in a private capacity, such as a police officer, or even any government employee who acted in furtherance of his own personal objectives. In our view, this was not the intent of the Convention or the regulation, and the best reading of the regulation is that the phrase “acting in an official capacity” qualifies both ““a public official” and “other person.”
The Ninth Circuit’s interpretation also appears to imply that the term ““public official” is limited to law enforcement or security officials (local or national) who engage in torturous conduct. However, neither the Convention nor 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1) defines the term “public official” in this manner. See Kamara v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 420 F.3d 202, 215 (3d Cir. 2005). Furthermore, its common meaning may include any person in a government position. The term therefore extends beyond law enforcement officers and could apparently encompass other government workers such as teachers and postal workers. See generally Kasneci v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 202, 205 (1st Cir. 2005) (addressing a claim that alleged attacks by townspeople dressed in military uniforms “were carried out by or with the acquiescence of a public official”). This is especially true in forms of government where most employees work for the State. The broadness of the term “public official” further supports our view that it is modified by the phrase “acting in an official capacity” in the regulation.

5

Contrary to the respondent’s argument, Matter of Y-L-, A-G- & R-S-R- remains good law on this point.

6

The Immigration Judge also determined that the respondent did not establish that the five men were acting with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.

7

The Immigration Judge’s reasons for determining that the men were rogue officials were based on reasonable inferences that, while not dispositive as to that fact, were proper for him to make.

8

The Immigration Judge also held that the respondent’s proposed social group was not cognizable under the Act. However, given our disposition of the appeal on other grounds, we need not address this aspect of the decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Amy M. Crossin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Theresa L. Cummings
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider the Board’s February 25, 2019, decision finding that he had waived appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision ordering him removed to his native Mauritania. The Department of Homeland Security opposes reconsideration. The motion is denied.
 
The respondent contends that he did not knowingly or willingly waive appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision. In an affidavit, he states that he did not know what his attorney said at the end of his hearing, and that he was told by her boss “not to worry about” the fact that the paperwork reflected that he had waived his appeal (Motion, Tab A). He avers that he never intended to waive his right to appeal, and always wanted to pursue his case to the extent possible.
 
However, current counsel was aware at the time she filed the respondent’s appeal that the Immigration Judge’s order of removal indicated that both parties had waived appeal. No motion was filed to accept the appeal notwithstanding that information. Absent egregious circumstances, an individual is bound by his attorney’s admissions and concessions. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). Although the respondent now indicates that he was unaware that his attorney waived appeal, he was present at the time of this concession (Tr. at 50, 53). In addition, the respondent has not complied with the requirements for reopening of the proceedings or reconsideration of the Board’s decision based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where this case arises, requires strict compliance with Lozada in order to put forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Hernandez- Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 2014). There is no evidence that the respondent has filed a complaint against former counsel, or reached out to her directly at the contact information provided by her former firm (Motion, Tab B), or at the address reflected on prior counsel’s entry of appearance. Nor does the current motion establish prejudice, as it puts forth no substantive argument for why the respondent should not have been found removable as charged. As the respondent has not complied with the requirements for reconsideration based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, reconsideration is not warranted. Accordingly, the motion is denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michelle N. Mendez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 9, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent subject to removal as charged. On April 2, 2019, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The record before us does not contain a reply to the motion from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the motion is therefore deemed unopposed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The proceedings will be reopened and the record will be remanded.
 
The respondent has acknowledged that his motion was not filed within the 90-day filing period established for motions to reopen. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). He argues, however, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during proceedings and that equitable tolling applies to his motion. He also argues that his motion is based on a claim of United States citizenship, which affects the jurisdiction of the Board and the Immigration Court, and that sua sponte reopening is warranted.
 
The respondent has submitted with his motion evidence that includes the respondent’s own statement, a statement from his father, and evidence of the law in his native Liberia concerning marriage, separation, and custody. The respondent argues that his evidence, along with the evidence of record, establishes that he derived United States citizenship from his father under the citizenship law applicable to him, specifically former section 321(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1432(a), repealed by section 103(a), title I, Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-395, 114 Stat. 1631. See Matter of Nwozuzu, 24 I&N Dec. 609 (BIA 2008) (analyzing a derivative citizenship claim under former section 321(a) of the Act).
 
The respondent argues that the attorney who previously represented him failed to obtain the information necessary to establish that he met the requirements for derivative citizenship under former section 321(a) of the Act. Specifically, the attorney failed to show that the respondent’s father had a marital relationship with the respondent’s mother under the law of Liberia and that his parents were legally separated after the respondent’s birth.
 
The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims, as set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 l&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). He has also submitted evidence in support of his citizenship claim that is sufficient to warrant a new hearing. A claim to citizenship raises issues directly related to this Board’s jurisdiction over the instant case. See Matter of Cantu, 17 I&N Dec. 190, 194 (BIA 1978). Here, we find it necessary to reopen proceedings and remand the record for fact-finding and analysis as to whether the respondent has established derivative United States citizenship.
 
*2 Given our finding, we need not address whether the respondent’s former attorney provided less than competent counsel or whether equitable tolling applies to the respondent’s motion.
 
The following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The proceedings in this matter are reopened pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Erika Nicole Salter, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated May 22, 2019, denying his request for a continuance and ordering his removal from the United States. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent does not dispute that, at the present time, he is subject to removal from the United States as a result of his conviction for failure to appear (IJ at 1-2; Exhs. 1, 1A). Section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). He also does not allege that he is eligible for any form of relief from removal which can be granted by an Immigration Judge or this Board.
 
The respondent’s desire to collaterally challenge his conviction before the Texas state courts does not warrant a continuance of these removal proceedings. We recognize that, at the present time, the respondent’s appeal of the decision of a district court’s decision denying his writ of habeas corpus is currently pending before the Texas Eleventh Court of Appeals.2 See Ex parte Rogelio Villegas Dominguez, No. 11-19-00223-CR (Tex. 11th Ct. App. filed July 9, 2019).
 
Despite the pendency of his post-conviction relief claims, the respondent’s conviction remains final and effective for immigration purposes. Okabe v. INS, 671 F.2d 863, 865 (5th Cir. 1982). Likewise, even though his post-conviction relief claims are based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, nothing in Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010), suggests that removal proceedings must be stayed while a Padilla-based claim is pursued in post-conviction proceedings. Lopez v. Holder, 521 F.App’x 349, 350 (5th Cir. 2013). Overall, while the respondent may believe that he will ultimately prevail on the merits of his post-conviction relief claims, the outcome of his state court proceedings is too tentative and speculative to support a continuance of removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6; Cabral v. Holder, 632 F.3d 886, 890 (5th Cir. 2011); Matter of L-A-B-R-, 27 I&N Dec. 405, 417 (A.G. 2018).
 
*2 If the respondent believes that he should be permitted to remain in the United States while the Texas courts consider his post-conviction relief claims, he is not precluded from requesting a stay of removal from the Department of Homeland Security. 8 C.F.R. § 241.6. However, for the reasons set forth above, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to conclude these proceedings by ordering the respondent’s removal from the United States to Mexico. The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Proceedings before the Immigration Judge were completed at the Johnson County Jail in Cleburne, Texas. The Immigration Judge conducted the hearings there from the Immigration Court in Dallas, Texas, via video teleconference pursuant to section 240(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act.

The respondent, on appeal, has presented copies of his filings with the Texas courts, including his First Amended Application for Writ of Habeas Corpus and his Notice of Appeal. We decline to remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge to consider the evidence in the first instance as such evidence has not been shown to change the outcome of this case. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472 (BIA 1992).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jin Sun Park, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Steven Michael Nelson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Termination
 
*1 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appeals an Immigration Judge’s April 9, 2019, decision termination proceedings without prejudice. The respondent has filed an opposition. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic. He was admitted to the United States in 2000 as a lawful permanent resident. On December 11, 2017, he was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree. As a result of this conviction, he was placed in proceedings and charged with removability under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), for a controlled substance violation.
 
The respondent filed a motion to terminate on the ground that his conviction was not yet final for immigration purposes. See Matter of J.M. Acosta, 27 I&N Dec. 420 (BIA 2018). In support of his motion, he submitted evidence that he had filed an untimely Notice of Appeal, which the criminal court accepted, and that his criminal appeal is currently pending. In addition, the respondent submitted evidence showing that he was challenging the conviction on substantive grounds because, inter alia, he alleged that his former criminal attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel for a number of reasons (Motion to Reconsider, Exhs. B and C). Based on this evidence, the Immigration Judge terminated proceedings without prejudice.
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed. Although the respondent did not file a timely appeal from the criminal conviction, he rebutted the presumption of finality by presenting evidence that his appeal had been accepted. Matter of J.M. Acosta, 27 I&N Dec. at 432. The DHS does not dispute that an appeal of the respondent’s underlying conviction was accepted and is currently pending in the New York Supreme Court (DHS Br. at 4).
 
In addition, the respondent presented evidence that the appeal related to a substantive defect in his underlying criminal proceedings because, inter alia, he alleges that his former criminal attorney did not provide effective assistance of counsel. Matter of J.M. Acosta, 27 I&N Dec. at 432. See e.g., Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010); Matter of Marquez Conde, 27 I&N Dec. 251, 254-55 (BIA 2018) (convictions vacated for procedural or substantive defects in the underlying criminal proceedings are not valid for immigration purposes); Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621, 624-25 (BIA 2003) (distinguishing convictions that have been set aside for reasons related to a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, which are not final for immigration purposes, from those vacated because of rehabilitation or immigration hardship), rev’d on other grounds, 465 F.3d 263, 269 (6th Cir. 2006).
 
*2 On appeal, the DHS argues that the Immigration Judge was bound by his initial decision denying the motion to terminate, and therefore could not further examine the evidence and decide differently. We disagree as an Immigration Judge has the authority to reconsider a decision sua sponte at any time unless jurisdiction is vested with the Board. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (“An Immigration Judge may upon his or her own motion at any time, or upon motion of the Service or the alien, reopen or reconsider any case in which he or she has made a decision, unless jurisdiction is vested with the Board of Immigration Appeals.”).
 
The DHS also argues that, given New York criminal appellate procedure, criminal defendants may avoid removal simply by submitting a notice of appeal of the underlying conviction to the Immigration Judge without perfecting the appeal of his criminal convictions. The DHS contends that in a state with appellate procedures like New York, an Immigration Judge cannot definitively discern the basis of a criminal appeal until the perfected appellate filing is reviewed. The DHS posits that New York criminal appellate procedure does not have a mechanism to dismiss outstanding, unperfected criminal appeals so Matter of J.M. Acosta has created a situation where criminal defendants may avoid removal in perpetuity by simply filing frivolous, unperfected criminal appeals. See DHS Brief at 11-13.
 
The DHS does not define what “perfected” means in the context of its argument. Moreover, DHS’s argument, if taken to its logical conclusion, would obviate Matter of J.M. Acosta, a decision also involving the question of finality of a criminal conviction on appeal in the New York Supreme Court. Therefore, we decline to revisit Matter of J.M. Acosta at this time.
 
Further, Matter of J.M. Acosta sufficiently addresses DHS’s concerns as an Immigration Judge must decide whether the pending appeal relates to the issue of guilt or innocence or concerns a substantive defect in the criminal proceedings. Matter of J.M. Acosta, 27 I&N Dec. at 432. Here, in accordance with Matter of J.M. Acosta, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent proved that his pending criminal appeal challenged his conviction on substantive grounds. Accordingly, the following order will be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raymond G. Lahoud, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Karen E. Comery
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on September 24, 2018, when we granted a joint motion to reopen filed by the parties. The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic and a lawful permanent resident, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s April 22, 2019, written decision which found him subject to removal as charged and ordered him removed.1 The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a brief on appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.2
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On September 22, 2015, the respondent was convicted of Theft by Unlawful Taking - Movable Property in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 3921(a) and initially was sentenced to 12 months of probation (DHS Evidence Tabs C, F). On July 18, 2016, the respondent was resentenced to “a period of incarceration of not less than four months nor more than twelve months,” according to the order signed by the state court (DHS Evidence Tab F). The respondent, who was represented at his April 2, 2019, hearing specifically did not object to the admission of Exhibit F (Tr. at 41).
 
At the April 2, 2019, hearing, the DHS requested that the two charges of removability in the May 25, 2016, Notice to Appear, which had been sustained by a prior Immigration Judge, be withdrawn (Exh. 1). Therefore, he vacated the charges under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) (controlled substance) and section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) (two crimes involving moral turpitude) (IJ at 3). On February 14, 2019, the DHS lodged a new charge under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) (aggravated theft felony offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least 1 year) based on the respondent’s 2015 theft conviction (Form I-261, No Exh. Number; IJ at 6).3
 
The categorical approach requires that a reviewing court examine whether the elements of the offense underlying the conviction sufficiently correspond to the elements of the generic federal definition of the offense. See Mathis v. United States, 136 S.Ct. 2243, 2248 (2016). In determining what the state conviction necessarily involves, a court must presume that the conviction was based on the least of the acts criminalized under the state statute and decide whether those acts are encompassed by the generic offense. See Moncrieffe v. Holder, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 1684 (2013).
 
*2 The term “aggravated felony” includes a theft offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least 1 year. See section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G). A “theft offense” encompasses the “taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits of ownership, even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent.” See Matter of Garcia-Madruga, 24 I&N Dec. 436, 440 (BIA 2008). See also Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. 183 (2007); Matter of Ibarra, 26 I&N Dec. 809, 813 (BIA 2016); Matter of Cardiel, 25 I&N Dec. 12, 21 (BIA 2009).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). At the hearing on April 2, 2019, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s 2015 conviction under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 3921(a) is categorically a theft offense as defined by section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G) (Tr. at 43). See Matter of V-Z-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 1338, 1344-45 (BIA 2000) (any crime meeting the definition of “Theft by Unlawful Taking” under section 223.2 of the Model Penal Code for tangible or intangible personal property constitutes a “theft offense” for purposes of the Act). He noted that the respondent’s 2016 resentencing for a parole violation to “a period of incarceration of not less than four months nor more than twelve months,” meant that his sentence was considered to be for the stated maximum term that may be imposed (Id.). See Bovkun v. Ashcroft, 283 F.3d 166, 171 (3d Cir. 2002); United States v. Graham, 169 F.3d 787, 790 n.2 (3d Cir 1998); Rogers v. Pa. Bd. Of Prob. And Parole, 724 A.2d 319, 321 n.2 (Pa. 1999); Matter of D-, 20 I&N Dec. 827 (BIA 1994). Therefore, the Immigration Judge found that the DHS had established that the respondent had been convicted of an aggravated theft felony offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least 1 year, and he sustained the section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) charge in the Form I-261 (Id.).
 
*3 After the Immigration Judge sustained the aggravated felony theft offense removal charge at the hearing on April 2, 2019, the respondent, through counsel, submitted a motion to terminate (Tr. at 43; No Exh. number). He argued that it was not clear that he had been resentenced in 2016 to a term of imprisonment of at least 1 year based on an alleged “lack of clarity” contained in the transcript of the sentencing hearing which he attached to the motion to terminate (Respondent’s Motion to Terminate, p. 14-15).4 However, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had not objected to the admission of DHS Exhibit F, which was the signed court order indicating that he had been resentenced in 2016 for the 2015 theft conviction to “a period of incarceration of not less than four months nor more than twelve months” (Tr. at 45). The DHS later submitted a response to the motion to terminate in which it argued that the respondent’s sentence should be considered as a sentence of 12 months of imprisonment under applicable Third Circuit and Pennsylvania case law (DHS Response to Motion to Terminate, No Exh. Number).
 
On appeal, the respondent reiterates his contention that the DHS has not established that he was sentenced to at least 1 year of imprisonment based on the sentencing transcript attached to his motion to terminate (Respondent’s Br. at 7-11). However, the Immigration Judge previously considered and rejected this assertion, noting that the DHS had submitted a copy of the July 2016 sentencing order which reflected that the respondent had been resentenced for his 2015 theft conviction to “a period of incarceration of not less than four months nor more than twelve months.”5 In any event, his contention that the Immigration Judge should have weighed the evidence differently to reach a different conclusion does not persuade us of any error below. See Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. at 586 (BIA 2015).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.6
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

All references to the Immigration Judge’s decision are to the April 22, 2019, Immigration Judge’s decision.

2

On June 19, 2015, the respondent was granted cancellation of removal (IJ at 1). On December 28, 2016, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s October 4, 2016, decision which granted him voluntary departure because we were without jurisdiction inasmuch as we determined that he had waived appeal. On August 7, 2017, pursuant to a motion filed by the DHS with the Third Circuit which remanded the matter to the Board, we found that the respondent had knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal. In a separate decision also issued on August 7, 2017, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s January 11, 2017, decision to deny his motion to reopen and found that he had not established ineffective assistance of counsel based on his decision to request voluntary departure.

3

On May 12, 2016, the respondent also was convicted of Theft by Unlawful Taking - Movable Property in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 3921(a) (Id.). On April 12, 2017, this conviction was vacated by a Pennsylvania state court (IJ at 2). The DHS requested that factual allegation number 9 regarding the 2016 conviction be withdrawn at a hearing on April 2, 2019 (IJ at 3).

4

The transcript reflects that the state court judge indicated in relevant part: “the sentence of the Court is that you pay the costs of prosecution, undergo imprisonment in the Lehigh County Prison for a period of not less than four months nor more than 23 months - or 12 months.” (Respondent’s Motion to Terminate, Tab O, p. 73).

5

On appeal, the respondent concedes that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 3921(a) is materially identical to section 223.2 of the Model Penal Code and that the Immigration Judge was required to apply Matter of V-Z-S-, 22 I&N Dec. at 1338 to find that the respondent had been convicted of a categorical aggravated felony theft offense (Respondent’s Br. at 12-13).

6

The respondent also alleged in his motion that the Immigration Judge’s review was limited under the Board’s remand order of September 24, 2018, to the sole issue of whether he remained convicted for immigration purposes because his 2016 theft conviction was vacated (IJ at 4). However, the respondent has not raised this issue on appeal, and therefore he has waived it. Matter of R-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 657, 658 n.2 (BIA 2012) (when respondent fails to substantively appeal issue addressed in Immigration Judge decision that issue is waived before Board).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael C. Urbina-Pabon, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jack D. Spencer
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 20, 2019, decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia after he did not appear for a scheduled hearing on January 7, 2001. The respondent argues that notice was not proper in his case and he alternatively requests that proceedings be reopened sua sponte. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded where an alien files a motion to reopen within 180 days establishing that exceptional circumstances caused the failure to appear. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). An alien may file a motion to reopen at any time based on lack of notice of the underlying removal proceeding. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The respondent received personal service of the Notice to Appear (Ex. 1) that advised him of the need to attend all hearings and of the consequences of failing to appear. The respondent argues, in part, that he did not understand his obligation to attend removal proceedings because he was 15 or 16 years old at the time he was personally served with a Notice to Appear. See Respondent’s Br. at 6. However, removal proceedings may be properly commenced through service of a Notice to Appear on an alien who is 14 years or older (IJ at 2-3). See Matter of Cubor-Cruz, 25 I&N Dec. 470, 473 (BIA 2011); 8 C.F.R. § 103.8(c)(2)(ii). We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate that he did not receive proper service of the hearing notice through some fault of the attorney who filed a motion for a change of venue on his behalf (IJ at 3). See Respondent’s Br. at 6. The respondent has not complied with any of the requirements to establish ineffective assistance of counsel that are set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The motion for a change of venue was granted and the subsequent hearing notice was sent to the address provided in the motion. The hearing notice was not returned as undeliverable and the respondent has not overcome the presumption that the notice was properly delivered (IJ at 3). See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not met his burden to establish that notice was not proper in his case. See id.
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent argues that exceptional circumstances should excuse his failure to appear, see Respondent’s Br. at 6-7, such a motion is untimely by many years. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. As discussed, the respondent has not demonstrated that he did not receive proper notice of his obligation to attend proceedings or of the hearing itself (IJ at 3-4). The respondent alternatively argues that proceedings should be reopened sua sponte to facilitate his pursuit of an immigrant visa based on his marriage to a United States citizen. See Respondent’s Br. at 8. However, becoming potentially eligible for an immigration benefit many years after the entry of an in absentia order of removal is not unusual and we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances that warrant the sua sponte reopening of proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to reopen proceedings sua sponte is not meant to circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship).
 
For the aforementioned reasons, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stephanie M. Alcala, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 1, 2018. The Immigration Judge deemed the respondent to have abandoned any applications for relief due to his failure to file an application by the filing deadline, and ordered the respondent’s removal. The respondent’s appeal from that decision will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying him a continuance in order that he might prepare and submit unspecified applications for relief. We conclude that the respondent did not establish good cause for a further continuance. See Matter of L-A-B-R-, 27 I&N Dec. 405 (A.G. 2018); Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6.
 
The record reflects that the respondent was in proceedings since April 2014, and was granted multiple continuances in order to obtain counsel. At a hearing held on November 14, 2017, the Immigration Judge set a filing deadline of February 1, 2018, for any applications for relief. The Immigration Judge advised the respondent directly, as well as the respondent’s counsel, of the consequences of failure to file by the deadline (Tr. at 75-77). However, at the following hearing on February 1, 2019, the respondent and counsel appeared without any applications for relief. The respondent’s counsel stated that due to a calendaring error, he did not realize the matter was set for filing, and furthermore he was in the hospital a week prior (Tr. at 81-82). The Immigration Judge deemed any applications for relief abandoned, and ordered the respondent’s removal (IJ at 2-3).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The regulations provide that an Immigration Judge has the authority to set deadlines for the filing of applications, and may deem an application abandoned if it is not filed by the deadline established by the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.31(a), (c). The respondent’s arguments on appeal do not establish error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to deem his applications for relief abandoned. The record reflects that the respondent had sufficient time in which to prepare and submit any applications to the Immigration Court. See Matter of C-B-, 25 I&N Dec. 888, 889-890 (BIA 2012) (an applicant must be granted a reasonable and realistic amount of time and provided a fair opportunity to seek, speak with, and retain counsel); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983).
 
*2 Insofar as the respondent asserts that his counsel erred in miscalendaring the hearing, we note that he has not substantially complied with the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). We conclude that the respondent did not establish good cause for his failure to timely file any applications. We also note that on appeal the respondent has not submitted any completed applications, or identified any form of relief for which he may be eligible. We therefore conclude that a remand is not warranted. See Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 414 (BIA 1996) (holding that in order to justify a remand the applicant must establish prima facie eligibility for the underlying relief sought); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX-XX9-873 - New York, NY
July 11, 2019
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pankaj Malik, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s January 29, 2019, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia order of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) did not file a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or state custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 722-23 (BIA 1999).
 
The respondent entered the United States on March 11, 2001. He was detained upon entry, and on March 13, 2001, was personally served with a Notice to Appear (“NTA”). On September 25, 2001, a Notice of Hearing (“NOH”) was sent to the respondent, informing him that he should appear for his hearing on January 3, 2002, at the Immigration Court in New York, NY. The respondent did not appear for his hearing on that date, and an Immigration Judge ordered him removed after a hearing held in absentia. The respondent was mailed a copy of the in absentia removal order at his address on record.
 
More than 17 years later, on January 8, 2019, the respondent filed a motion to reopen his in absentia removal order with the Immigration Judge. On January 29, 2019, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion finding that he had not established exceptional circumstances or overcome the presumption of delivery of the notice of the hearing.
 
The respondent presents a due process challenge to the Immigration Judge’s 2002 in absentia order of removal, premised on his argument that he did not have proper notice of the hearing. The respondent asserts that he demonstrated a lack of notice or exceptional circumstances for not attending the scheduled hearing on January 3, 2002. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). He claims he only learned of the in absentia removal order in 2019 when he was taken into DHS’s custody (Respondent’s Br. at 6). He claims that the non-receipt of the January 3, 2002, hearing constitutes sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of delivery.
 
*2 The respondent’s motion to reopen and to rescind the in absentia removal order was untimely, as it was filed on January 8, 2019, more than 180 days after the in absentia removal order was entered on January 3, 2002 (IJ at 1-3). See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish that equitable tolling of the 180-day deadline for filing his motion is warranted (IJ at 3-4). Alternatively, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish that exceptional circumstances beyond his control excused his failure to appear for his January 3, 2002, hearing (IJ at 3-4). See section 240(e)(1) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
The respondent was personally served with an NTA, advised of his address obligations, and the NOH was sent to the address he provided on the Form I-830, Notice to EOIR: Alien Address (IJ at 1-2; Exh. 1; NOH dated September 25, 2001). Ineffective assistance of counsel may constitute an exceptional circumstance if the ineffective assistance results in an alien’s failure to appear at his hearing. See Aris v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595, 599 (2d Cir. 2008). We affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion to reopen based on his claim of ineffective assistance of prior counsel does not comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988) (IJ at 3).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the NOH mailed to the address in the Form I-830 was sufficient to constitute notice to the respondent (IJ at 4). The Form I-830 contains indicia of reliability. Specifically, the form indicates that upon release from legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) custody, the respondent reported his address to be 1047 Wilson Boulevard, Central Islip, New York 11722. In addition, the form is signed by a legacy INS officer. As the respondent was personally served with the NTA, he was required to notify the Immigration Court and the legacy INS of any change of address within five days. The last address provided by the respondent was the Form I-830, and therefore it was proper to use that address to send notice of hearing. Section 1229(a) of the Act requires notice of a change of address, yet does not place any restrictions on who may provide that notice.
 
The respondent asserts that unbeknownst to him, Ms. Quevedo, a notario, provided the address in the Form I-830 presumably when she posted bond. He implies that Ms. Quevedo did not advise him of the address she provided in the Form I-830. To the extent the respondent implies that because he did not sign the Form I-830, he is not responsible for the address reflected therein, we disagree (Respondent’s Br. at 4, 14). The notice indicates that the Wilson Boulevard address was provided by the respondent. The form does not indicate that the address was provided by Ms. Quevedo. The respondent has failed to show error in the mailing of the notice of hearing to the Wilson Boulevard address obtained from the Form I-830.
 
*3 We presume that a properly addressed notice sent via regular mail is received by the addressee. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). However, the burden of proof for rebutting that presumption is weaker when items are sent by regular mail as opposed to certified mail. See id. The Board considers all relevant evidence in determining whether an alien has rebutted the presumption. Such evidence includes but is not limited to factors such as affidavits from the respondent and others who are knowledgeable about whether notice was received, whether due diligence was exercised in seeking to redress the situation, any prior applications for relief that would indicate an incentive to appear, and the respondent’s prior appearance at immigration proceedings, if applicable. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 665; see also Matter of C-R-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 677 (BIA 2008).
 
We are not persuaded that the respondent has rebutted the presumption of delivery. The NOH was mailed to the address provided by the respondent upon release from custody (Form I-830). The Immigration Judge reasonably noted that although the respondent claims that he advised the court at his June 14, 2001, hearing that Ms. Quevedo’s address was not where he was residing, the record lacks a change of address form that reflects any other address for the respondent other than the one he “repeatedly provided to the Court” (IJ at 4 and n.4). See section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(B) (eliminating the notice requirement where the alien fails to provide the required contact information); see also M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 674-75 (finding that a respondent cannot evade delivery of a properly sent Notice of Hearing by relocating without providing the required change of address and then request reopening of in absentia proceedings on the basis of a claim that he did not receive notice) (citation omitted). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not rebutted the presumption of delivery.
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that he should have been provided more time to respond to the DHS’s opposition to his motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order (Respondent’s Br. at 7-10). The respondent asserts that before he had an opportunity to respond to the DHS’s opposition, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion (Id.). Citing the Immigration Court Practice Manual, the respondent contends that he should have been allowed 10 days to respondent to DHS’s opposition (Id. at 8-9). See Immigration Court Practice Manual Rule 3.1(b)(iv). However, the Immigration Judge is not bound by parties’ filing deadlines from the Immigration Court Practice Manual, which itself is not binding authority. Appendix D from the Manual states that the deadlines are for guidance only, and that the Immigration Judge has discretion to set deadlines. Although the respondent asserts that the DHS’s opposition was untimely (Respondent’s Br. at 7), the Immigration Judge has discretion as to deadlines. Moreover, the respondent has not articulated what his response would have been if he had been provided additional time to respond, or otherwise shown that the outcome of his case would have been different.
 
*4 The respondent also relies upon an unpublished Board decision (Respondent’s Br. at 16-17). However, as the respondent acknowledges, unpublished Board decisions are not binding precedents (Id.). Matter of Echeverria, 25 I&N Dec. 512, 519 (BIA 2011). Further, the unpublished Board decision presented by the respondent on appeal rests upon specific factual scenarios pertinent to that case.
 
Moreover, having received proper notice of his hearing, we agree with the Immigration Judge that under the totality of the circumstances, the respondent has not met his burden of establishing that his failure to appear for his scheduled hearing was due to “exceptional circumstances.” See Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, 509 (BIA 1996) (noting that one must look to the “totality of circumstances” to resolve this issue of exceptional circumstances); see also Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33 (BIA 1998); Matter of B-A-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 1998).
 
The respondent also asserts that the in absentia removal order cannot stand because it is based on a non-compliant NTA or NOH (Respondent’s Br. at 11-12). He relies on Matter of Bulnes, 25 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 2009) and Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001). We disagree. For the reasons cited above, the respondent has not established that he received less than sufficient notice. Therefore, on this record, he has not established a non-compliant NTA or NOH.
 
Further, if it is necessary to reach this issue, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not shown that he exercised due diligence in his case (IJ at 4). The respondent does not allege that he took any steps to inquire into the status of his case during the more than 17-year period between the issuance of the in absentia removal order on January 3, 2002, and the filing of the motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order on January 8, 2019.
 
The record establishes that the respondent was properly notified of the time and place of his scheduled removal hearing. The respondent does not allege that he was in Federal or state custody at the time of the hearing, and has not otherwise shown that his failure to appear was due to “exceptional circumstances” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act. We are not persuaded by the respondent’s arguments that the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order should be rescinded. See 8 C. F. R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Therefore, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen his in absentia removal order.
 
*5 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

REISSUED DECISION
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on April 11, 2019, when we denied the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen. On May 29, 2019, the respondent, through counsel, filed the instant motion to reissue our prior order to enable him to petition for judicial review of the Board’s prior order. The Department of Homeland Security has not opposed this motion. The respondent’s attorney admits that she rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in advising the respondent that a timely petition for judicial review of the Board’s order could have been filed until May 24, 2019, when, in fact, the deadline to file such petition was May 11, 2019. Upon consideration, the respondent’s unopposed motion to reissue will be granted pursuant to our sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reissue is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated April 11, 2019, herewith attached, is hereby reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals the Immigration Judge’s February 6, 2019, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia order of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a motion for summary affirmance. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was detained shortly after entry into the United States in 2006. He was issued a Notice to Appear, specifying that he was to appear at the Immigration Court in Harlingen, Texas, on April 4, 2006, at 9:30 a.m. He concedes that he knew he was supposed to appear on April 4, 2006 (Motion to reopen, Tab C). He asserts that he did not appear because he moved to Houston and hired an attorney who turned out to be a notary. He asserts that the notary told him she would have his hearing moved to Houston, and that it might take a year or longer. The respondent claims he returned to her office a couple of months later, and she was no longer there. The respondent does not assert that he did anything else to obtain information about his removal proceedings or his immigration status until 2018.
 
A motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days after entry of the order. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that the deadline for filing his motion to reopen should be equitably tolled.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate the required due diligence to merit equitable tolling of the entire period, approximately 12 years, that he seeks to toll. See Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 649 (2010) (holding that the doctrine of equitable tolling will only be invoked when an applicant shows “that he has been pursuing his rights diligently”). The lack of any indication that the respondent contacted the Immigration Court or did anything else during the years after losing contact with the notary to show he was pursuing his rights diligently precludes him from demonstrating due diligence to merit equitable tolling of the time for seeking reopening and rescission of his in absentia removal order. The respondent otherwise does not establish any basis for reopening these proceedings. Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jody E. Santiago, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cynthia A. Gutierrez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening; termination
 
*1 This case was last before us on April 30, 2002. At that time, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s underlying January 6, 2000, decision, in which he denied the respondent’s motion to reopen the proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on October 22, 1999, pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). On July 23, 2018, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider and terminate the proceedings in light of Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018), and in the alternative, a motion to reopen and remand to the Immigration Judge. The Department of Homeland Security has filed a response in opposition to the respondent’s motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reconsider is untimely because it was not filed within 30 days of our April 30, 2002, decision. See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The respondent argues that his motion should be considered timely under the doctrine of equitable tolling. He argues that the Supreme Court’s decision in Pereira v. Sessions constitutes an extraordinary circumstance that prevented him from timely filing a motion to reconsider and that he pursued his case with reasonable diligence. He further argues that, under Pereira v. Sessions, the “putative” notice to appear issued against him did not specify the time and place of his first removal hearing and was insufficient to vest the Immigration Judge and the Board with jurisdiction over the proceedings. Thus, the respondent argues that the Board should terminate the removal proceedings.
 
We deny the respondent’s motion to the extent that he argues that the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction pursuant to Pereira v. Sessions. See Respondent’s Motion at 4-6. Subsequent to the Supreme Court’s opinion in Pereira, the Board issued Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441 (BIA 2018), in which we held that Pereira does not stand for the proposition that the respondent contends. See Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. at 443; Karingithi v. Whitaker, 913 F.3d 1158 (9th Cir. 2019) (deferring to the Board’s decision in Matter of Bermudez-Cota);; Lopez v. Barr, No. 15-72406, 2019 WL 2202952, at* 8 (9th Cir. May 22, 2019) (noting that a regulation, not the statutory definition of a notice to appear, governs what a notice must contain to vest jurisdiction and that Pereira simply has no application to the Immigration Court’s jurisdiction). Additionally, the respondent’s case is controlled by Matter of Miranda-Cordiero, 27 I&N Dec. 551, 554 (BIA 2019), in which we distinguished Pereira and held that pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), a notice to appear that did not specify the time and place of the initial removal hearing does not require the rescission of an in absentia order of removal nor termination of proceedings. See also Matter of Pena-Mejia, 27 I&N Dec. 546, 548 (BIA 2019). Under these circumstances, we conclude that jurisdiction properly vested with the Immigration Judge such that reconsideration of our prior decision, reopening and rescission of the in absentia order of removal, or termination of these proceedings on jurisdictional grounds is not warranted.1
 
*2 The respondent also argues in the alternative that the Board should reopen the proceedings and remand to the Immigration Judge based on the ineffective assistance of his prior attorney. He acknowledges that his motion to reopen is untimely as it was filed more than 90 days after the final order of removal. See section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). However, he argues that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled because he did not learn of his prior attorney’s ineffective assistance until he met with his new attorney on July 17, 2018, and that he acted with due diligence in pursuing his case. Further, he argues that his prior attorney’s ineffective assistance prejudiced his case because she did not submit any evidence in support of the motion to reopen his in absentia removal order, which deprived him of the opportunity to remedy the prior in absentia order and to seek any relief from removal.
 
We conclude that, while the respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), he has not demonstrated due diligence warranting equitable tolling of the filing deadline. In order to be entitled to equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must show due diligence in discovering his attorney’s deception, fraud, or error. Bonilla v. Lynch, 840 F.3d 757, 582 (9th Cir. 2016). Three factors are considered: (1) if (and when) a reasonable person in the respondent’s position would suspect the specific fraud or error underlying the motion to reopen; (2) whether the respondent took reasonable steps to investigate the attorney’s suspected fraud or error, or, if the respondent is ignorant of the attorney’s shortcomings, whether he made reasonable efforts to pursue relief; and (3) when the tolling period should end; that is, when the respondent definitively learns of the harm resulting from counsel’s deficiency. Id.; Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2011).
 
The respondent was 16 years old at the time he entered the United States and has stated in his affidavit attached to his motion that his father hired Attorney Reinholdt to file a motion to reopen the in absentia removal order with the Immigration Judge and an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion with the Board. He states that after the Board denied his appeal in 2002, he assumed his case was lost and that he did not become aware of the ineffective assistance of Ms. Reinholdt until he met with and retained his new attorney Jody Santiago in July 2018.
 
The Board found in its 2002 decision that the respondent had ample opportunity but did not provide any affidavits or other evidence to establish his claim that he believed he did not have to appear on his hearing date because he was a minor and thought he could appear with his father at his hearing on a different date. The Board also held the respondent did not show anything more than a misunderstanding about the hearing date and did not show any reason for failing to appear that rose to the level of exceptional circumstances. The respondent was an adult at the time of the Board’s decision, and a reasonable person in his position would suspect fraud or error or would take reasonable steps to investigate the attorney’s suspected fraud or error. Even assuming the respondent was ignorant of the attorney’s possible fraud or error, the respondent has not shown that he made reasonable efforts to pursue relief between 2002 and 2018 when he filed his motion to reopen. Bonilla v. Lynch, 840 F.3d at 583. The respondent has not detailed any efforts to seek legal assistance between 2002 and 2018 or explained why he waited 16 years to address his 2002 removal order. Id. Thus, the respondent did not make reasonable efforts to pursue relief and did not demonstrate the diligence necessary for equitable tolling.
 
*3 To the extent that the respondent requests sua sponte reopening (Respondent’s Motion at 16-17), the circumstances of this case do not present any exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of our sua sponte authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to sua sponte reconsider or reopen proceedings is reserved for “exceptional situations” and “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”).
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

The respondent also argues in his motion that under Pereira the putative notice to appear did not interrupt his period of continuous physical presence required to qualify for cancellation of removal, and the proceedings should be reopened to allow him to apply for such relief. However, in light of our finding that the respondent has not exercised the due diligence necessary for equitable tolling of the filing deadline and has not shown that the in absentia order of removal should be rescinded, we need not reach this issue.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Karla Patricia Avelino, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kimberly Daniels-Stemley
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 10, 2018, denying his motion to reconsider the September 4, 2018, denial of his motion to reopen an in absentia order of removal. While his appeal was pending, the respondent filed a motion to remand to allow him to apply for adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion to remand. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded.
 
This Board must defer to the Immigration Judge’s factual findings, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, unless they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
A motion to reconsider will only succeed if it identifies an error of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s prior decision. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b).
 
The procedural posture of the respondent’s appeal is as follows. After the respondent failed to appear for a December 11, 2008, hearing, an Immigration Judge ordered him removed in absentia (Exhs. 2, 4). On May 14, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order, which was granted by the Immigration Judge on June 7, 2010 (Exhs. 5, 7). After previous counsel withdrew from representation, the respondent appeared pro se at a February 10, 2012, hearing. He was given a continuance until July 13, 2013, to retain counsel. The Immigration Court changed the date of the hearing to January 11, 2013, and mailed a Notice of Hearing (NOH) to the address confirmed by the respondent at the February 10, 2012, hearing.
 
The respondent failed to appear at the January 11, 2013, hearing, and the court entered an in absentia removal order. On July 18, 2018, the respondent filed a motion to reopen based on his assertion that he failed to appear for the hearing because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing. On September 4, 2018, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent filed a motion to reconsider that decision, which the Immigration Judge denied on October 10, 2018. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reconsider.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen on several bases, including inter alia that, even if the respondent had rebutted the weaker presumption of delivery of a NOH sent through regular mail, the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in redressing the situation following the discovery of his in absentia order, thereby failing to show he is entitled to equitable tolling (9/4/18 IJ at 2). In particular, the Immigration Judge relied upon the respondent’s acknowledgment in his motion to reopen that he discovered that he had missed his hearing and was ordered removed in July 2013, yet he failed to file his motion to reopen his in absentia removal order until 2018 (Id.).
 
*2 We find it necessary to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for a proper analysis under Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008), as to whether the NOH was properly received by the respondent. In her September 4, 2018, denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge, after assuming that the delivery presumption had been rebutted under the factors outlined in Matter of M-R-A-, incorrectly imposed an additional due diligence requirement in concluding that the respondent failed to establish a basis for equitable tolling. However, under the case law of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in which these proceedings occurred, equitable tolling and due diligence analysis is not a ground for denying motions to reopen for lack of notice since by statute there is no time deadline for such motions. See Andia v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 1181, 1184 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that motion to reopen an in absentia hearing based on lack of notice can be made at any time and may not be denied for lack of due diligence); sections 240(b)(5)(C), (c)(7)(C)(iii) of the Act. However, under Matter of M-R-A-, lack of due diligence can be considered as a factor among others in determining whether the presumption of delivery has been rebutted. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 674 (“In determining whether a respondent has rebutted the weaker presumption of delivery applicable in these circumstances, an Immigration Judge may consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the following: (1) the respondent’s affidavit; (2) affidavits from family members or other individuals who are knowledgeable about the facts relevant to whether notice was received; (3) the respondent’s actions upon learning of the in absentia order, and whether due diligence was exercised in seeking to redress the situation; (4) any prior application for relief, indicating that the respondent had an incentive to appear; (5) any prior application for relief filed with the Immigration Court or any prima facie evidence in the record or the respondent’s motion of statutory eligibility for relief, indicating that the respondent had an incentive to appear; (6) the respondent’s previous attendance at Immigration Court hearings, if applicable; and (7) any other circumstances or evidence indicating possible nonreceipt of notice.”). Based on the foregoing, we will sustain the appeal and remand the record to the Immigration Judge to evaluate the respondent’s motion to reopen his in absentia removal order under the framework of Matter of M-R-A-.1
 
The following orders will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

IN RE: IVAN RODRIGUEZ LUEVANO
File: AXXX-XX0-619 - Dallas, TX
May 24, 2019
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lorena S. Rivas, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion requesting that the Board reconsider our August 15, 2018, decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen his order of removal in absentia. See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to the motion. The motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must identify an error of fact or law in the decision for which reconsideration is being requested. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). The respondent argues that the Board erred in affirming the decision of the Immigration Judge because his failure to appear in court was due to exceptional circumstances (Respondent’s Mot. to Reconsider at 5-7). Specifically, the respondent argues that he did not receive proper notice of his removal hearings because the DHS served him with an invalid Notice to Appear (“NTA”) pursuant to Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018), because it did not specify the date or time of his removal proceedings (Respondent’s Mot. to Reconsider at 5-7).
 
The respondent also argues that he made a good faith attempt to update the Immigration Court with his new address by notifying his prior attorney, and that his prior attorney’s failure to update the Immigration Court constitutes an exceptional circumstance warranting reopening (Respondent’s Mot. to Reconsider at 7-9). Finally, the respondent argues that because he made “all reasonable attempts to update his address with the Immigration Court, his in absentia order contravenes the Constitutional requirement of due process.” (Respondent’s Mot. to Reconsider at 10).
 
As a threshold issue, an NTA that does not specify the time and place of an applicant’s initial removal hearing vests an Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over the removal proceedings and meets the requirements of section 239(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a), so long as a notice of hearing specifying this information is later sent to the applicant. Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441 (BIA 2018). The respondent argues that his case is distinguishable from the circumstance outlined in Matter of Bermudez-Cota because he never received notice of his removal hearing and he does not seek termination of his removal proceedings (Respondent’s Mot. to Reconsider at 5-7).
 
*2 In this case, a hearing notice was sent to the address on file with the Immigration Court on September 23, 2016, specifying the date and time of the respondent’s removal proceedings. Thus, the NTA in this case was not defective and jurisdiction vested with the Immigration Judge, and the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia order of removal. See id. at 446-47.
 
Moreover, the respondent did not file a Form EOIR-33 to report his correct address with the Immigration Court, even though the NTA, which was personally served on the respondent, provided the required warnings and consequences of his failure to attend any future hearings, as well as his obligation to notify the Immigration Court of his address and the consequences of failing to do so (Exh. 1). Thus, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia order of removal. See section 240(b)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5); Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674-75 (BIA 2008) (stating that an applicant must comply with the statutory responsibility to provide current address information under section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(F), in order to prevail on a motion to reopen or rescind an in absentia order of removal); see also Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d 354 (5th Cir. 2009).
 
In addition, the Immigration Judge found that the prior attorney who the respondent claimed provided ineffective assistance of counsel by not updating the respondent’s address with the Immigration Court did not represent the respondent in his immigration proceedings and was not informed of the respondent’s address change (IJ at 2-3). The respondent does not identify any error in this determination, which is not clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (the Board reviews findings of fact for clear error); see also Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985) (holding that ““[w]here there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.”). Thus, because the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen on this basis, the respondent has not identified any error of fact or law in the Board’s affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Finally, as discussed above, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, although the respondent argues on appeal that he exercised “all reasonable attempts to update his address with the Immigration Court,” there is no indication in the record that he attempted to file a change of address form himself with the Immigration Court (Respondent’s Mot. to Reconsider at 10). See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (holding that statements of counsel are not evidence). Thus, the respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge’s decision violated his due process rights. See Ka Fung Chan v. INS, 634 F.2d 248, 258 (5th Cir. 1981) (finding no due process violation when the applicant could not establish prejudice resulting from the claimed error).
 
*3 In sum, the respondent has not identified an error of fact or law in our previous decision in this case such that it merits reconsideration. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). Accordingly, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Cecily E. Clements, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; stay of removal
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on July 18, 2011, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s August 12, 2009, decision denying a motion to suppress evidence.1 The respondent has filed a motion to reopen based on the ineffective assistance of former counsel and to pursue special rule cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(2)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(2)(A), a form of relief for certain victims of domestic violence under provisions of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). The record before us does not contain a brief in opposition from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The motion to reopen will be granted.
 
Given the facts and circumstances presented in this case, including the lack of opposition from DHS, we find an exceptional situation warranting sua sponte reopening so the respondent has an opportunity to pursue an application for special rule cancellation of removal under VAWA (see Motion to Reopen, Attachments A-W). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). In particular, the respondent’s detailed affidavit and other evidence indicate that she was not advised of her potential eligibility for relief under VAWA and suffered abuse from her U.S. citizen husband (see Motion to Reopen at 4-12, Attachments A, O-P). See Bhasin v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 977, 987 (9th Cir. 2005) (stating that facts presented in affidavits must be accepted as true unless inherently unbelievable).2
 
Consequently, we will reopen these proceedings sua sponte and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. On remand, the parties may submit additional arguments and evidence regarding the respondent’s application (or applications) for relief. Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision, and for the entry of a new decision.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The stay of removal is denied as moot.

In the proceedings below, the respondent pursued a motion to suppress along with other members of her family (AXXX-XXX-XXX, AXXX-XXX-XXX, AXXX-XXX-XXX). The respondent’s family members are not a party to the instant motion to reopen.

2

Although we conclude that sua sponte reopening is warranted in this case based on the submitted evidence and the circuit in which this cases arises, we recognize that the respondent’s former counsel has provided a robust, written reply to the ineffective assistance of counsel allegations (Response of Former Counsel, Exhs. A-H; Supplemental Response of Former Counsel).

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Adam L. Crayk, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Adam N. Greenway
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; administrative closure; remand; adjustment of status
 
*1 In a decision dated February 22, 2018, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States after denying his request for a continuance or administrative closure of proceedings. The respondent now appeals from that decision and also moves to remand the record for a new hearing based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his former lawyer. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion to remand will be denied.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, was granted U nonimmigrant status by the DHS in 2014. Sections 101(a)(15)(U) and 214(p) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(U), 1184(p) (2012). However, in 2017 he was convicted in Utah of possessing a controlled substance with intent to distribute, a felony. UTAH CODE ANN. § 58-37-8(1)(a)(iii) (West 2017). Based on that conviction, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) charged him with being removable as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation (Exh. 1). Section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). He conceded that charge below, through counsel (IJ at 1-2; Tr. at 6).
 
The respondent did not apply for relief from removal before the Immigration Judge. Instead, he moved to continue his proceedings so that he could apply for adjustment of status under section 245(m) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(m), before United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), a component of the DHS (Exh. 3). The Immigration Judge denied the motion, however, finding no “good cause” for a continuance in light of the serious adverse discretionary factors militating against the respondent’s claim for adjustment of status (IJ at 2-4). 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6 (2018); Matter of L-A-B-R- et al., 27 I&N Dec. 405 (A.G. 2018).
 
In his appeal brief, the respondent does not challenge the Immigration Judge’s description of his offense conduct or otherwise dispute the judge’s assessment of the discretionary factors bearing on the merits of his continuance request. Instead, he argues that his former attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Br. at 4-9) and that the Immigration Judge erroneously found that his Utah drug conviction was an aggravated felony (Respondent’s Br. at 9-11). We find both arguments unpersuasive.
 
*2 The respondent’s ineffective assistance claim is based on former counsel’s alleged failure to file an application for section 245(m) adjustment on his behalf with the Immigration Judge (Respondent’s Br. at 6-8). This omission did not reflect deficient performance of former counsel’s duties, however, because the Immigration Judge would have had no jurisdiction to adjudicate such an application had it been filed. The Act and regulations make clear that jurisdiction over applications for section 245(m) adjustment lies solely with USCIS; Immigration Judges can neither adjudicate such applications in the first instance nor review DHS decisions denying them. See section 245(m)(1) of the Act (granting adjustment authority to “the Secretary of Homeland Security”); 8 C.F.R. § 245.24(k) (“USCIS shall have exclusive jurisdiction over adjustment applications filed under section 245(m) of the Act”). In sum, as the Immigration Judge could not have adjudicated the respondent’s application for section 245(m) adjustment, former counsel’s ““failure” to file such an application was not ineffective assistance.
 
The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge mistakenly found him ineligible for section 245(m) adjustment by describing his Utah drug offense as an “aggravated felony” (Respondent’s Br. at 9-11). However, that argument mischaracterizes the Immigration Judge’s decision. In assessing whether the respondent had established “good cause” for a continuance, the Immigration Judge stated that he viewed the respondent’s “criminal behavior” as “an aggravated felony, distribution of a controlled substance....” (IJ at 3). We consider this passing statement to have been an expression of the judge’s opinion about the respondent’s conduct, not an announcement of a formal legal conclusion about the elements of his offense.
 
Also, the Immigration Judge did not state that an aggravated felony conviction would render the respondent “ineligible” for section 245(m) adjustment. Rather, the Immigration Judge properly determined that the nature and recency of the respondent’s criminal offense made him a poor candidate for a continuance because it diminished his chances of being granted adjustment of status in discretion. Matter of L-A-B-R- et al., 27 I&N Dec. at 418 (holding that an Immigration Judge may deny a continuance if she decides that the underlying relief is unlikely to be granted in discretion); see also Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 790 (BIA 2009) (listing “whether the respondent’s application ... merits a favorable exercise of discretion” as a relevant factor when evaluating a continuance request). Even if we assume that the respondent’s offense of conviction is not a categorical aggravated felony (a question we need not decide), we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the offense justified the denial of his continuance request.
 
*3 In light of the foregoing, we will dismiss the respondent’s appeal and deny his motion to remand.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joshua E. Bardavid, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 On June 4, 2018, the respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, submitted a motion to reopen proceedings in which the Board dismissed her appeal on August 24, 2006. She also seeks a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
The respondent’s motion is statutorily barred as untimely because it was filed more than 11 years after the Board’s final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). However, the respondent asks that the Board sua sponte reopen proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). In this regard, she avers that the criminal convictions which formed the basis for the charges of removal have been vacated pursuant to New York Criminal Procedure Law section 440.10 on the basis of legal and constitutional defect, and that she has instead plead to criminal trespass under New York Penal Law section 140.10.
 
In support of her motion to reopen, the respondent has submitted copies of the Motion to Vacate Conviction she submitted to the state court, which was based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as well as current certificates of disposition regarding her convictions (Motion, Tabs B, D). She has provided evidence relating to her rehabilitation, her family, and other related documents. The respondent contends that she is now, therefore, eligible to pursue cancellation of removal. Matter of Rodriguez-Ruiz, 22 I&N Dec. 1378 (BIA 2000)
 
Given the record presented, we find it appropriate to grant sua sponte reopening. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). On remand the respondent bears the burden of establishing that the convictions at issue were vacated on the basis of a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings, and not because of post-conviction events. Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621, 624 (BIA 2003); see also Saleh v. Gonzales, 495 F.3d 17 (2d Cir. 2007). Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gail A. Dulay, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Adam E. Mattei
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on May 9, 2018, when we denied the respondent’s untimely and number-barred motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. On June 7, 2018, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider requesting the Board reconsider its decision denying his motion to reopen.1 The motion is also in the nature of another untimely and number-barred motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief in opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
We first address that aspect of the motion requesting reconsideration. A motion to reconsider shall specify “errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). The respondent’s motion establishes no error in our determination that he did not establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and did not warrant sua sponte reopening. The respondent reiterates the arguments raised in his previous motion to the Board. We considered those arguments and found them unpersuasive when viewed within the record as a whole before we denied his motion to reopen. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. at 58 (stating that “a motion to reconsider is not a process by which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief presented on appeal . . .”). Disagreement with the result is not sufficient. Therefore, the motion to reconsider is denied.
 
As a motion to reopen, it is untimely and number barred, as it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s February 22, 2013, final order dismissing his appeal, and it is not the respondent’s first motion to reopen. Sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent continues to assert that equitable tolling of the time and number limits on his motion to reopen is warranted based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and seeks to submit evidence that he has now complied with the requirements laid out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Even assuming that the respondent has now properly complied with the Lozada requirements, he still has not established prejudice from prior counsel’s actions or inactions. See Jiang v. Mukasey, 522 F.3d 266, 270 (2d Cir. 2008) (stating that to succeed on a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance an applicant must show, inter alia, “that the applicant was prejudiced by his counsel’s performance.”). The immediate relative visa petition (Form I-130) that was filed on the respondent’s behalf by his second United States citizen spouse was not approved by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) until months after the Board’s February 2013 final decision on the merits. Thus, it is speculative that a motion to remand would have been granted, especially given the procedural history of this case, i.e. the respondent previously attempted to adjust his status based on a prior marriage to a different United States citizen who failed to appear for the respondent’s hearing. Consequently, the respondent has not demonstrated that the ultimate outcome might have been affected by his prior counsels. Thus, the motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred, and the respondent has not shown prejudice to warrant equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Finally, we decline to exercise our discretion to reopen proceedings sua sponte because the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). Having considered the record in its entirety and do not find present an exceptional circumstance sufficient to warrant the exercise of our sua sponte authority.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.2
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
George E. Crimarco, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; stay of removal
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on June 25, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s November 13, 2007, decision denying her motion to reconsider the denial of a motion reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel.1 The respondent has filed a motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia, and to pursue adjustment of status based on an approved Form I-130 petition. The record before us does not contain a brief in opposition from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The respondent also requests a stay of removal. The motion to reopen will be granted, the removal order will be rescinded, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
Considering the facts and circumstances presented in the respondent’s motion, which has not been opposed by DHS, we conclude that reopening is warranted under Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001). See also Matter of Anyelo, 25 I&N Dec. 337 (BIA 2010) (distinguishing Dominguez v. United States Att’y Gen., 284 F.3d 1258 (11th Cir. 2002), and concluding that the holding in Matter of G-Y-R- as to the notice required to authorize the entry of an in absentia order, is applicable to cases arising in the Eleventh Circuit). In Matter of G-Y-R-, we held that entry of an in absentia order of removal is inappropriate where the record reflects that the alien did not receive, and could not be charged with receiving, the Notice to Appear (NTA) that was served by mail at an address obtained from documents filed with the Service several years earlier. We concluded that section 239(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1), authorizes the entry of an in absentia order only after the respondent receives the warnings and advisals contained in the NTA.
 
In the instant motion to reopen and throughout these proceedings, the respondent has claimed that she never received the NTA or the Notice of Hearing (NOH) because they were mailed to an old address (Motion to Reopen at 1-3). In support of the motion, the respondent has submitted, inter alia, an affidavit and a change of address form reflecting an updated address (Motion to Reopen, Exhs. A, D). Consequently, we conclude that reopening and rescission of the in absentia removal order is warranted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. On remand, the respondent should have the opportunity to apply for adjustment of status or other relief for which she may be eligible. Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the April 10, 2007, in absentia removal order is rescinded.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision, and for the entry of a new decision.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Judy S. Resnick, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal on November 20, 2018, and he filed a timely motion to reopen on December 7, 2018. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. We will reopen the proceedings, and remand the case to the Immigration Court.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Latvia, was found subject to removal as an aggravated felon, and as having violated a state law relating to a controlled substance violation. This was based on his being convicted in New Jersey in 2011 of an offense involving heroin.
 
The respondent contends in his motion that his conviction has been vacated, and he seeks to have the removal proceedings terminated. He offers a December 5, 2018, order from the criminal court, which indicates that a request to withdraw his guilty plea was granted. The order also states, however, that the motion for post-conviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel was denied.
 
A conviction vacated on the merits - because of legal or constitutional defect, including the failure to advise the defendant of the immigration consequences of his plea - is not a conviction for immigration purposes. However, a conviction vacated solely because of its immigration consequences remains a conviction for immigration purposes. See Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006); Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). See also Matter of Marquez Conde, 27 I&N Dec. 251, 255 (BIA 2018) (modifying the decision in Pickering to give it nationwide application); Matter of J.M. Acosta, 27 I&N Dec. 420, 428-29 (BIA 2018).
 
We will therefore remand the record to the Immigration Judge to enable the judge to determine the basis under which the conviction was vacated, and for further action, as appropriate. Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John P. Leschak, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sean Gorman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the April 4, 2018, decision of the Immigration Judge denying his motion to reopen the proceedings sua sponte and based on changed country conditions. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not file an opposition to the appeal. During the course of the appeal, the respondent has filed two motions to remand the record based on Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018), and Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441 (BIA 2018). The DHS has opposed the respondent’s first motion. The motions will be denied. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent filed a motion with the Immigration Judge on March 27, 2018. In that motion the respondent argued, inter alia, that sua sponte reopening was required because the in absentia order of removal, entered on April 13, 2010, was legally invalid, as the Immigration Judge had improperly reopened previously terminated proceedings. The respondent argued that the Immigration Judge was precluded from issuing an in absentia removal order because the DHS had not issued a new Notice to Appear. The Immigration Judge rejected this argument, noting that proceedings had been terminated without prejudice.
 
On appeal, the respondent makes no persuasive argument that the Immigration Judge’s determination that proceedings had been previously terminated without prejudice is incorrect. Furthermore, the respondent does not cite to any relevant precedent which supports his claim that the Immigration Judge was precluded from entertaining a motion to reopen proceedings, and that the only avenue for the Immigration Judge to acquire jurisdiction would have been the issuance of a new Notice to Appear.
 
The respondent also argued that the in absentia order of removal should be rescinded, and proceedings reopened, based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent did not contend, as a basis for excusing the lack of timely filing of the motion, that he did not receive notice of the April 13, 2010, hearing. Rather he claimed exceptional circumstances. However, to the extent the respondent’s motion was based on exceptional circumstances, it was untimely, as such a motion must be filed within 180 days of the order, unless that period is equitably tolled. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent did not establish that he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. In fact, the respondent conceded that previous counsel has attempted to contact him multiple times. The Immigration Judge rejected the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim as a basis for reopening, and concluded that the respondent did not exercise due diligence, such as to warrant equitable tolling.
 
*2 It is uncontested that the DHS had issued a Notice to Appear on November 1, 2005, but on December 14, 2006, the Immigration Judge terminated proceedings to allow the respondent to pursue adjustment of status. Adjustment of status was denied on February 10, 2009. After proceedings were reopened, respondent’s counsel, Ms. Rondon, appeared for the respondent at the reopened proceedings, on March 11, 2010, but the respondent did not appear and a continuance was granted. Ms. Rondon made several attempts to contact the respondent both prior to this hearing and subsequently. Ms. Rondon appeared again on behalf of the respondent on April 13, 2010, but the respondent did not appear and was ordered removed in absentia.
 
The respondent claims that his mother contacted another attorney, Ms. Quiroz, in March of 2010, but was informed to wait for notice of a court date, and no mention was made of the March 11, or April 13, 2010, dates. The respondent does not fully explain whether or not he had any contact with Ms. Rondon during this time. The respondent received the in absentia order dated April 13, 2010. The respondent’s mother claims she contacted Ms. Quiroz immediately and was informed a motion to reopen would need to be filed. The mother then paid an additional fee and was provided what she claims was a copy of the motion to reopen she believed was filed by Ms. Quiroz (Motion to Reopen at 5-6, citing Tab E). The mother was informed by Ms. Quiroz to simply wait for a decision on the motion to reopen. Ms. Quiroz disputes this account.
 
On March 14, 2018, the respondent was detained and his mother contacted Ms. Quiroz. She also contacted a new attorney, John Leschak, who is the respondent’s current attorney of record. Mr. Leschak learned that no motion to reopen had been filed by Ms. Quiroz, and Mr. Leschak filed the current motion to reopen proceedings, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of Quiroz, and arguing changed country conditions in El Salvador (Motion to Reopen at 7-19). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s rejection of the equitable tolling and ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We observe that the Immigration Judge specifically found that the respondent’s former attorney, Ms. Rondon, made several attempts to contact the respondent prior to the in absentia order. He found the respondent lacked due diligence, as he waited approximately 9 years before attempting to explain this lack of contact (IJ at 1). He then found that because of this lack of due diligence, the respondent had not shown any prejudice by the later acts of Ms. Quiroz (id.).
 
We acknowledge that the respondent attempted to establish in his motion that he was misinformed by Ms. Quiroz that the motion had been filed. This argument is made less persuasive by the declaration of Ms. Quiroz, in which she plainly states that the respondent did not make himself available to her and that the relevant contacts were through his mother (the respondent was an adult at the time). Furthermore, Ms. Quiroz plainly states that the payment receipts were likely for partial payment, that the draft of the motion was likely prepared for review before full payment, and that full payment was probably not made. Ms. Quiroz explained in detail the practices of her office. While we have no reason not to credit the sincerity of the statement of the respondent’s mother that she was informed that the motion had been filed, the respondent has not established that it is more likely that the declaration of Ms. Quiroz contains materially false statements than that his mother misunderstood the communications from Ms. Quiroz. We have taken into consideration the documentary corroboration of the respondent’s mother’s account - a copy of an unfiled motion and unannotated receipts - but that corroboration is not inconsistent with the statement of Ms. Quiroz.
 
*3 While, due to the passage of time, and due to the respondent’s continuous lack of personal cooperation with his attorneys, there is no record of the respondent’s state of knowledge regarding his removal proceedings, it seems clear that the respondent did not exercise the normal due diligence that an alien in removal proceedings should exercise. This is even more the case because the respondent had engaged in criminal activities, and had - according to the reasonable inferences that the Immigration Judge drew from the record - ignored his responsibility to take reasonable measures to attend his scheduled hearing. Furthermore, the respondent allowed 9 years to pass, after being ordered removed, before he took any significant steps to contact immigration authorities directly about his status, and he did not, in fact, take such steps until he had been detained. Upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge that due diligence was not shown.
 
The respondent also argued that proceedings should be reopened based on changed country conditions in El Salvador, with respect to the treatment of former gang members in that country. The Immigration Judge did not address this issue.
 
There is no time limit on the filing of a motion to reopen if the basis of the motion is to apply for asylum or withholding of removal and it is based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality, if the evidence offered in support of the motion is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). If an alien has been ordered removed in absentia, there is no requirement that the in absentia removal order be rescinded. See Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013). To the extent that the respondent contends that his motion should be granted because of changed country conditions, we conclude that the provided evidence does not establish materially changed conditions in El Salvador.
 
The respondent submitted three copies of newspaper articles which provided information and analysis on such subjects as violence in El Salvador and the relationship between the government and violent gangs, such as the gang to which the respondent used to belong, and three charts detailing homicide rates in El Salvador in recent years (Respondent’s Br. Exh. B, 3-11, Respondent’s Motion, Exh. T, 104-112). The evidence submitted with the respondent’s motion is insufficient to demonstrate that country conditions in El Salvador have materially changed since the time of his last hearing. A material change is not simply an incremental variation in general conditions of violence, but rather a change with a material effect on a respondent’s potential of being persecuted in the relevant county. The evidence which the respondent relies on for his claim of a material change does not amount to more than incremental variations in the government and society’s attitudes to crime and to former gang members. A continuation of the conditions that existed at the time of the respondent’s last hearing does not constitute a material change, such as to warrant reopening of these proceedings.1 Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247, 257 (BIA 2007). As such, the respondent’s motion to reopen based on changed circumstances will be denied.
 
*4 The respondent, on August 20, 2018, filed a motion in which he argued that the NTA, issued on November 1, 2005, (Exh. 1) was defective for purposes of placing him in proceedings, citing the Supreme Court’s ruling in Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. at 2114-16 (holding that an NTA that does not designate a specific time and place of an alien’s removal proceedings does not trigger the Act’s stop-time rule ending his period of continuous presence in the United States for purposes of section 240A(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)). In Pereira v. Sessions, the Supreme Court held that the stop-time rule was not triggered by a notice to appear that failed to identify the date and time for the hearing. This holding does not require or compel termination of proceedings. A notice to appear that does not specify the date and time of the alien’s initial removal hearing vests an Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over the removal proceedings, and meets the requirements of section 239(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1) when a notice of hearing specifying this information is later sent to the alien. Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. at 445-47. See also Karingithi v. Whitaker, 913 F.3d 1158 (9th Cir. 2019); Hernandez-Perez v. Whitaker, 911 F.3d 305, 312-16 (6th Cir. 2018). The record reflects that notice was properly sent to the respondent, on August 3, 2006. Moreover, the respondent did not object to the notice to appear before the Immigration Judge thus waiving any claim with respect to the notice to appear. Therefore, we disagree with the respondent’s contentions regarding subject matter jurisdiction.
 
On September 21, 2018, the respondent filed another motion to the Board. This motion was filed after the issuance of Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. at 441, and the respondent argued that he is eligible for cancellation of removal as the incomplete NTA did not end his continuous physical presence under the holding in Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. at 2105 (Motion to Remand, Sept. 21, 2018, at 5-6). This motion will be denied because, in Matter of Oparah, 23 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 2000), we held that a motion to remand filed during the pendency of an the appeal of an Immigration Judge’s denial of a motion to reopen is not excepted from the numerical restriction that permits the filing of only one motion to reopen. Even if not number barred, the motion is without merit because the respondent is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal. An alien who has been subject to an in absentia order of removal is, with certain exceptions not applicable here, ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A of the Act for a period of 10 years following the final order of removal. See section 240(b)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(7).
 
*5 Finally, we decline the respondent’s request to exercise our sua sponte reopening authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Sua sponte authority is invoked sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The respondent has not demonstrated the presence of such exceptional circumstances.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motions to remand are denied.

While the Immigration Judge did not address the issue, we review, under the circumstances of this case, the issue of whether the evidence submitted would warrant reopening under a de novo standard. Hence, while we acknowledge the respondent’s statement that the Immigration Judge should have addressed the issue, the respondent cannot demonstrate prejudice from the Immigration Judge’s lack of analysis of this issue.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael A. Areizaga, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 On September 26, 2018, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider and/or reopen after the Board, on August 27, 2018, denied her untimely motion to reopen. The Board had dismissed her appeal on August 25, 2009. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of a decision based upon the previous factual record, whereas a motion to reopen seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57-58 (BIA 2006); sections 240(c)(6), (7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6), (7); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(b), (c). A party seeking reconsideration requests a decision be reexamined in light of alleged legal or factual errors, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. Id.; Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991).
 
The respondent challenges the Board’s finding, in our August 27, 2018, decision, that reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was not warranted as she did not exercise due diligence in pursuing her claim. She essentially contends that she was not aware that she could pursue adjustment of status and a waiver of inadmissibility because her attorney did not advise her of this fact (Motion at 5; 2/26/18 MTR, Tab A, para. 14). However, this does not refute the fact that the respondent was present at the two separate hearings where her potential eligibility for a visa petition, adjustment of status, and a waiver of inadmissibility were extensively discussed (Tr. at 184-87, 191-211). The issue of her eligibility for such relief was also raised on appeal, and she has not alleged ignorance of this fact. As such, we find no merit to her assertion that she discovered her former counsel’s ineffectiveness only after speaking with her current counsel. Moreover, we find no error in our determination that she did not show prejudice as she failed to demonstrate that she warranted a favorable exercise of discretion for purposes of adjustment and the noted waiver in light of her extended history of providing falsehoods to United States authorities. As such, reconsideration is not warranted.
 
To the extent that the respondent seeks to introduce evidence for the Board’s consideration, this aspect of her motion is in the nature of one seeking reopening. INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). As she has filed prior motions to reopen, and since this motion was filed more than 8 years after the Board’s final administrative decision, it is statutorily both time and number-barred. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent asks that this evidence, relating to her spouse’s medical issues, be considered in conjunction with her prior motion to reopen for reexamination of her equities and evidence of rehabilitation to support a favorable finding with respect to discretion (Motion at 6).
 
*2 However, the respondent has not explained how medical evidence pertaining to her husband relates to a showing of rehabilitation on her part, or would otherwise warrant granting this untimely motion. This evidence also has no bearing on whether she has demonstrated that her proceedings should be reopened based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Absent such a showing, reopening is not warranted.
 
In sum, neither reopening of the proceedings nor reconsideration of the Board’s prior decision is appropriate. As such, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

File: AXXX-XX9-146 - Miami, FL

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David A. Silk, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on May 28, 2009, at which time we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings for ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has now filed an untimely and number barred motion to reopen on June 14, 2018. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be granted.
 
On August 11, 2008, this Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s December 21, 2006, decision finding the respondent removable under section 237(a)(2)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), for having been convicted of a crime of domestic violence, and under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), for having been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude.1 Regarding the respondent’s removability under section 237(a)(2)(E)(i) of the Act, the respondent was charged with, and pled guilty to, simple battery under Fla. Stat.§ 784.03(1). In a lodged charge, the DHS also charged the respondent with having been convicted in the Palm Beach County Circuit Court for the offense of Burglary of a Conveyance and Grand Theft Auto, in violation of Florida Statutes section 810.02(a) and 812.014(1), (2).
 
In his motion, the respondent argues that due to fundamental, intervening case law, he is no longer removable under sections 237(a)(2)(E)(i) and (a)(1)(A) of the Act, and he has submitted various copies of statutes and case law in support of his argument. We agree. Based on intervening case law, the respondent is no longer removable under section 237(a)(2)(E)(i) of the Act, for having been convicted of domestic violence. Moreover, while the respondent does not address his theft conviction, we agree that under current case law he has not been convicted of a second crime involving moral turpitude for purposes of section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act.
 
We first address the respondent’s simple battery conviction under Fla. Stat.§ 784.03(1), and his resulting removability under section 237(a)(2)(E)(i) of the Act. We conclude that this statute is not a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. § 16(a) because it does not include as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of violent physical force against the person or property of another. Under Florida law, a battery occurs when a person either (1) “actually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against (his) will” or (2) “intentionally causes bodily harm to another person”. See Fla. Stat. § 784.03(1)(a). In Johnson v. United States, 130 S.Ct. 1265 (2010), the Supreme Court found that mere offensive touching under Fla. Stat. § 784.03(1) does not constitute a crime of violence because it does not have, as an element, the use of physical force. Moreover, Florida courts have repeatedly held that violating Florida’s battery statute does not require the use of physical force. See Perkins v. State, 576 So.2d 1310 (Fla. 1991); State v. Reams, 961 So.2d 211 (Fla. 2007); Bradley v. State, 106 So. 3d 530, 532 (Fla. App. Ct. 2013); Santiago v. State, 76 So.3d 1027 (Fla. App. Ct. 2011). Lastly, the Board held, in Matter of Guzman-Polanco, 26 I&N Dec. 713 (BIA 2016), that under 18 U.S.C. § 16(a), a statute that requires that the defendant intentionally inflict injury to a victim does not necessarily involve the use of violent physical force as required under Johnson v. United States, because an intentional act that results in injury to the victim can be accomplished in multiple ways that do not involve the intentional use of violent physical force.
 
*2 Similarly, we find that the respondent is no longer removable for having been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude under section section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act. “Moral turpitude” generally refers to conduct that is “[i]nherently base, vile, or depraved, and contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general.” See Matter of Ortega-Lopez, 26 I&N Dec. 99, 100 (BIA 2013). For a crime to involve moral turpitude, it must involve reprehensible conduct and a culpable mental state. See Matter of Ortega-Lopez, 26 I&N Dec. at 99; see also Matter of Silva-Trevino, 26 I&N Dec. 826, 834 (BIA 2016)1 (Silva-Trevino III) (“to involve moral turpitude, a crime requires two essential elements: reprehensible conduct and a culpable mental state”).
 
In determining whether a crime involves moral turpitude, the categorical approach is first applied in order to examine if there is a “realistic probability,” not a “theoretical possibility” that the criminal statute at issue would be applied to reach conduct that does not involve moral turpitude. See Matter of Louissaint, 24 I&N Dec. 754, 757 (BIA 2009); see also Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. 183, 192 (2007); Matter of Cortes Medina, 26 I&N Dec. 79, 82 (BIA 2013).
 
In his 2007 decision, the Immigration Judge acknowledged that the respondent had a lengthy criminal record, including a series of arrests as well as the convictions as charged on his Notice to Appear (IJ at 6-9). However, the respondent’s convictions at issue include resisting arrest without violence under Fla. Statutes § 843.02, disorderly conduct under Fla. Stat. § 877.03, and, as discussed above, simple battery under Fla. Stat. 784.03.
 
The crimes of assault and battery include a broad spectrum of misconduct, ranging from relatively minor offenses such as simple assault to serious offenses such as assault with a deadly weapon. See Matter of Fualaau, 21 I&N Dec. 475, 477 (BIA 1996); Matter of Danesh, 19 I&N Dec. 669, 670 (BIA 1988). We have held that assault and battery offenses may or may not involve moral turpitude. See Matter of Solon, 24 I&N Dec. 239, 241 (BIA 2007); Matter of Danesh, 19 I&N Dec. at 670. To find moral turpitude, a statute must require a sufficient level of intent by the perpetrator and a sufficient level of harm to the victim. See Matter of Solon, 24 I&N Dec. at 242; Matter of Perez-Contreras, 20 I&N Dec. 615, 618-19 (BIA 1992).
 
*3 Simple assault crimes generally are not considered to be crimes involving moral turpitude because they may involve mere touching. See Matter of Perez-Contreras, 20 I&N Dec. at 618; Matter of Short, 20 I&N Dec. 136, 139 (BIA 1989). The statute under which the respondent was convicted, Florida Statute § 784.03, provides: “The offense of battery occurs when a person (1) actually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against the will of the other; or (2) intentionally causes bodily harm to another person.” As such, because the statute reaches conduct involving mere touching, Fla. Stat. § 784.03 does not meet the definition of a categorical crime involving moral turpitude. See Matter of Garcia-Hernandez, 23 I&N Dec. 590 (BIA 2003); Matter of Fualaau, 21 I&N Dec. 475 (BIA 1996).
 
Similarly, resisting arrest without violence under Fla. Statutes § 843.02 and disorderly conduct under Fla. Stat. § 877.03 do not categorically involve moral turpitude. The disorderly conduct statute proscribes any acts which “corrupt the public moral, or outrage the sense of public decency, or affect the peace and quiet of persons who may witness them ....” As the respondent argues in his motion, “affecting the peace and quiet of witnesses,” which is the minimum criminal conduct necessary under the statute, requires neither the requisite reprehensible conduct nor culpable mental state to qualify as a crime involving moral turpitude. See generally Matter of Khourn, 21 I&N Dec. 1041 (BIA 1997); Matter of Abreu-Semino, 12 I&N Dec. 775, 777 (BIA 1968) (finding that crimes in which evil intent is not an element, no matter how serious the act or harmful the consequences, do not involve moral turpitude”).
 
Lastly, the statute for resisting arrest, under Fla. Stat. § 843.02, states, in pertinent part, that “whoever shall resist, obstruct, or oppose any officer ... or other person legally authorized to execute process in the execution of legal process ... without offering or doing violence to the ... officer, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor ...”. The crime of interfering with a police officer is analogous to assault, and only involves moral turpitude when it involves the use of violent physical force. See Matter of Logan, 17 I&N Dec. 367, 368 (BIA 1980). Inasmuch as Fla. Stat. § 843.02 does not require physical force, and instead reaches conduct which would constitute simple assault, it does not constitute a crime involving moral turpitude. See Matter of Ahortalejo-Guzman, 25 I&N Dec. 465, 466 (BIA 2011); Matter of Fualaau, 21 I&N Dec. at 475.
 
*4 As such, we find that the respondent is no longer removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, for having been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude. Inasmuch as the respondent is also not removable under section 237(a)(2)(E) of the Act or section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act, we will terminate the respondent’s proceedings. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted, and the proceedings are terminated without prejudice.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patrick Espinosa, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeared before an Immigration Judge on July 30, 2018, and agreed to depart the United States voluntarily under safeguards. On August 30, 2018, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, and appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 13, 2018, denying the motion. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he established in his motion to reopen that his former attorney provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel, inasmuch as counsel erred by not filing an asylum application on his behalf. He further asserts that former counsel incorrectly advised him to request that the Immigration Judge allow him to depart the United States voluntarily. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998) (stating that ineffective assistance of counsel requires that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair). However, the record contains a statement from the respondent’s former counsel wherein he states that the respondent did not provide him with evidence to support his application for asylum (Motion at F). Counsel further states that the respondent told him that he did not fear returning to Guatemala and instead wished to depart the United States voluntarily (Motion at F). The respondent disputes the veracity of former counsel’s statement (Respondent’s Br. at 6-8).
 
There is no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not establish that his former counsel denied him due process by not filing an asylum application on his behalf. The Immigration Judge found the statement of the respondent’s former counsel to be credible, and we are unable to discern clear error in that determination. Hence, it appears that the respondent chose not to apply for asylum in the United States and has not established that he is a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
In addition, we decline to reopen these proceedings sua sponte (Respondent’s Br. at 9-12). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s and the Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). The respondent, as stated, has not established that he is a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We are also unable to identify any additional circumstances to warrant the sua sponte reopening of these proceedings.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Daniela Hogue, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Chelsea Rubin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. On May 21, 2015, the Immigration Judge issued an order of removal in absentia. On October 22, 2015, and April 25, 2018, the Immigration Judge denied motions to reopen. The respondent filed a timely appeal from the Immigration Judge’s April 25, 2018, order. On May 16, 2018, the Board denied the respondent’s motion for an emergency stay and the respondent was removed on May 23, 2018. The Department of Homeland Security requests that the Board summarily affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s April 25, 2018, order denying his second motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of former counsel. The respondent contends that his former counsel apparently received notice of his hearing, but did not advise the respondent of the hearing date. The respondent also alleges that former counsel did not advise him that an in absentia order had been issued or that former counsel was filing a motion to reopen. Since former counsel did not appear at his hearing and did not notify the respondent of the hearing, the respondent contends that his failure to appear was due to ineffective assistance of former counsel.
 
Since notice to counsel is notice to the respondent, the respondent is deemed to have notice. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2). See also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). Therefore the respondent was required to file his motion to reopen within 180 days of the in absentia order of removal and demonstrate exceptional circumstances as to why he did not appear. Section 240(b)(5) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
The respondent’s first motion to reopen was timely filed, but he did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances. The respondent did not file a Notice of Appeal with respect to the Immigration Judge’s October 22, 2015, order denying the first motion to reopen.
 
*2 The respondent’s second motion, the denial of which is currently before us on appeal, was not timely filed. The respondent contends that equitable tolling of the time and number bar should apply due to ineffective assistance of former counsel. See Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 713 F.3d. 1357, 1362 n. 3, 1364-65 (11th Cir. 2013) (equitable tolling applies to in absentia orders); Montano-Cisneros v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 514 F.3d 1224 (11th Cir. 2008). The respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). There is no evidence that former counsel responded to the complaint.
 
The Immigration Judge properly declined to equitably toll the time and number bars based on ineffective assistance of counsel. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate that he pursued his rights diligently. See Avila-Santoyo v. Atty Gen., 713 F.3d. at 1363 n. 5 (11th Cir. 2013). The respondent was aware of his in absentia order of removal as of January 2016, but his second motion was not filed until April 17, 2018, about 15 months later (IJ Attachment, April 25, 2018; Motion to Reopen, Tab A at paras. 14-20, April 17, 2018).
 
Soon after becoming aware of the in absentia order of removal, the respondent discussed his case with his former lawyer and then Catholic Charities (Motion to Reopen, Tab A at paras. 14-21), but there is no evidence that he engaged his former lawyer or Catholic Charities to formally review or further pursue his case. He avers that he reached out to a couple of other lawyers but this general assertion does not demonstrate that he was diligently pursuing his rights. Further, he did not contact his current firm until February 2017, over a year after learning about the in absentia order of removal. Considering these circumstances, the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion.
 
We decline to exercise our sua sponte discretionary authority to reopen proceedings because the respondent has not demonstrated an exceptional situation justifying the exercise of our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ivan Yocub, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on March 16, 2005. On January 3, 2018, the Board upheld an Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen these proceedings to seek asylum and related relief based on changed country conditions in El Salvador. On April 3, 2018, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen. He later filed a supplemental motion to reopen, with an accompanying request for a stay of removal. The Board denied his stay request on October 2, 2018. The motion to reopen and supplemental motion, which remain pending and to which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded, will be denied.
 
The respondent asserts that reopening is warranted because he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorney who represented him on his first motion to reopen and on appeal before the Board. The respondent faults counsel for filing “a subpar motion to reopen and brief in support of appeal.” (Motion to Reopen at 1). Specifically, he argues that he was denied reopening because counsel (1) provided only minimal information regarding country conditions in El Salvador in 2005; (2) made no meaningful comparison between conditions that existed at that time and current conditions; and (3) failed to argue that evidence of changed country conditions was material to his claims for relief (Id. at 7).
 
The respondent also argues that reopening is warranted because he did not receive notice of his 2005 hearing (Motion to Reopen at 23-27). The respondent argues that his Notice to Appear was deficient because it did not provide a date and time of the hearing, and that he never received a Notice of Hearing (Id. at 26). He further contends that no immigration officer told him that he had to go to court or provide the court with an updated address (Id. at 27 & Exh. A ¶ 18). The respondent claims he was told he was “free to travel throughout the country with the papers[,], that he cannot read Spanish or English and that he had no idea what the Notice to Appear said (Id., Exh. A ¶ 18).
 
The respondent also seeks sua sponte reopening pursuant to our limited discretionary authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a) (Motion to Reopen at 1, 22).
 
In his supplemental motion to reopen, the respondent argues that proceedings should be reopened and terminated for lack of jurisdiction based on Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S.Ct. 2105 (2018) (Supplemental Motion to Reopen at 2-7). According to the respondent, Pereira establishes that his Notice to Appear was invalid because it lacked a date and time of hearing, and that, consequently, the Immigration Court never acquired jurisdiction over his proceedings. The respondent claims that service of a subsequent notice of hearing does not “cure” a deficient Notice to Appear (Id.). Finally, and in the alternative, the respondent reiterates that his proceedings should be reopened based on lack of notice (Id. at 7-9).
 
*2 To the extent the respondent seeks reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the instant motion is time and number-barred. See sections 240(c)(7)(A) and 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). Even if the motion was not so barred, the respondent is not entitled to reopening on this basis. To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a respondent must show that the claimed ineffective representation resulted in substantial prejudice. See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2008); Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006). Proving prejudice requires making a prima facie showing that the alleged violation affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Okpala v. Whitaker, 908 F.3d 965, 971 (5th Cir. 2018). The respondent has made no such showing here.
 
The respondent has not made a prima facie showing of changed country conditions in El Salvador that are material to his claim and that would render him eligible for relief. We acknowledge that the country conditions evidence proffered with the motion reflects that there has been an increase in gang violence in El Salvador since the respondent’s in absentia hearing (Motion to Reopen, Exhs. C, D). However, the respondent has not meaningfully shown that he may become a victim of such violence, or that any violence he may encounter would be on account of a protected ground under the Act.
 
The respondent fears that he will be targeted by gang members upon his repatriation based on his membership in his family because gang members threatened his nephew’s wife and her family after she refused their extortion efforts and refused to “turn over” her son to collaborate with the gang (Id. at 3, 16). The only pieces of evidence he has proffered in support of his fear, however, are his own asylum application and supporting declaration (Motion to Reopen, Exh. A). We afford limited weight to the respondent’s statements regarding his family’s experiences in El Salvador. The respondent does not appear to have firsthand knowledge of these events, which occurred years after he came to the United States (Id., Exh.A). The respondent has also offered no explanation of how he came to be aware of these events (Id.).
 
Moreover, the respondent avers that his nephew’s wife came to the United States in 2014 (Motion to Reopen, Exh. A ¶ 7). The respondent has not provided any corroborating evidence from her or from anyone else who would have had firsthand knowledge of these events. At this time and on this record, the respondent has not shown that he presently may face persecution or torture in El Salvador.1
 
*3 Based on the foregoing, we find that the respondent has failed to demonstrate substantial prejudice. We therefore find no basis to grant this untimely and number-barred motion to reopen.
 
The respondent also has not shown that he is eligible for reopening based on lack of notice of his hearing. We are satisfied that the respondent received adequate notice for the reasons articulated in our last decision.
 
We find the respondent’s argument that no one told him to come to court or to provide an address unpersuasive. His Notice to Appear provides a certification from a border patrol agent that he was given oral notice in the Spanish language of the consequences of his failure to appear for a hearing and of the need to provide the court with an address (Admin. Record, Exh. 1). The respondent’s statement to the contrary, without more, is unconvincing.
 
Moreover, even assuming the respondent cannot read Spanish or English, he has made no showing that, in the period between his initial apprehension in January 2005 and his apprehension by immigration officials in August 2014, he made any effort to discover the contents of the “papers.” The respondent does not dispute that the Notice to Appear was in his possession in that period of over 9 years. Given the entirety of the circumstances, we remain persuaded that the respondent received legally sufficient notice of his hearing.
 
The respondent’s reliance on Pereira v. Sessions is misplaced. In Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441 (BIA 2018), which post-dated Pereira v. Sessions and the date of filing of the instant motion, the Board held that a Notice to Appear that does not specify the time and place of an alien’s initial removal hearing vests an Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over the removal proceedings and meets the requirements of section 239(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a), so long as a notice of hearing specifying this information is later sent to the alien. Here, as we have already discussed, the respondent received adequate notice of his hearing.
 
We further note that the Act states that any alien who, after receiving the written notice required under sections 239(a)(1) or 239(a)(2) of the Act, fails to attend his hearing he shall be ordered removed in absentia. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act. Moreover, the relevant regulations pertaining to vesting of a charging document with the Immigration Court; defining the essential contents of a Notice to Appear (which does not mention time and place of the hearing); the alien’s obligation to provide an address, and the conduct of in absentia removal proceedings, were all complied with here. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.14(a), 1003.15(c), 1003.26(c), & 1003.26(d).
 
*4 We acknowledge that the Pereira case did involve a case conducted in absentia and included a discussion of the operation of sections 239(a)(1) and 239(a)(2) of the Act within that context. See Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S.Ct. at 2117-18. However, Pereira involved the applicability of the stop-time rule for cancellation of removal, which is not at issue here. Moreover, unlike the respondent, Pereira provided an address to the DHS prior to the issuance of his in absentia order. See id. at 2112.
 
For all of the foregoing reasons, we decline to reopen and terminate these proceedings based on Pereira. Finally, we do not find exceptional circumstances that would warrant sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and supplemental motion to reopen are denied.

The respondent relies on Hernandez-Avalos v. Lynch, 784 F.3d 944 (4th Cir. 2015) to support his eligibility for asylum (Motion to Reopen at 15-19). Besides being nonbinding, the Fourth Circuit’s decision in Hernadez-Avalos is distinguishable. The alien in Hernandez-Avalos established her eligibility for asylum based on events that she had personally experienced in El Salvador. See id. The respondent in this case has no evidence of having received any direct threats.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrea A. Saenz, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Caroline Clark
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals an Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 31, 2018, which denied his request for a continuance.1 The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed a brief in opposition to the appeal. The respondent indicated in his Notice of Appeal that he would be filing a brief on appeal, but has not done so.2 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request for a continuance so that he could apply for special immigrant juvenile (“SIJ”) status (IJ at 2-3). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not shown “good cause” for a continuance (IJ at 2-3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29 (an Immigration Judge may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown). In determining whether good cause exists to continue removal proceedings to await the resolution of a collateral matter, an Immigration Judge should consider: (1) the likelihood that the alien will receive the collateral relief, and (2) whether the relief will materially affect the outcome of the removal proceedings. See Matter of L-A-B-R-, 27 I&N Dec. 405, 413 (BIA 2018). The Immigration Judge should also consider ““whether the alien has exercised reasonable diligence in pursuing that relief, DHS’s position on the motion, the length of the requested continuance, and the procedural history of the case.” Matter of L-A-B-R-, 27 I&N Dec. at 413 (stating that the “good-cause standard in section 1003.29 requires consideration and balancing of all relevant factors in assessing a motion for continuance to accommodate a collateral matter”).
 
The respondent was granted one continuance before the Immigration Judge from June 20, 2018, to July 31, 2018 (IJ at 2; Tr. at 1-2, 5). The respondent did not provide evidence that he filed a Form I-360 petition for SIJ status with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (IJ at 2; Tr. at 12). Although the respondent contends in his Notice of Appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in stating that he was not eligible for SIJ status because he was over 18, the respondent did not submit evidence that he was prima facie eligible for SIJ relief, either before the Immigration Judge, or on appeal (Notice of Appeal; IJ at 2). Thus, based on the aforementioned, we agree that the respondent did not make a persuasive showing of good cause for his requested continuance (IJ at 2-3).
 
*2 The respondent contends in his Notice of Appeal that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel, presumably by not filing for SIJ status (Notice of Appeal). However, the respondent has not shown that he complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Further, to show ineffective assistance of counsel prejudice must be shown. Omar v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 647 (2d Cir. 2008). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent has not made this showing inasmuch as he has not shown that he is eligible for SIJ relief.
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent had conceded removability (IJ at 2). Inasmuch as the respondent has not appealed that determination, we deem it waived. See Matter of R-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 657, 658 n.2 (BIA 2012).

The respondent filed a motion on November 8, 2018, requesting more time to file his brief pending the return of the respondent to the United States after he had been wrongfully removed. The Board sent the respondent’s attorney a letter dated November 13, 2018, informing her that the briefing schedule would not be suspended. A Form I-830 (Notice to EOIR: Alien address) shows that the respondent is now being detained at the Bergen County Jail in New Jersey and thus has presumably been returned.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew L. Hoppock, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mohammad Abdelaziz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on August 13, 2018, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to terminate and finding him removable as charged. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a brief in opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent argues in the motion that his proceedings should be reopened because he is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel by the attorney who represented him on appeal before the Board. Specifically, he alleges that prior counsel failed to raise the most important issues in his appeal brief, failed to cite to controlling Board and Circuit Court precedent, and failed to apprise the Board of the bases for the appeal (Motion at 1).
 
As an initial matter, we agree with the DHS that the respondent has not substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and ineffective assistance of counsel is not clear on the face of the record. See Habchy v. Gonzales, All F.3d 858 (8th Cir. 2006). Although respondent’s current counsel sent his former counsel an email advising him that a disciplinary complaint had been filed, prior counsel was not given an opportunity to respond to the allegations in advance of the filing of the complaint or the respondent’s motion with the Board. The aforementioned email correspondence is dated October 8, 2018, and acknowledges that a bar complaint had already been filed with the Pennsylvania Disciplinary Authority (Motion at Tab A). Moreover, the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed with the Board on October 9, 2018, one day after the email was sent to prior counsel. We do not find this was sufficient time for respondent’s counsel to respond to the allegations. Further, we note that the respondent has submitted a letter from former counsel dated August 28, 2018, regarding his representation of the respondent before the Board and discussions with the respondent regarding possible representation of the respondent in conjunction with a Petition for Review before the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (Motion at Tab B). However, this letter was drafted and sent out prior to current counsel being obtained and over a month before the allegations of ineffectiveness were alleged.
 
Even assuming that the respondent properly complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, the motion is denied because the respondent has not demonstrated prejudice. Valencia v. Holder, 657 F.3d 745, 749 (8th Cir. 2011), citing Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 638. The Eighth Circuit has held that, in order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, aliens must establish that they were prejudiced by their counsel’s performance, which in turn requires a showing that their attorney’s performance was so inadequate that it “may well have resulted in a deportation that would not otherwise have occurred.” Obleshchenko v. Ashcroft, 392 F.3d 970, 972 (8th Cir. 2004); Al-Khouri v. Ashcroft, 362 F.3d 461, 466 (8th Cir. 2004). The court further elaborated that this standard is akin to the requirement under the Sixth Amendment that there be “a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Obleshchenko v. Ashcroft, 392 F.3d at 972.
 
*2 Despite the contentions in the respondent’s motion, the appeal brief contained the arguments that the respondent is now alleging where not raised. The Board considered the arguments regarding whether the foreign conviction was obtained in absentia and thus was inconsistent with United States standards of due process, whether the foreign conviction statute was divisible, and whether the DHS had established the respondent was the same person as the defendant in the criminal proceedings (See Decision of the Board, dated August 13, 2018, at 2-3). We considered all of these arguments and found them unpersuasive when we dismissed his appeal. Specifically, as the DHS notes in its opposition to the current motion, the respondent was not convicted in absentia, was represented by counsel, and only absconded before the final appeal in his case was resolved. Thus, none of the case law cited or additional arguments raised in the respondent’s motion to reopen convince us of error in our prior decision. As such, the respondent has not established prejudice from prior counsel’s actions or inactions warranting reopening of his proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.1

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Myong O. Chung, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s June 26, 2018, decision denying the respondent’s motion for a continuance and ordering him removed to Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and, as the respondent did not appear eligible for any form of relief, he ordered the respondent removed (IJ at 3-4). On appeal, the respondent claims that the Immigration Judge erred in not granting him a continuance (Notice of Appeal). An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance “for good cause shown,” within his sound discretion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of L-A-B-R-, 27 I&N Dec. 405 (A.G. 2018); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 790-93 (BIA 2009); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 355-56 (BIA 1983); Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987). “[A]n Immigration Judge’s decision denying [a] motion for continuance will not be reversed unless the alien establishes that the denial caused him actual prejudice and harm and materially affected the outcome of his case.” Matter of Villarreal, 23 I&N Dec. 886, 891 (BIA 2006).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s request for a continuance (IJ at 2-4). The Immigration Judge did not err in not granting another continuance as the respondent did not demonstrate good cause (IJ at 3-4). In the instant case, the respondent requested a continuance so that he could pursue an S visa application with DHS. However, as noted by the Immigration Judge, the DHS has sole jurisdiction over such applications. Thus, we find that the respondent has not demonstrated any prejudice as a result of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his continuance request. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. at 354; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. Accordingly, we find no error in the decision of the Immigration Judge to deny a continuance. Therefore, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
*2 During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand alleging ineffective assistance by his former attorney. We take note that the respondent has not complied with any of the evidentiary requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).1 See also Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948, 953 (5th Cir. 2012) (court requires strict Lozada compliance). Moreover, the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s actions. See De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir. 2004) (noting that “an alien must make an initial showing of substantial prejudice” to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
To the extent that the respondent has submitted new evidence with his appeal, we generally cannot consider any new evidence proffered on appeal. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). The additional documentation here is not sufficiently material as to warrant a remand. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed and the motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lynn M. Burke, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jessica C. Wallace
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision of June 21, 2018, which denied his motion for a continuance in his removal proceedings and ordered him to be removed. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review all other issues under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. He did not apply for any relief from removal but instead requested a continuance in his removal proceedings to petition the state criminal court to modify his conviction based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in his criminal proceedings, specifically that he did not have a Spanish translator during his guilty plea. The Immigration Judge found that such a petition may take an indeterminate amount of time and that it is speculative as to whether it will be successful.1 He therefore denied the respondent’s request for a continuance, and ordered him to be removed.
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s argument on appeal that, because his right to effective assistance of counsel in his criminal proceedings is a constitutionally protected right, the Immigration Judge should have granted his request for a continuance to allow for the adjudication of his pending motion for appropriate relief in state court. The respondent claims that he filed his motion in state court on July 23, 2018, but his evidence indicates that it was actually filed on July 27, 2018. See Brief at 4, Exh. J. As both dates are more than a month after the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for a continuance, it was not pending in state court at the time that the Immigration Judge denied the continuance.
 
Upon our de novo review, we find that the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s continuance request. An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance in his discretion if good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Zafar v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 461 F.3d 1357, 1360 (11th Cir. 2006) (a request for a continuance to await the approval of the pending labor certification which was speculative was properly denied because it did not demonstrate good cause); Matter of L-A-B-R-, 27 I&N Dec. 405 (A.G. 2018) (an Immigration Judge may grant a motion for a continuance of removal proceedings only for good cause shown, and when a respondent requests a continuance to pursue collateral relief, the Immigration Judge must consider primarily the likelihood that the collateral relief will be granted and will materially affect the outcome of the removal proceedings); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).
 
*2 Further, an Immigration Judge’s decision denying a continuance will not be reversed unless the alien establishes that the denial caused him actual prejudice and harm and materially affected the outcome of his removal proceedings. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987); Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 355-56 (BIA 1983) (a decision to deny a continuance will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondents were deprived of a full and fair hearing). The respondent has not shown that the Immigration Judge failed to consider the relevant factors for a continuance in his removal proceedings, or that he abused his discretion in denying a continuance to pursue collateral relief in state court. See Matter of L-A-B-R-, 27 I&N Dec. at 405; Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807 (BIA 2012). He has not shown that the denial of the continuance caused him actual prejudice in his removal proceedings or materially affected the outcome of his removal proceedings. The respondent’s conviction has not been vacated by the criminal court and remains valid for immigration purposes. See Matter of L-A-B-R-, 27 I&N Dec. at 405.
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Laura Perez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s November 27, 2017, decision denying her motion to reopen her removal proceedings.1 The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent filed a motion to reopen and rescind her in absentia removal order, arguing that her failure to appear at her missed hearing was the result of exceptional circumstances (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen). This motion to reopen is untimely, as it was filed more than 5 years after the respondent was ordered removed on July 19, 2012. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C) of the Act (stating that an in absentia removal order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances). Additionally, because the respondent previously filed a motion to reopen in 2012, her present motion to reopen is number barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (stating that an alien may file only one motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order).
 
The respondent argues that the time and numerical limitations on her motion to reopen should be equitably tolled based on the ineffective assistance rendered by attorney Carlos, whom she hired to file her first motion to reopen (Respondent’s Br. at 16-18)2. Specifically, the respondent alleges that attorney Carlos did not comply with the Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, resulting in the denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen (Respondent’s Br. at 16-17).
 
The respondent has not, however, demonstrated that she acted with due diligence in discovering attorney Carlos’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 679 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that equitable tolling of the deadlines and numerical limits for a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel requires that an alien act with reasonable diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). The respondent first had reason to suspect attorney Carlos’s purported deficient representation when the Immigration Judge denied her motion to reopen, in part, because she did not comply with the Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 637, requirements (IJ, Aug. 16, 2012). See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d at 679 (noting that in determining whether an alien exercised due diligence, an adjudicator must first determine if and when a reasonable person in the alien’s position would suspect the specific fraud or error underlying the motion to reopen). The respondent has not shown that she took any affirmative steps-- including consulting with an attorney--to investigate the suspected deficient representation during the approximately 5 years between when her motion to reopen was denied in 2012 and when she hired her present counsel in 2017 (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 21, Tab C). See id. at 680-81. We therefore conclude that the respondent has not exercised due diligence, and is not entitled to equitable tolling of the time and numerical limitations on her motion to reopen.
 
*2 Even if the respondent’s motion to reopen were not time and number barred, she has not demonstrated that her failure to appear at the hearing was the result of exceptional circumstances beyond her control. See section 240(e)(1) of the Act. The respondent claims that she did not attend her July 19, 2012, hearing because her prior attorney did not timely inform her that she needed to attend the hearing (Respondent’s Br. at 13-16). She further argues that this constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and excuses her failure to appear at her missed hearing. See Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, 327 F.3d 892, 896 (9th Cir. 2003) (noting that if an alien fails to appear because of his actual and reasonable reliance on erroneous advice of counsel, it can constitute an exceptional circumstance beyond the alien’s control), amended by 339 F.3d 1012 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
The respondent was given oral notice of her July 19, 2012, hearing by the Immigration Judge on March 31, 2011 (IJ, Nov. 27, 2017; IJ, Aug. 16, 2012). The record further indicates that the respondent was personally served with the notice of hearing for her July 19, 2012, hearing, and that the notice of hearing warns her of the consequences for failing to appear (Notice of Hearing, Mar. 31, 2011). Even if the respondent’s prior attorney did not attempt to timely remind her of the hearing date--a claim the prior attorney disputes--the respondent does not allege in her affidavit or on appeal that she attempted to ask her attorney or the Immigration Court the date of her next hearing (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tabs C, Q). While we recognize that the respondent previously attended two hearings before the Immigration Judge and filed her first motion to reopen less than 2 weeks after she was ordered removed, we nonetheless conclude that the totality of the circumstances do not establish that her failure to appear at her missed hearing was the result of exceptional circumstance warranting reopening of her removal proceedings. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act; Matter of W-F-, 21 I&N Dec. 503, 509 (BIA 1996).
 
We further conclude that the respondent’s case does not warrant sua sponte reopening (Respondent’s Br. at 20-22). Sua sponte authority is invoked sparingly and reserved for truly exceptional circumstances. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-35 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (explaining that sua sponte reopening is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship). While we are sympathetic to the harm the respondent purportedly suffered as a child in Mexico and her fears of return, we do not find that the particular facts in this case demonstrate truly exceptional circumstances warranting sua sponte reopening. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. at 1133-35. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Gabriela Parra, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, on April 16, 2018, filed an untimely motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel.1 The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. We find that the respondent has properly asserted a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (Motion at Tab D). See generally Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-640 (BIA 1988). The respondent asserts that but for ineffective assistance of counsel, which he asserts caused him to be removed in absentia, he would have been given the opportunity to voluntarily depart, and would have chosen to do so. Considering the totality of circumstances presented in the motion, and the lack of any opposition to the motion from the Department of Homeland Security, the motion will be granted and the record will be remanded to allow the respondent the opportunity to seek any relief for which he may be eligible. Given the disposition of this matter, we need not further address the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to terminate proceedings is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings not inconsistent with this order and entry of a new decision.

By a supplemental motion filed on July 9, 2018, the respondent seeks the termination of proceedings in light of Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S.Ct. 2105 (2018). The respondent avers that termination is appropriate insofar as the Notice to Appear issued to him on July 3, 2014, did not include the date and time of his prospective hearing before an Immigration Judge. However, a subsequent notice informed the respondent of the date and time of his hearing, September 2, 2015, which is not a matter of dispute. See Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441, 441 (BIA 2018) (Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018), distinguished). Therefore, the motion to terminate these proceedings will be denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Susana Abarca, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jorge Ramos
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative decision on August 7, 2015, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s May 30, 2014, written decision denying a previous motion to reopen proceedings in which the respondent was ordered removed to the Dominican Republic in December 1999 because he did not comply with a voluntary departure order. The respondent has filed another motion to reopen, averring that his prior counsel deficiently represented him by not seeking to apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility (Form I-601A) on his behalf in the May 2014 motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland ‘ecurity opposes the motion, which will be denied, as the respondent has not demonstrated that an exception to the time and number limits applies. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent has not meaningfully raised his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, where he has not shown compliance with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), including, inter alia, notification to prior counsel of the alleged deficient representation. Current counsel’s assertion that the respondent contacted prior counsel several unspecified times and informed him of the alleged deficient representation is insufficient. Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980) (statements of counsel are not considered evidence). Current counsel has provided no explanation why she has not notified prior counsel of the alleged deficient performance. Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2004) (emphasizing importance of Lozada notification requirement, to afford prior counsel an adequate opportunity to respond to the alleged deficient performance). Nor is the purported State of New York Grievance Committee complaint, dated April 10, 2018, adequate notification to the respondent’s former counsel. Taveras-Duran v. Holder, 767 F.3d 120, 123-24 (1st Cir. 2014) (recognizing Board’s discretionary authority to deny motions to reopen for failure to comply with Lozada requirements).
 
The respondent also has not demonstrated the requisite diligence to pursue an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Neves v. Holder, 613 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 2010) (the equitable tolling doctrine extends statutory deadlines only in extraordinary circumstances, where parties were prevented from complying through no fault or lack of diligence of their own); Chedid v. Holder, 573 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 2009) (observing that equitable tolling should be sparingly invoked and is foreclosed where aliens do not exercise due diligence).1 The respondent should have inquired about his potential eligibility for adjustment of status when the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services approved a visa petition on his behalf in 2002 (Respondent’s Mot., tab C). If he had done so then he would have known that a provisional unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility was necessary to apply for adjustment of status when prior counsel filed his motion to reopen in May 2014. Because the respondent waited an additional 4 years since the motion to allege ineffective assistance of counsel, we are not persuaded that he has diligently pursued the claim. Chedid v. Holder, 573 F.3d at 37 (affirming Board’s finding that alien did not act with due diligence, where he waited approximately 1 year to pursue ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
*2 Further, we are not persuaded that prior counsel’s allegedly deficient representation prejudiced the respondent. Muyubisnay-Cungachi v. Holder, 734 F.3d 66, 72 (1st Cir. 2010) (observing that an alien must demonstrate a reasonable probability that counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced him or deprived him of a fundamentally fair hearing). Considering then-applicable regulations, the respondent has not shown that he was eligible for an unlawful presence waiver when prior counsel filed the motion to reopen in May 2014, given the respondent’s final removal order. 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(vi) (2013).
 
Finally, the respondent has not established an exceptional situation warranting sua sponte reopening. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Although we sympathize with his wife’s health issues, we do not have the authority to grant relief from removal solely on equitable grounds. Matter of Silva-Rodriguez, 20 I&N Dec. 448 (BIA 1992).
 
Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven Laxton, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Casey J. Johnson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; termination
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 4, 2000, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On August 16, 2018, almost 18 years after the Board’s order, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, remand, and terminate. The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
We will first address the respondent’s argument that his proceedings should be reopened, his removal order rescinded, and his proceedings terminated, or in the alternative remanded to the Immigration Judge, in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Pereira v. Sessions 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018). The respondent argues that, because the Notice to Appear in his case did not contain a specific date and time of hearing, under Pereira, this document does not constitute a Notice to Appear, jurisdiction over his case did not vest with the Immigration Court, and therefore the removal proceedings against him should be terminated (Moton at 1-2).
 
However, in the respondent’s case, the Notice to Appear did specify the date and time of his hearing, as “February 4, 1998[,] at 9:00 a.m.” as well as the place of his hearing, i.e., the Chicago Immigration Court (Exh. 1). Inasmuch as the Notice to Appear satisfied the date and time requirement addressed in Pereira v. Sessions, the respondent’s arguments seeking termination or remand of the proceedings based on that decision are inapposite.
 
We will next address the respondent’s arguments regarding ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the respondent argues that attorney Gary Spraker, who represented him at hearing and on appeal, provided ineffective assistance because in 1996 he filed an unmeritorious application for adjustment of status for the respondent, for the purpose of obtaining an employment authorization, which was denied by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), and which resulted in the initiation of the removal proceedings against him. The respondent argues that attorney Spraker was disciplined by bar authorities in 2001 for such actions (Motion at 2-4).
 
However, the respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was not filed within 90 days of the Board’s final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent acknowledges that attorney Spraker was disciplined in 2001, shortly after the completion of the respondent’s proceedings.1 The respondent has not explained how he exercised due diligence in filing a motion to reopen based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim nearly 18 years after the alleged ineffective assistance. See El-Gazawy v. Holder, 690 F.3d 852, 859-860 (7th Cir. 2012).
 
*2 In any event, attorney Spraker’s action now complained of by the respondent was conduct prior to the issuance of the Notice to Appear and therefore outside the removal proceeding, rather than during the removal proceeding itself. Therefore, this conduct did not affect the fairness or outcome of the proceeding itself. To establish a due process violation based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must show, inter alia, that the alleged ineffective assistance prevented him from receiving a fair hearing and that the lack of a fair hearing actually had the potential for affecting the outcome of the proceedings. El-Gazawy v. Holder, 690 F.3d at 860; see also Rapheal v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 521, 533 (7th Cir. 2008); Hamid v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 642, 646-47 (7th Cir. 2005) (applicant’s failure to allege excluded testimony that would potentially affect outcome of hearing was fatal to due process claim).
 
To the extent the purported deficiencies in the attorney’s representation in the case did not pertain to the actual substance of the hearing (e.g., evidence presented or omitted, arguments raised or overlooked), or call the hearing’s fairness into question, the respondent has not shown that reopening is warranted based on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See also Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004), amended sub nom. Lara-Torres v. Gonzales, 404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir. 2005). Furthermore, despite the acknowledgement in the motion regarding Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (Motion at 4), the respondent has not shown that he has complied with the requirements set forth in that decision. Based on the above, the motion based on ineffective assistance of counsel will be denied.
 
The respondent also urges us to sua sponte reopen his proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), based on a number of factors in his case, including the approved Form I-130 visa petition filed by his United States citizen daughter, his long period or residence in the United States and minimal criminal record, and other factors. We do not find that the respondent’s case presents an exceptional situation that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the power to reopen sua sponte “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). Based on the above, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Perham Makabi, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, appeals a March 1, 2018, decision by an Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a response. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
In an October 17, 2017, decision, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure until on or before February 14, 2018, and issued an alternate order of removal. The respondent filed his motion to reopen on February 13, 2018. The respondent contends that proceedings should be reopened because his prior attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by both advising him to request voluntary departure and failing to apply for Special Immigrant Juvenile (“SIJ”) status. He asserts that he is eligible for SIJ status.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel necessary to reopen proceedings by accepting voluntary departure and not pursuing the respondent’s asylum claim (IJ at 2-3). An alien is bound by the reasonable tactical decisions of his counsel. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986); Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310-11 (BIA 1988). The respondent’s attorney’s determination to accept voluntary departure qualifies as a reasonable tactical decision inasmuch as the respondent’s asylum application only refers to gang violence, and the respondent has not shown that he would have been eligible for asylum based on this fear (IJ at 2).
 
As to the respondent’s claim that his attorney failed to pursue SIJ status, the respondent has not shown that he revealed enough information to his attorney to establish that he was potentially eligible for this status (IJ at 3). The respondent’s current counsel indicates at one point that the respondent never told his former counsel about the abuse (Notice of Appeal). However, he also indicates that the respondent told his former counsel that he left Honduras because of the abuse (Motion to Reopen at 2). The respondent’s declaration itself is not clear regarding exactly what he told his prior counsel (Declaration with Motion to Reopen).
 
The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in stating that he had not filed an action in family court that would result in the issuance of the order necessary for an I-360 petition (Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er) or Special Immigrant) (Respondent’s Br. at 7; IJ at 3). While the respondent correctly notes that he submitted evidence with his motion showing submission of an action in family court, it is speculative that this request will be approved (Respondent’s Br. at 7; Motion to Reopen Exh. C (Petition for Appointment as Guardian of a Person); IJ at 3). Moreover, the respondent’s petition does not ask the family court whether the respondent not returning to Honduras would be in his best interests, and it is otherwise not clear the petition complies with all the regulatory standards. 8 C.F.R. § 204.11(c)(3)-(6). Therefore, it is not apparent that an action by the family court will necessarily support an I-360 petition.
 
*2 Further, in the respondent’s brief submitted on June 7, 2018, he indicated that the family court proceeding would be finalized in a few weeks, but he has not provided an update as to the outcome of that proceeding (Respondent’s Br. at 4). Thus, based on the aforementioned, the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by any action of his prior attorney by not filing for SIJ status. See Omar v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 647 (2d Cir. 2008) (to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, prejudice must be shown); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (the term “prejudice” refers to actual prejudice).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Jessica Soley
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATIONS: Reopening; remand; termination of proceedings
 
*1 This case was last before us on November 15, 2011, when we denied the respondent’s second motion to reopen her removal proceedings. On April 19, 2018, the respondent submitted the instant motion to reopen and remand pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. She requests termination of her removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion. The motion exceeds both the time and number limitations for motions to reopen, and it will be denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2); section 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i)(an alien may file only one motion to reopen and, with certain exceptions, it shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order). The respondent’s termination request will also be denied.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of the Philippines. On October 26, 2005, the Immigration Judge pretermitted her application for adjustment of status based on an employment-based visa petition and ordered her to be removed from the United States. The respondent previously sought to have her proceedings reopened based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and to apply for adjustment of status. She now seeks reopening, a remand of the record, and termination of her proceedings to apply for adjustment of status based on an approved visa petition on her behalf filed by her adult United States citizen son. She contends that reopening sua sponte is warranted.
 
The number-barred motion to reopen has also been filed out of time, and has not been shown to come within any exception to the filing requirements for motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). A new claim of eligibility for adjustment of status is generally not a circumstance warranting the grant of an untimely or number-barred motion to reopen. We have considered the argument and evidence presented with the motion. However, the respondent has not shown the exceptional circumstances necessary to warrant our granting this untimely motion in the exercise of our sua sponte authority. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We find no basis to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings, or to terminate the respondent’s removal proceedings. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen and remand, and request for termination of her proceedings, are denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent was ordered removed in absentia in 2005, and the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen on March 16, 2016. On April 20, 2018, the respondent filed the present motion asking the Board to sua sponte reopen these removal proceedings to allow her to apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver (Form I-601A) in conjunction with an application for adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen is both time and number-barred and will be denied on that basis. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Moreover, the power to reopen sua sponte allows reopening in exceptional situations not present here. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). The respondent urges that the hardship to her United States citizen spouse upon her removal warrants sua sponte reopening. We acknowledge the challenges that the respondent’s spouse may face, but there appears to be no basis for reopening outside of the time and numerical constraints imposed by law given the present record and the evidence submitted in support of the motion.
 
We only separately note that it is undisputed that the respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear, which contains the date, time, and place of her scheduled hearing. The respondent’s claim that she did not receive proper notice of her hearing was fully considered and addressed by both the Immigration Judge and the Board.1
 
Finally, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(iv), the respondent does not need to have her removal proceedings reopened to be able to pursue a Form I-601A waiver with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). In addition, she may request an administrative stay of removal from the DHS while any waiver, or provisional waiver, applications are pending before the USCIS. See 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a). Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

To the extent the respondent contends that she received ineffective assistance from former counsel in connection with these removal proceedings below, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for advancing such a claim, including the requirement that she show prejudice resulting from former counsel’s alleged deficient performance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001) (noting that to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate that counsel’s performance resulted in substantial prejudice); Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F. 3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994) (proving prejudice requires the petitioner to make a prima facie showing that, absent counsel’s deficient performance, he would have been entitled to the relief the sought).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Orlando Mondragon, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Geoffrey D. Rieman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s November 16, 2017, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen her removal proceedings. While this appeal was pending, the respondent also filed another motion to reopen with this Board. The appeal will be dismissed and the respondent’s second motion to reopen is denied.
 
We review the Immigration Judge’s factual findings for clear error, including findings as to the credibility of testimony. We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
On March 2, 2011, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s request for voluntary departure prior to the conclusion of her removal proceedings (IJ at 1, 5-6). See section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b). The respondent did not depart the United States on or before the expiration of her voluntary departure period (IJ at 6). Six years later, on October 5, 2017, the respondent filed a motion to reopen sua sponte. The respondent sought reopening based on her argument that the Immigration Judge failed to ask her if she had a fear of persecution in Mexico. The respondent claimed that she feared persecution in Mexico based on the particular social group of her family. The respondent also sought reopening so that she could submit applications for a U visa and for relief under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). The respondent claimed that her lawful permanent resident husband was emotionally, psychologically, and physically abusive to her and to her children (IJ at 2, 3). See Motion to Reopen Sua Sponte; Addendum to Motion to Reopen at 2.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen on November 16, 2017. The respondent now appeals that decision. Despite indicating on her Notice of Appeal that she intended to file an appeal brief, the respondent did not do so. Instead, she filed another Motion to Reopen and to Terminate Removal proceedings based on the Supreme Court’s decision in Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018).1
 
With regard to the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of her first motion to reopen, in her Notice of Appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by finding that the Digital Audio Recording of the respondent’s March 2, 2011, hearing is intelligible and provides a full and accurate record of the hearing (IJ at 4). The respondent states that she has not been able to “find a playable track” of the hearing. Notice of Appeal at 2. In the Immigration Judge’s November 16, 2017, decision, however, the Immigration Judge set forth a detailed summary of the March 2, 2011, hearing (IJ at 4-6). The respondent was present at the hearing and has not indicated that the Immigration Judge’s summary is inaccurate. In any event, the respondent has not shown that she was prejudiced by this alleged error. See Molina v. Holder, 763 F.3d 1259, 1263 (10th Cir. 2014) (respondent cannot succeed on a due process claim without showing that the alleged error materially affected the outcome of her case).
 
*2 The respondent also argues in her Notice of Appeal that her proceedings should be reopened because she has requested that the Vermont Service Center issue an expedited decision on her U visa application. Notice of Appeal at 2. This Notice of Appeal was filed on November 24, 2017, however, which was almost 1 year ago. The respondent has not provided any indication since then that the Vermont Service Center has issued a decision. Nonetheless, the Board generally lacks authority to reopen proceedings of aliens who are under a final order of removal and who seek relief, such as a U visa, over which the Board has no jurisdiction. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 107 (BIA 2009).
 
Further, the respondent appears to argue that her proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Notice of Appeal at 2. To the extent that the respondent raised this argument before the Immigration Judge in her motion to reopen, she has not attempted to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009); Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 261 n.1 (BIA 2007) (matters not raised before the Immigration Judge are waived on appeal).
 
Moreover, the respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge erred by denying reopening so that she can file a self-petition under the VAWA. She claims that she was living with her lawful permanent resident boyfriend and ““being abused by him at the time of her hearing” before the Immigration Judge. Notice of Appear at 2; Addendum to Motion to Reopen at 2-3. Because the respondent alleges that her boyfriend abused her at the time of her hearing, she has not shown that these allegations were unavailable and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent also has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for VAWA relief and that she merits relief as a matter of discretion (IJ at 8). See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 106 (1988); Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 419 (BIA 1996). For these reasons, we uphold the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s first motion to reopen.
 
In addition, as explained above, during the pendency of this appeal, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen based on the Supreme Court’s decision in Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018). In that case, the Supreme Court addressed the narrow issue of whether a Notice to Appear that does not designate a specific time or place of a removal proceeding triggers the stop-time rule which ends the accrual of the alien’s period of continuous physical presence in the United States for purposes of cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1).
 
*3 Here, the respondent relies on Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. at 2119, and argues that, because her September 22, 2009, Notice to Appear did not contain the time or place of a removal hearing, her proceedings should be reopened and she should be permitted to file an application for cancellation of removal (Exh. 1). See Second Motion to Reopen at 3-4.
 
Generally, an alien may file one motion to reopen and it must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceedings sought to be reopened. See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Act. In this case, the respondent has filed two motions to reopen, and the second motion was filed on September 20, 2018, which was not within 90 days of the Immigration Judge’s November 16, 2017, decision. In order to avoid the time and numeric limitations, however, the respondent argues that these limitations should be equitably tolled, or that the Board should reopen the proceedings sua sponte. See Second Motion to Reopen at 5-8.
 
Contrary to the respondent’s argument, this Board recently decided Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441, 447 (BIA 2018). In that case, the Board held that a Notice to Appear that does not specify the time and place of a removal proceedings vests jurisdiction with the Immigration Judge over the removal proceedings and satisfies section 239(a) of the Act as long as a Notice of Hearing setting forth this information is subsequently sent to the alien. See Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. at 447; see also section 239(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a). In this case, it is undisputed that the respondent appeared for her master calendar hearing on November 24, 2010, and for subsequent hearings. Therefore, the respondent received notice of the time and place of her removal hearings. For these reasons, consistent with Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. at 447, the respondent has not established that reopening is warranted on account of a lack of notice. Moreover, the respondent has not demonstrated that an exceptional situation exists which calls for sua sponte reopening. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). For these reasons, we deny the respondent’s second motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s Motion to Reopen and Terminate Removal Proceedings is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent states in her most recent motion to reopen that she was removed from the United States, re-entered illegally on June 5, 2018, and was convicted for illegal re-entry. She also states that she is being held in detention awaiting a credible fear interview. Motion to Reopen at 2.

IN RE: HERMINIA ROSADO
File: AXXX-XX7-151 - Newark, NJ

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Cheryl Lin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order of removal in the respondent’s case on February 5, 2008. The respondent now moves the Board to reconsider our March 5, 2018, decision denying her untimely, number-barred motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). She specifically challenges the Board’s decision not to reopen the proceedings sua sponte to enable her to apply for adjustment of status. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The motion will be denied.
 
This Board has limited authority to reopen and reconsider cases sua sponte in truly exceptional situations. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999). However, “[t]he power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship.” Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). The respondent asserts that she did not seek sua sponte reopening to cure filing defects. Rather, she requested reopening sua sponte “because it took may years for [her] to become eligible to adjust status [] because [h]er son [] became a permanent resident in 2007 and a naturalized citizen in 2011” (Respondent’s Mot. at 8). We emphasize that becoming potentially eligible for relief many years after the entry of a final order of removal is not an “exceptional situation” warranting sua sponte reopening.
 
The respondent also asserts that the Board should reconsider our decision because we noted in a footnote that she could apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver before the USCIS. She essentially asserts that she is not prima facie eligible for such relief because she is separated from her husband who is her sole qualifying relative for the waiver. We find no error in our footnote to warrant to reconsideration. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
In sum, the respondent has not identified an error of fact or law in our prior order to warrant reconsideration of our denial of her untimely, number-barred motion to reopen.1 See section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). We recognize that the respondent has acquired equities in the United States, and that her removal will likely result in hardship to the respondent and her family. Nevertheless, the respondent’s prior motion did not demonstrate an exceptional situation to persuade the Board to exercise its sua sponte discretion in this matter.2 Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

To the extent that the respondent offers evidence with the instant motion, such evidence has not been shown to comply with the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).

2

The respondent now asserts that she is not removable as charged in the Notice to Appear. The respondent, however, did not raise this issue on appeal or in a prior motion to reopen. Motions to reopen and reconsider are not opportunities to present previously available evidence or to raise arguments that could have been raised on appeal. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 n.2 (BIA 1991) (discussing the characteristics of motions to reopen and motions to reconsider). To the extent that the respondent implies that her prior attorney incorrectly conceded the charge set forth in the NTA, she has not established that the filing restrictions imposed on motions to reopen before the Board should be equitably tolled. The respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, nor demonstrated that she exercised due diligence in bringing this matter before the Board. See Fadiga v. Attorney Gen. U.S., 488 F.3d 142, 157 (3d Cir. 2007); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: MACJHAY YAGAO
File: AXXX-XX6-445 - San Diego, CA
October 16, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrew M. Knapp, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on July 29, 2016, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal, denied his motion to administratively close proceedings, and denied his motion to terminate proceedings. On July 20, 2018, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reconsider this decision, and a motion to terminate proceedings. 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(b).1 The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be remanded to the Immigration Court.
 
The respondent first contends that his proceedings should be terminated in light of the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018). In particular, the respondent claims that his Notice to Appear (Form I-862) was defective because it failed to designate the date and time of his hearing as required under section 239(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a). Accordingly, the respondent argues, the filing of the Notice to Appear with the Immigration Court in his case was insufficient to vest jurisdiction with the Immigration Court.
 
The decision in Pereira v. Sessions involved the “stop-time” rule in cancellation of removal cases. The respondent asserts that the decision should not be limited to such cases, but should be applied to all Notices to Appear that do not include the time and place of the hearing. However, as this Board recently explained in Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441 (BIA 2018), a Notice to Appear that does not specify the time or place of an alien’s initial removal hearing vests an Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over the removal proceedings, and meets the requirements of section 239(a) of the Act, so long as a notice of hearing specifying this information is later sent to the alien. The record indicates that the respondent subsequently received proper notices of his removal hearings, which specified the dates, times, and locations of his scheduled hearings, and that he attended these hearings (IJ at 2). Consequently, the requirements of section 239(a) of the Act were satisfied in this case, and termination is unwarranted.
 
However, in supplemental pleadings, the respondent has submitted evidence that the Court of Appeals, Fourth Appellate District, Division One, State of California, has sustained the respondent’s appeal from his denial of post-conviction relief. Therein, the California appellate court found that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel because he was not properly informed of the immigration consequences of pleading guilty to a violation of California Health and Safety Code § 11360(a). The appellate court remanded the respondent’s criminal proceedings so that he would be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea to this offense.
 
*2 While the respondent has not proffered post-conviction relief which, as yet, directly affects his removability, we find the appellate court’s decision to be an exceptional situation which warrants a remand of this record for further proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (Board will exercise its sua sponte authority over an untimely motion only in an “exceptional situation”); Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373 (A.G. 2002). The respondent’s sole charge of removability rests upon his conviction under Cal. Health and Safety Code § 11360(a), and it appears that, upon remand, the California trial court will vacate the conviction based on due process concerns. See Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006); Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). As such, we will remand the record to allow both parties to submit further evidence related to the respondent’s removability, and the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The request for administrative closure is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

The record of proceeding also contains a pleading by the respondent, certified to the Board by the Immigration Judge on March 22, 2017, which requests administrative closure of these proceedings. The respondent’s request will be denied based on the recent guidelines set forth in Matter of Castro-Tum, 27 I&N Dec. 271 (A.G. 2018).

IN RE: DIEGO LUCAS-MOLINA
File: AXXX-XX7-340 - Phoenix, AZ

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eric G. Bjotvedt, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Edith M. Lucero
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Administrative closure; remand; termination
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 17, 2017. The respondent has submitted a motion to remand and a motion to terminate. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has submitted a motion for summary affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision and has opposed the respondent’s motion to terminate. The appeal will be dismissed and the motions will be denied.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
In the Notice of Appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his request for administrative closure, and suggests that he should have been granted administrative closure because he was not an enforcement priority and there was a new administration at the time of his final hearing (Notice of Appeal at 2). However, the respondent has not explained or shown, before the Immigration Judge or on appeal, that these are sufficient reasons for administrative closure under Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012), overruled by Matter of Castro-Tum, 27 I&N Dec. 271 (A.G. 2018). In any event, since the Immigration Judge’s decision, the Attorney General ruled in Matter of Castro-Tum, 27 I&N Dec. 271, that Immigration Judges and the Board do not have the general authority to suspend indefinitely immigration proceedings by administrative closure, subject to certain exceptions that are not applicable here. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent has submitted a motion to remand, showing that he has married a spouse who has filed for a U nonimmigrant status and therefore he may qualify as a derivative beneficiary of a U visa if this application is approved (Motion to Remand Exhs. A-D). However, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has sole jurisdiction over all petitions for U nonimmigrant status, rather than the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1). Furthermore, the respondent is not precluded from seeking a U visa from the USCIS by the fact that he is the subject of a final order of removal.1 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1)(ii). Accordingly, the motion to remand based on the U visa application will be denied.
 
*2 In the motion to remand, the respondent has submitted an asylum application and argues that the right to apply for asylum was not explained to him at hearing (Motion to Remand Exh. E). The respondent states that he fears returning to Guatemala because he is a native Mayan and has experienced social discrimination and limited educational, economic, and other opportunities (Motion to Remand Exh. E, Form I-589 at 5). However, the respondent was represented at hearing by an attorney, who indicated that the respondent was advised of his immigration rights (Tr. at 14). The respondent has submitted a declaration stating that he was never advised of the possibility of asylum (Motion to Remand Exh. F). However, the respondent has not made a valid ineffective assistance of counsel claim by complying with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and he has not explained why he could not do so. Accordingly, the motion to remand for asylum application will be denied.2
 
In the motion to terminate, the respondent argues that his proceedings should be reopened, his removal order rescinded, and his proceedings terminated, in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018). The respondent argues that, because the Notice to Appear in his case did not contain a specific date and time of hearing as the Notice to Appear in Pereira, this document does not constitute a Notice to Appear, jurisdiction over his case did not vest with the Immigration Court, and therefore the removal proceedings against him should be terminated.
 
However, the Supreme Court’s decision did not hold that a Notice to Appear that did not contain a specific date and time of hearing was invalid for all purposes or did not validly initiate removal proceedings. Rather, the Supreme Court focused on the specific question whether such a Notice to Appear triggers the stop-time rule for purposes of cancellation of removal. Section 240A(d)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(d)(1)(B). Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. at 2113 (stating that “the dispositive question in this case is much narrower ...: Does a “notice to appear” that does not specify the “time and place at which the proceedings will be held” . . . trigger the stop-time rule?”). Therefore, the Supreme Court’s decision does not warrant termination of the respondent’s proceedings.
 
In Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441 (BIA 2018), the Board held that a notice to appear that does not specify the time and place of an alien’s initial removal hearing vests an Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over the removal proceedings and meets the requirements of section 239(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a), so long as a notice of hearing specifying this information is later sent to the alien. For the reasons set forth in Matter of Bermudez-Cota, we will deny the respondent’s motion to terminate.
 
*3 The Immigration Judge granted a 60-day period of voluntary departure to the respondent. The respondent submitted proof on appeal that the voluntary departure bond has been posted, therefore the period of voluntary departure will be reinstated. Based on the above, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motions are denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

While the pendency of an application for a U visa has no effect on the government’s authority to execute a removal order, an applicant for a U visa is permitted to file a request for a stay of removal with the DHS. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(1)(ii). If the USCIS approves the respondent’s application, the regulation allows him to file a motion to reopen and terminate proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(5)(i).

The respondent also has not argued or shown that the past or future social discrimination and lack of opportunities he describes may rise to the level of persecution or torture.

*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 27, 2018. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged.1 On appeal, the respondent challenges the denial of a continuance. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
At the hearing on April 26, 2018, the respondent requested a continuance of proceedings to enable him to pursue post-conviction relief with regard to the conviction that serves as a basis for removal and renders him ineligible for relief from removal. The respondent alleged that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of this conviction, and he has filed a motion to vacate it (Tr. at 59-60).2 The respondent was granted continuances for that and other purposes from June 27, 2017, to April 27, 2018 (Tr. at 12, 17-19, 24, 29, 41-42, 50-51, 60). The respondent’s post-conviction motion to challenge his criminal conviction on constitutional grounds was still pending on that date, and the IJ denied further continuance (IJ at 2; Tr. at 62). On appeal, the respondent challenges denial of the continuance. The respondent does not indicate that the conviction has been vacated.
 
An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance where good cause is shown. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. See also Matter of L-A-B-R-, 27 I&N Dec. 405 (A.G. 2018); Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009); Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009). We find that the Immigration Judge appropriately considered the relevant factors to determine whether good cause for a continuance was shown. We conclude that good cause was not shown.
 
While the respondent is free to pursue the post-conviction motion, such a motion does not justify a continuance of the removal proceedings against the respondent. See Matter of L-A-B-R- at 417 (observing that collateral attacks on criminal convictions are often too speculative to warrant a continuance). The respondent’s post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction does not render the conviction non-final. See Matter Acosta, 27 I&N Dec. 420 (BIA 2018).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010), the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates the right to counsel. See also Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. 342 (2013) (holding that Padilla v. Kentucky does not apply retroactively).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mo Idlibby, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Guillermo Rey De La Garza
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 5, 2018, denying her motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for her failure to appear for a hearing on June 27, 2005. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s findings of fact. The Immigration Judge found that the Notice to Appear (NTA) was personally served on the respondent on November 13, 2004, and contained the date, time, and location of the respondent’s June 27, 2005, hearing (IJ at 1; Exh. 1). Further, the Immigration Judge observed that the certificate of service on the NTA indicates that the respondent was provided oral notice in her native language of Spanish of the consequences of a failure to appear, and the respondent’s right index fingerprint is affixed thereto (Id.). Moreover, the NTA bears the respondent’s signature. Consequently, inasmuch as the respondent was personally served with the NTA containing the date, time, and location of her hearing, we conclude that the respondent received proper notice of her hearing. See Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 185 (BIA 2001) (stating that the entry of an in absentia order is authorized when the alien has been given written notice of the removal hearing); see Cruz-Diaz v. Holder, 388 F. App’x 429 (5th Cir. 2010); see also Chavez v. Holder, 343 F. App’x 955 (5th Cir. 2009); see Ojeda-Calderon v. Holder, 726 F.3d 669, 675 (5th Cir. 2013) (“Due process allows notice of a hearing to be given solely in English to a non-English speaker if the notice would put a reasonable recipient on notice that further inquiry is required.”). Nevertheless, the respondent did not appear, and the Immigration Judge ordered her removed in absentia.
 
On appeal, the respondent claims she has demonstrated exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. She claims that her attorney advised her not to appear at the immigration hearing and that he would take care of things for her (Respondent’s Brief).
 
*2 We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an ““exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. A motion to reopen alleging exceptional circumstances for a failure to appear at a removal hearing must be filed within 180 days of the order of removal, and only one such motion is allowed. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i) & 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent’s motion claiming that she did not appear at her hearing because of ineffective assistance by her former counsel, was untimely, as it was filed well beyond 180 days after the removal order was entered. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case lies, has recognized that equitable tolling may apply in “rare and exceptional circumstances,” United States v. English, 400 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir. 2005), and that a party seeking to toll a filing deadline must demonstrate diligence, Pacheco v. Rice, 966 F.2d 904, 906-07 (5th Cir. 1992).1
 
In Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016), the Fifth Circuit instructed the Board to apply the same equitable tolling standard that the court uses in other contexts, stating that under this standard, “a litigant is entitled to equitable tolling of a statute of limitations only if the litigant establishes two elements: (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently; and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.” Id. The Fifth Circuit explained further that the first element requires the litigant to establish that he pursued his rights with “reasonable diligence” and the second element requires the litigant to establish that an “extraordinary circumstance” beyond his control prevented him from complying with the applicable deadline. Id.
 
The respondent is not entitled to equitable tolling because she has not established that she has pursued her rights with reasonable diligence and that an extraordinary circumstance beyond her control prevented her from complying with the applicable deadline. The respondent has not indicated that she attempted to determine the status of her case with the Harlingen Immigration Court during the passage of over 13 years after she was ordered to appear in court in June 2005, nor that she consulted with any other attorneys between 2005 and 2018. The respondent also has not established that an extraordinary circumstance beyond her control prevented her from complying with the applicable deadline. We conclude that the respondent has not established that she is entitled to equitable tolling in this matter. See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d at 344.
 
*3 Further, we also conclude that the respondent has not established an exceptional circumstance herein to warrant the sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. The respondent’s purported eligibility for adjustment of status does not constitute an exceptional situation. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that “the power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”). The respondent was personally served with a NTA listing the time and place of her hearing and she was provided oral notice of her hearing date and the consequences of failing to appear (Exh. 1). The respondent has not established what efforts she took to determine the status of her removal proceeding after receiving the NTA almost 13 years before she filed her motion to reopen. We therefore decline to reopen proceedings sua sponte. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note on appeal that while the respondent has complied with the procedural prerequisites outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), the respondent did not expressly argue in her brief that her motion should be equitably tolled.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rev. John J. Garkowski, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Guillermo Rey de la Garza
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s October 11, 2017, decision. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen filed on August 29, 2017, seeking rescission of an in absentia order of deportation that was entered on March 22, 1996. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed an opposition to the motion, and has filed a brief opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An order of deportation issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to former section 242B(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed with the Immigration Judge either within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation if the alien demonstrates that he failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances (8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(1)) or at any time if the alien demonstrates she did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because she was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of her own (8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(2)).
 
The Order to Show Cause (OSC) was personally served on the respondent on December 31, 1995; the notice of hearing (NOH) was served by certified mail, and the record contains a signed receipt for the NOH (IJ (unpaginated); Exhs. 1, 3). Because the respondent received notice of her hearing, her motion to rescind was subject to the 180-day time limit, and the motion was untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(1). Moreover, the respondent took no action during the last 20 years to assert this claim for reopening and she has not explained why she waited until 2017 to file a motion to reopen. Her lack of diligence supports the conclusion that reopening is not warranted as a matter of discretion.
 
On appeal, the respondent also maintains that she is eligible to adjust her status because her U.S. citizen spouse has filed a petition on her behalf, which has been approved (Respondent’s Br. at 1). The formal rescission requirements need not be satisfied in certain circumstances where the respondent is eligible for relief that was unavailable at the time of the in absentia hearing and did not receive oral warnings in his/her native language regarding the bar to future discretionary relief that arises from a failure to appear. See generally Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998). However, the respondent received oral warnings in her native Spanish language (Exh. 1). In addition, the respondent’s in absentia deportation order was entered on March 22, 1996, and therefore, the motion was also filed long past the 90-day deadline for the filing of a motion to reopen seeking new relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b).
 
*2 Additionally, the DHS has amended the rules regarding provisional unlawful presence waivers to permit individuals with final removal orders to apply for provisional unlawful presence waivers in certain instances. See Expansion of Provisional Unlawful Presence Waivers of Inadmissibility, 81 Fed. Reg. 50,244, 50,275-76 (July 29, 2016); 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e) (4) (iv). Thus, the respondent does not need to have her removal proceedings reopened to be able to apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The respondent may request an administrative stay of removal from the DHS while any waiver or provisional waiver applications are pending before USCIS. 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a).
 
The respondent argues that she relied upon the advice of counsel telling her that once she paid bond and was released, immigration authorities were no longer interested in her (Respondent’s Br. at 1). However, the respondent has not identified that attorney; nor has she complied with any of the requirements to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
We find without merit the respondent’s appellate contention that she did not understand the proceedings because she did not understand English (Respondent’s Br. at 1). The OSC and Notification Requirement for Change of Address each contained instructions in both English and Spanish (Exhs. 1, 4).
 
While the respondent contends that her country conditions have worsened (Respondent’s Br. at 2), she has proffered no evidence to support that assertion. See Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013) (holding that removal proceedings conducted in absentia may be reopened where the alien seeks asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country conditions); see also Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247, 258 (BIA 2007) (explaining that it is the alien’s heavy burden to show that the proffered evidence is material, reflects changed conditions arising in the country of nationality, and supports a prima facie case for a grant of asylum).
 
While we sympathize with the respondent for wanting to remain in the United States after living here for many years, the Board is not empowered to grant relief from removal solely on equitable or humanitarian grounds. See Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734, 742 (BIA 1988).
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert B. Jobe, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent’s case is before the Board on remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Arreola-Arreola v. Sessions, 713 F. App’x 675 (9th Cir., Feb. 26, 2018). The Department of Homeland Security has not offered a brief on remand to the Board. Upon reconsideration of the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 5, 2013, decision, we will sustain the appeal, and terminate the proceedings.
 
The respondent is a 61-year-old native and citizen of Mexico who entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident on April 7, 1959, at the age of two. On October 6, 1998, the respondent was ordered removed to Mexico pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (1995) (alien convicted of an aggravated felony), based on his convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of sections 23152(b) and 23175 of the California Vehicle Code. The respondent waived appeal.
 
On December 26, 2012, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and terminate before the Immigration Judge. The respondent sought the exercise of the Immigration Judge’s authority to reopen and terminate the proceedings sua sponte in view his equities, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, and a change in law whereby the 1996 crime underlying his removability was determined not to be an aggravated felony. See United States v. Trinidad-Aquino, 259 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir. 2001); Montiel-Barraza v. INS, 275 F.3d 1178 (9th Cir. 2002). On March 13, 2015, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 5, 2013, decision denying his motion. The Ninth Circuit granted the respondent’s petition, finding that the Board erred in dismissing the appeal, and remanded the record to the Board.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under the de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent’s motion did not demonstrate an exceptional situation to warrant sua sponte reopening. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(a)(1). However, a fundamental change in law may qualify as an exceptional situation that merits the exercise of discretion to reopen a case sua sponte. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999). In view of the particular circumstances of this case, including the change in law affecting the basis of the respondent’s removability, we find that reopening sua sponte reopening was warranted. See also Sessions v. Dimaya, 138 S. Ct. 1204 (2018). Therefore, the Board’s March 13, 2015, decision will be vacated and the respondent’s appeal will be sustained. The motion to reopen will be granted, and the proceedings will be terminated without prejudice.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The Board’s March 13, 2015, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained and the motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The removal proceedings are terminated without prejudice.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert Kenneth Hoffman, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before us on February 28, 2018, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reconsider this decision on March 30, 2018. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion.
 
In his October 27, 2016, decision, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an aggravated felon defined in section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F) (Exh. 1). Specifically, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s conviction under Texas Penal Code § 38.04 did not qualify as a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. § 16(a), because it does not have as an element, “the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force” (IJ at 10). See United States v. Sanchez-Ledezma, 630 F.3d 447, 450 (5th Cir. 2011). However, the Immigration Judge found, pursuant to the modified categorical approach, that the respondent’s conviction for evading arrest under Texas Penal Code § 38.04 created her removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) because, by its nature, the respondent’s offense “involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used” pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 16(b) (IJ at 11).
 
In her motion to reconsider, the respondent correctly argues that the United States Supreme Court recently held that 18 U.S.C. § 16(b), as incorporated into the Immigration and Nationality Act, is unconstitutionally vague. See Sessions v. Dimaya, 138 S. Ct. 1204 (April 17, 2018). The respondent argues that the record should be remanded because it is now apparent that her previous counsel failed to properly contest her removability, and because she is now eligible for relief from removal. We need not address this issue, because we find, alternatively, that due to the Supreme Court’s holding in Dimaya, the respondent’s sole ground of removability is no longer sustainable. Inasmuch as the respondent is no longer removable as charged, we will terminate the respondent’s proceedings without prejudice, and the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is granted, and the respondent’s proceedings are terminated without prejudice.

File: AXXX-XX1-305 - New York, NY
August 27, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael A. Areizaga, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On February 26, 2018, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen proceedings in which the Board dismissed her appeal on August 25, 2009. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely because it was filed more than 8 years after the Board’s final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). It is also number-barred, as it is the respondent’s second motion to reopen. However, the respondent contends that the attorney who represented her before the Immigration Judge provided her with ineffective assistance because he did not inform her that she could pursue a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(d)(11) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(11), or that her husband could file a visa petition on her behalf, and because he did not provide briefing or evidence in this regard (Motion, Tab A at 2-3). Matter of Compean, 21 I&N Dec. 51 (BIA 1995). She also seeks sua sponte reopening. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
The noted statutory time and number limitations may be excused if a respondent demonstrates that she had ineffective assistance of counsel. Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 130 (2d Cir. 2008); Jin Bo Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154, 159-60 (2d Cir. 2006); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent contends that she has substantially complied with the procedural requirements for such a claim, as enumerated in Matter of Lozada (Motion at 7; Tab A). However, to warrant equitable tolling the respondent also must “demonstrate ... that [she] has exercised due diligence in pursuing [her claim].” Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 135 (2d Cir. 2000). In addition, she must demonstrate that she was prejudiced by counsel’s actions; i.e., that ““counsel’s performance was so ineffective ... [that it] impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing in violation of the Fifth Amendment due process clause.” Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d 879, 882 (2d Cir. 1994).
 
In determining whether the respondent exercised due diligence, we consider ““whether and when the ineffective assistance ‘[was], or should have been, discovered by a reasonable person in the situation.’ Then, petitioner bears the burden of proving that [she] has exercised due diligence in the period between discovering the ineffectiveness of [her] representation and filing the motion to reopen.” Jian Hua Wang v. BIA, 508 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d at 134). The respondent must demonstrate that she exercise “due diligence” in pursuing her claim “during the entire period [she] ... seeks to toll.” Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d at 132.
 
*2 The respondent has not demonstrated that she exercised the requisite due diligence. The record reflects that the Immigration Judge continued proceedings on April 9, 2007, so that the respondent could file a visa petition package with the court (Tr. at 184-87). However, when the hearing convened almost 5 months later, no visa petition had been filed (Tr. at 191-92). Moreover, the record reflects that there was extensive discussion at her hearing about the respondent’s eligibility to file for adjustment of status, and pursue a waiver of inadmissibility (Tr. at 192-211). As such, the respondent was aware that she could pursue both adjustment and a waiver as of the time of her December 20, 2007, hearing.
 
In arguing that she exercised due diligence, the respondent notes that she retained a different attorney to file and brief her appeal. Although this attorney did not raise any arguments pertaining to her eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility, the respondent has neither alleged, nor perfected, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against him. Twum v. INS, 411 F.3d 54 (2d Cir. 2005). This is true despite the fact that the DHS specifically raised the issue of whether the respondent was eligible for a section 212(d)(11) waiver of inadmissibility in its brief on appeal (DHS Br. at 18). Although she indicates that this attorney did file a visa petition on her behalf which was ultimately granted, the respondent has not detailed the representational agreement she had with him, as required (Motion, Tab C). Id. She also has not explained what, if any, actions she took with respect to her claim following the Board’s 2009 adverse decision.1 As such, we find that she has not demonstrated the requisite due diligence. Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d at 135.
 
In addition, the respondent has not demonstrated that she was prejudiced by counsel’s actions, as required. To demonstrate prejudice, or to otherwise succeed on a motion to reopen, the respondent must establish a prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief sought; i.e., adjustment of status and a section 212(d)(l 1) waiver of inadmissibility. See Rabiu v. INS, 41 F.3d at 882-83; see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104 (1988). In dismissing the respondent’s appeal, the Board upheld the Immigration Judge’s alternate basis for denying her application for adjustment of status, in the exercise of discretion (BIA at 3, ftnt. 1; IJ at 14). The record reflects that the Immigration Judge found the respondent not credible, and that she had lied to federal agents, a District Court judge, and the Immigration Judge (IJ at 7-14). The respondent has neither addressed, nor rebutted, the Immigration Judge’s findings. As both adjustment of status and a waiver of inadmissibility are discretionary forms of relief, the respondent has not shown that she was prejudiced by former counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance.
 
*3 In closing, we recognize that the respondent has alternatively asked that her proceedings be reopened sua sponte, citing various humanitarian factors in this regard (Motion at A, pgs. 1-5). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). However, an individual’s acquisition of equities after remaining in the United States for many years, and the resulting hardships to that person spouse or children, following a removal order are, unfortunately, common situations. The authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte, however, is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The respondent bears the burden to show exceptional circumstances supporting sua sponte reopening. See Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000). As the respondent has not met her burden in this case, sua sponte reopening is not warranted.
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

The respondent also argues that she was diligent in pursuing her claim as the visa petition filed on her behalf remained pending until it was approved on July 2, 2015. However, the fact that a visa petition was pending, without more, is insufficient to demonstrate due diligence. We also note that there is no evidence that respondent’s second counsel was involved in the filing of this visa petition, as the notice was addressed to the petitioner, her husband, and not former counsel. Furthermore, the respondent had not explained what action she undertook since the visa petition was approved, until the filing of the instant motion, with respect to her claim.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steve Tanijo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
 
*1 This case is before the Board pursuant to a March 13, 2018, order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which granted the Government’s motion to remand. In its motion, the Government sought remand for the Board to reconsider the respondent’s removability in light of the subsequent vacating of the respondent’s conviction by the state court. Attached to the Government’s motion is a copy of the May 23, 2017, court order from the King County Superior Court, Washington, vacating the respondent’s conviction due to ineffective assistance of counsel resulting in a constitution violation pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010).
 
Subsequently, the respondent filed a motion to dismiss to which the Department of Homeland Security has filed no response. Attached to the respondent’s motion is a copy of the May 23, 2017, court order. The respondent’s conviction is no longer valid for immigration purposes. Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003) (holding that a conviction vacated by the criminal court based upon a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings is no longer a valid conviction for immigration purposes). As the respondent was charged with removability solely based upon this now vacated conviction, the motion will be granted and proceedings terminated.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
ORDER: The motion to dismiss is granted and the respondent’s removal proceedings are hereby terminated.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lawrence E. Rushton, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Vietnam, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 7, 2017, denying her motion to reopen removal proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on September 13, 2016. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not file a response to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be reopened and remanded for further proceedings.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an order of removal entered in absentia may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 722-23 (BIA 1999).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that she demonstrated a lack of notice and exceptional circumstances for not attending the scheduled removal hearing due to ineffective assistance by her prior attorney (Respondent’s Br. at 5-7). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent claims that her prior counsel did not inform her that she was placed in removal proceedings and that she was required to appear at her removal hearing, scheduled to be held on September 13, 2016 (Id.). Ineffective assistance of counsel may constitute such an exceptional circumstance if the ineffective assistance results in an alien’s failure to appear at her hearing. Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 2014); Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605, 609 (5th Cir. 2006).
 
*2 The Notice to Appear, and the Notice of Hearing which scheduled her removal hearing for September 13, 2016, were mailed to the respondent’s prior attorney (Exhs. 1-3). The respondent did not appear at the hearing and was ordered removed in absentia. However, the record shows that respondent’s prior attorney entered an appearance to represent the respondent before the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) only - the Notice of Entry is the Form G-28, and only the first page of the Form is in the record (Exh. 3). The incomplete Form G-28 contains the respondent’s prior attorney’s address, 11310 Bellaire, Suite 148, Houston, Texas 77072, but does not reflect whether the respondent’s address was also provided (Id.). Furthermore, the Notice of Hearing was mailed to an incorrect address, i.e., suite #14 and not #148 as provided on the Form G-28 and on the Notice to Appear (Exhs. 1-3).1 While notice to counsel is sufficient to establish notice to the respondent, her prior attorney did not represent her in removal proceedings. Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (notice to the alien’s attorney constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). We conclude that the mailing of the Notice of Hearing to the respondent’s prior counsel in proceedings before USCIS (not removal proceedings), combined with the mailing of the notice to an incorrect address establishes that she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act. Therefore, we will sustain the appeal, rescind the in absentia order of removal, reopen proceedings, and remand the record for further proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

The Notice to Appear references the suite number 148 and “Blvd.” as part of the prior counsel’s address. In contrast, the Form G-28 does not reference “Blvd” in providing the counsel’s address.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey B. Rubin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, appeals from the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated July 19, 2017, finding the respondent removable as charged. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent became a lawful permanent resident of the United States in 1994. In May of 2011, he left the United States for the Dominican Republic due to the death of his mother. He argues he intended to stay there 1 month, but due to grief and depression he remained there over 1 year, attempting to return on September 14, 2012. At this time, he attempted to enter the United States with a fraudulent stamp in his passport indicating he had not been absent from the United States for this length of time. The Immigration Judge found the respondent lacked credibility and had abandoned his lawful permanent resident status (IJ at 9-10). The respondent and his attorney were provided a deadline to file any applications for relief and they did not meet it (IJ at 11). On appeal, the respondent argues he was credible and appeared less so due to memory issues and that he did not abandon his lawful permanent resident status (Respondent’s Br. at 7-11). He also claims he did not commit fraud and did not abandon his applications for relief. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994).
 
Generally, to gain admission into the United States, an immigrant must present a valid, unexpired immigrant visa as well as a valid, unexpired passport or other travel document. See section 211(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1181(a). If a person fails to produce such documents, he or she is deemed inadmissible under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).
 
When an applicant for admission has a colorable claim to returning resident status, the Department of Homeland Security bears the burden to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant’s status has changed and he or she is not eligible for admission. See Katebi v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 463 (1st Cir. 2005); Matter of Huang, 19 I&N Dec. 749, 753 (BIA 1988); see also Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276 (1966); Matter of Rivens, 25 I&N Dec. 623 (BIA 2011). In order to qualify as a returning resident alien, an alien must be returning to an unrelinquished lawful permanent residence after a temporary visit abroad. Matter of Huang, 19 I&N Dec. at 749. A temporary visit abroad is one that is “relatively short, fixed by some early event, or” that “will terminate upon the occurrence of an event having a reasonable possibility of occurring within a relatively short period of time.” Katebi v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d at 466, quoting Chavez-Ramirez v. INS, 792 F.2d 932, 936-37 (9th Cir. 1986).
 
*2 The required intent is not one of ultimately returning to the United States, but, rather, an intent to return to a residence in the United States within a relatively short period of time from a temporary visit abroad. Katebi v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d at 466. The definition of “temporary” is not inflexible and varies in application depending upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case and is not defined in terms of elapsed time alone. See Katebi v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d at 466. Rather, the intention of the alien, when it can be ascertained, will control. Id.; Matter of Kane, 15 I&N Dec. 258 (BIA 1975). We have in the past ascertained an alien’s intention by examining the location of family ties, property holdings, and employment. Matter of Muller, 16 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1978); Matter of Quijencio, 15 I&N Dec. 95 (BIA 1974); see also Katebi v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d at 710.
 
The Immigration Judge’s findings regarding both the respondent’s intent in relation to his return to the United States and his life in the Dominican Republic are factual in nature. Thus, we review them for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We conclude the Immigration Judge’s factual findings are not clearly erroneous. The respondent first testified that he had no memory of when he left the United States and then stated that he left the country for, at the most, 1 month (Tr. at 42-71). Over a year later, he again appeared in Immigration Court, but this time he testified that he had left the United States for Puerto Rico due to the death of his mother and had remained there for over 1 year (Tr. at 110-18). He also recalled giving a friend his passport to have a date stamped in it indicting that he had been out of the United States for a shorter length of time (Tr. at 121-24). The Immigration Judge found this directly contradictory testimony to support an adverse credibility determination (IJ at 9-10).
 
The respondent argues he has memory problems, and was suffering from depression and stress due to the death of his mother (Respondent’s Br. at 7-9). He has submitted some documents supporting this claim and he takes medicine for the depression and memory (Exhs. 6, 7). The Immigration Judge considered this evidence but concluded it was not sufficient to overcome the adverse credibility determination (IJ at 9-10). The respondent’s mother died in 2011 and the hearing, when he first testified to not remembering his trip, was in 2014.1 The Immigration Judge is permitted to make reasonable inferences among the plausible possibilities and explanations for discrepancies in the record and he did so. See Matter of D-R-, 25 I&N Dec. 445, 455 (BIA 2011) (explaining that an Immigration Judge may make reasonable inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence in the record as a whole and is not required to accept respondent’s account where other plausible views of the evidence are supported by the record). There is no clear error in the Immigration Judge adverse credibility determination.
 
*3 Given this lack of credibility, the Immigration Judge did not credit the respondent’s claim that he had no intention of remaining in the Dominican Republic for as long as he did (IJ at 10). Although the respondent has children and grandchildren in the United States, he also has many relatives in the Dominican Republic. He testified to having no steady employment or property in the United States and to having paid no taxes since 2007 (IJ at 10). The record provides clear and convincing evidence that the respondent abandoned his lawful permanent resident status in the United States. See Katebi v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d at 466. Although the respondent testified that he intended to return to the United States within 1 month (Tr. at 111), an alien’s professed intent to return to the United States without more is not sufficient to support his claim. Matter of Huang, 19 I&N Dec. at 755. We acknowledge the respondent’s argument that his situation is different than the one found in Katebi (Respondent’s Br. at 11). Each case must be reviewed on its own facts, and, here, the Immigration Judge applied the appropriate standard.
 
In 2015, the respondent attempted to enter the United States with a fraudulent stamp in his passport indicating that he was not out of the country for as long as he had been (IJ at 10-11). He testified that a friend took his passport away from him for several days and obtained the stamps (Tr. at 121-23). No clear error exists in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent was not credible when he claimed he did not know the stamp was fraudulent (IJ at 10-11). We affirm the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent is removable as charged.
 
We further affirm the Immigration Judge determination that the respondent abandoned any applications for relief by not filing them in a timely manner (IJ at 11). The respondent was represented by an attorney from 2013 (Tr. 15), and both the respondent and his attorney were clearly informed of the August 1, 2016, deadline for filing any applications for relief (Tr. at 180-90). A new attorney took over representation on August 1, 2016, but no applications for relief were filed (IJ at 11). Although, at a hearing represented by the new attorney, the parties discussed the applicability of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (Tr. at 211), no attempt has been made to comply with the requirements it lays out for motions based on ineffective assistance of counsel (IJ at 11). The respondent testified that his conflict with his previous attorney was over the fees he was being charged (Tr. at 217). The respondent has not presented good cause for failing to timely file any applications for relief (Respondent’s Br. at 13-14).
 
The Immigration Judge properly found that the respondent, by not complying with the filing deadline provided, abandoned his opportunity to apply for relief (IJ at 11). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c); Moreta v. Holder, 723 F.3d 31, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2013); Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992); see also Matter of Interiano-Rosa, 25 I&N Dec. 264, 265-66 (BIA 2010) (concerning late filed documents). Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*4 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

James A. Jones
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s November 28, 2017, derision ordering her removed to Mexico. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) moves for summary affirmance. The record will be remanded.
 
We review the Immigration Judges’ findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3).
 
We find it necessary to remand the record for the preparation of a new decision as we conclude that the Immigration Judge’s November 28, 2017, order does not contain sufficient specificity for adequate review. See generally Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). On November 8, 2017, the respondent filed a motion for administrative closure.1 On November 13, 2017, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion in a form order and indicated that she could appear telephonically for the next hearing. According to the transcript, the respondent then appeared in person for her hearing on November 28, 2017 and renewed her request for administrative closure or in the alternative, for a continuance (Tr. at 11-18). The Immigration Judge denied said requests and ordered the respondent removed to Mexico in a form order (Tr. at 16-18). We conclude that this order does not contain sufficient findings of fact or conclusions of law for us to adequately review the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion for a continuance.2 We will therefore remand the record for the entry of a new decision.
 
Moreover, the respondent has filed a motion to remand on appeal, alleging she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel below and seeks the opportunity to apply for new relief. Considering the facts and circumstances of this, we will remand the record for the entry of a new decision. Upon remand, the Immigration Judge should consider the arguments raised in and the evidence submitted with the respondent’s motion to remand and afford the respondent the opportunity to apply for any available relief.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for the entry of a new decision.

The Immigration Judge previously administratively closed these proceedings on October 27, 2016. On September 11, 2017, the DHS moved to re-calendar proceedings, which the Immigration Judge granted on September 12, 2017.

The Attorney General recently determined that Immigration Judges and the Board do not have the general authority to administratively close cases. See Matter of Castro-Tum, 27 I&N Dec. 271, 287 n.9 (A.G. 2018) (stating that 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(iii) cannot be an independent source of authority for administrative closure because only the Attorney General may expand the authority of Immigration Judges or the Board).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christi J. Giddeon, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s January 11, 2018, decision denying her December 21, 2017, motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia after she did not appear for a scheduled removal hearing on July 18, 2017. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded only if the alien files a motion to reopen: (1) within 180 days after the date of the removal order in which he establishes that the failure to appear was because of “exceptional circumstances,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(e)(1); or (2) at any time where the alien establishes that she did not have proper notice of the hearing at which the removal order was entered. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act.
 
The respondent concedes that her attorney of record received proper notice of her July 18, 2017, hearing. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2. The respondent states in an affidavit that she did not receive a notification of the hearing that her attorney sent to her by mail and that she learned of the hearing at which she was ordered removed when she appeared at the Immigration Court on August 3, 2017, which she thought was her current hearing date. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 8. The respondent filed her motion to reopen on December 21, 2017.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings. Service on the respondent’s attorney of record constitutes proper service of a hearing notice. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c)(2), 1292.5(a); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985). The Immigration Judge therefore correctly concluded that reopening under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act is not warranted as notice was proper in this case. The respondent’s motion to reopen suggests that the attorney may have sent the hearing notice to an incorrect address. See Motion to Reopen at 2 ¶ 3 (stating that the attorney erred in sending the motion to 3608 rather than 3608½ NW 13th Street). However, the respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel or complied with any of the procedural requirements for establishing such a claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent alleges in her affidavit that she frequently experiences problems with her mail, but did not submit any evidence of this assertion and did not promptly file a motion to reopen upon learning that she had been ordered removed in absentia. Cf. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 666 (BIA 2008). We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen where the respondent did not establish that notice was improper or that exceptional circumstances existed excusing her failure to appear. See sections 240(b)(5)(C), (e)(1) of the Act.
 
*2 We further affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request that proceedings be reopened sua sponte as the respondent has not shown that exceptional circumstances are present in this case. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that sua sponte reopening is an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional circumstances). We note that the respondent may continue to seek an immigration benefit based on an approved visa petition from outside of the United States with the appropriate waivers. For the aforementioned reasons, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated January 12, 2018, denying his motion to reopen proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
In a decision dated January 8, 2015, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States to Jamaica. On that same date, the respondent married a United States citizen. On October 11, 2017, the respondent filed a motion to reopen to allow him an opportunity to file an application for adjustment of status based on the May 3, 2017, approval of the visa petition filed on his behalf by his wife.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen, filed 2 years and 9 months after the final administrative decision was rendered, is untimely (IJ at 2). Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The respondent asserts that the filing deadline should be tolled because he received ineffective assistance of counsel. In this regard, the respondent states that former counsel neglected to inform him that he could file a motion to reopen the removal proceedings within 90 days as a result of his marriage to a United States citizen who had filed an immediate relative visa petition on his behalf. The respondent reported in his affidavit that he told former counsel of the marriage the following day, and former counsel, retained by the respondent’s wife, filed a visa petition based on that marriage on February 26, 2015. The respondent provided evidence that a complaint was filed with New York’s Attorney Grievance Committee and states that a copy of such complaint was sent to his former attorney.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion because he found that even if the respondent’s former counsel had acted to his detriment, the respondent did not act with due diligence (IJ at 3-4). Ali v. Gonzales, 448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir. 2006); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006). The respondent had already received numerous continuances, and he was not eligible for relief from removal when the Immigration Judge issued his January 8, 2015, decision. The visa petition filed on the respondent’s behalf was approved on May 3, 2017. Although the respondent was aware a final order of removal had been entered against him, he did not file the motion to reopen until October 11, 2017, after he had been taken into immigration custody (IJ at 4).
 
*2 The respondent asserts on appeal that the time from January 8, 2015, when he was ordered removed until May 3, 2017, when his visa petition was approved, should be equitably tolled (Respondent’s Br. at 12). However, even if such time period were tolled, the respondent waited another 161 days to file his motion to reopen. The respondent has not shown that he was diligent during this time period when he believed his proceedings could be reopened as a result of the approval of his visa petition. Accordingly, even if ineffective assistance of counsel were found and the period for filing a motion to reopen is tolled from January 8, 2015, to May 3, 2017, reopening is not warranted because the respondent waited another 161 days to file his motion to reopen.
 
Nor has the respondent shown that application of the extraordinary remedy of sua sponte reopening is warranted. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The respondent has proffered additional evidence on appeal. However, we do not consider evidence submitted for the first time on appeal, and a remand is unwarranted where the additional evidence would not change the result in the case. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(iv), 1003.2(c)(1); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert K. Lacy, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s January 10, 2018, decision denying her motion to reopen removal proceedings and rescind an October 24, 2006, in absentia removal order. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board must defer to the Immigration Judge’s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated that her untimely motion to reopen should be granted due to ineffective assistance of counsel (IJ at 1-2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (an order of removal entered in absentia may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances). The respondent concedes that she received the notice of hearing informing her of the October 24, 2006, master calendar hearing (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 4, Tab F). She also concedes that she was in New York City on October 24, 2006, ready to attend her hearing, but received faulty advice from the American Immigrant Federation (AIF) that she would be detained and removed if she appeared (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 4-5; Tab H).
 
We acknowledge the evidence of record that the New York Attorney General shut down AIF in 2010 because it defrauded immigrants by providing, inter alia, unauthorized legal advice (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Tab G). However, even accepting that this constituted ineffective assistance, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent did not act with due diligence in pursuing her immigration case (IJ at 1-2). See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127 (2d Cir. 2008). The respondent turned 18 in 2008, and the action against AIF occurred in 2010. The respondent was aware of her removal proceedings, but did not seek current counsel until April 2017, after her marriage to a United States citizen. As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent has not adequately addressed her efforts to follow up on her immigration case in the 10 years between the 2006 in absentia order and 2017, when she filed her motion to reopen (IJ at 1-2). Under these circumstances, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not exercise due diligence in such a way that tolls the filing deadline for motions to reopen.
 
*2 We also agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s request to reopen her removal proceedings pursuant to his sua sponte authority (IJ at 2). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (explaining that proceedings may be sua sponte reopened where exceptional circumstances exist). We acknowledge that the respondent is the mother of three United States citizen children and the beneficiary of an approved I-130 petition filed on her behalf by her United States citizen husband (Respondent’s Br. at Tab G). However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has exclusive jurisdiction over the respondent’s application for adjustment of status because she is an arriving alien and does not qualify for the limited circumstances in which an Immigration Judge retains jurisdiction over adjustment of status applications. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1.1(q), 1001.1(q) (defining the term “arriving alien”); 8 C.F.R. §§ 245.2(a)(1) (setting forth the jurisdiction of the USCIS over adjustment applications for arriving aliens), 1245.2(a)(1)(ii) (setting forth the limited circumstances in which an Immigration Judge will have jurisdiction over the adjustment application of an arriving alien). Further, the respondent is not prohibited from pursuing her applications for adjustment of status and a provisional unlawful presence waiver (provided she is granted consent to reapply for admission) before USCIS even with an unexecuted administratively final order of removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(3)-(4).
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDEN
 
Tina Y. Song, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rod Wolthoff
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, has appealed the Immigration Judge decision dated March 5, 2018, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for her failure to appear for the hearing on October 31, 2002. The Department of Homeland Security has opposed the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The record reflects that the Notice to Appear was served personally on the respondent on August 14, 2002, and the respondent received oral, in the Spanish language, and written notice of the consequences of a failure to appear and of the requirement to notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever she changed her address or telephone number during the proceeding (Exh. 1). The notice of hearing was sent to the address provided by the respondent and it was not returned to the Immigration Court as undeliverable by the postal service. The respondent did not appear for the hearing on October 31, 2002, and the Immigration Judge issued an in absentia order of removal.
 
There is a receipt presumption for notices sent by regular mail, which “is weaker than that accorded to notice sent by certified mail.” Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 673 (BIA 2008). We consider all relevant evidence, including circumstantial evidence, offered to rebut the presumption. Relevant factors include the following: “(1) the respondent’s affidavit; (2) affidavits from family members or other individuals who are knowledgeable about the facts relevant to whether notice was received; (3) the respondent’s actions upon learning of the in absentia order, and whether due diligence was exercised in seeking to redress the situation; (4) any prior affirmative application for relief, indicating that the respondent had an incentive to appear; (5) any prior application for relief filed with the Immigration Court or any prima facie evidence in the record or the respondent’s motion of statutory eligibility for relief, indicating that the respondent had an incentive to appear; (6) the respondent’s previous attendance at Immigration Court hearings, if applicable; and (7) any other circumstances or evidence indicating possible nonreceipt of notice.” Matter of M-R-A, 24 I&N Dec at 673-74.
 
*2 The Immigration Judge correctly determined that based on all of the evidence in this matter, the respondent has not rebutted the weaker presumption of delivery (IJ at 2).1 See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 674-75; see also Li v. Holder, 402 Fed. Appx. 923, 924 (5th Cir. 2010) (holding that an alien’s failure to provide a current address precludes the alien from obtaining rescission of an in absentia order of removal). Specifically, as noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent did not provide an affidavit or any other evidentiary material stating that she did not receive the notice of hearing (IJ at 2). Moreover, the respondent did not show that she had an incentive to appear at her hearing. In addition, the notice of hearing was sent to the most recent address provided by the respondent and was not returned by the postal service as undeliverable. Furthermore, the respondent waited over 15 years, until after she became eligible for an alternative form of relief, to file a motion to reopen. These factors outbalanced her claim that she did not receive any notice.
 
Regarding the respondent’s request to reopen to adjust her status based on an approved I-130 visa petition, in Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998), the Board held that an alien may reopen for purposes of pursuing previously unavailable relief in circumstances where she was not given oral warnings in her native language of the consequences of failing to appear at a deportation hearing and where the motion complies with the general time limits governing motions to reopen. See also Matter of Monges, 25 I&N Dec. 246 (BIA 2010). Neither condition is satisfied here.
 
To the extent that the respondent is alleging ineffective assistance by her former attorney, we note that she has not complied with any of the evidentiary requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).2 See also Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, 666 F.3d 948, 953 (5th Cir. 2012) (court requires strict Lozada compliance). Moreover, the respondent has not established that she was prejudiced by her former counsel’s actions. See De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir. 2004) (noting that “an alien must make an initial showing of substantial prejudice” to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
To the extent that the respondent has submitted new evidence with her appeal, we generally cannot consider any new evidence proffered on appeal. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). The additional documentation here is not sufficiently material so as to warrant a remand for its consideration.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

1

On appeal the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by applying a strong presumption of the delivery of the notice of hearing (Respondent’s Br. at 3). However, a review of the record indicates that the Immigration Judge properly determined that the respondent did not rebut the weaker presumption of delivery (IJ at 2).

2

Under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 637, a motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be supported by an affidavit, reflect whether a complaint had been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and include a response to the allegations by former counsel or report counsel’s failure or refusal to respond. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
CM Boston Cote, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on January 16, 2018, when we dismissed the respondents’ appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of their applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture and declined to remand their proceedings for voluntary departure or adjustment of status. The respondents have filed a timely motion to reconsider and request for a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The motion and stay will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondents’ motion is both a motion to reconsider and a motion to reopen. A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based upon the previous factual record, whereas a motion to reopen seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57-58 (BIA 2006). Here, the respondents challenge the decisions of the Board and the Immigration Judge and additionally allege ineffective assistance of their former counsel.
 
We first address that aspect of the motion requesting reconsideration. A party seeking reconsideration requests that the original decision be reexamined in light of alleged legal or factual errors, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. at 56; Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). Here, the respondents largely raises the same or similar arguments in the motion to reconsider as were raised in their prior appeal brief. We considered those arguments and found them unpersuasive when viewed within the record as a whole before we dismissed their appeal and denied their motion to remand. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. at 58 (stating that “a motion to reconsider is not a process by which a party may submit, in essence, the same brief presented on appeal . . .”). Disagreement with the result is not sufficient. Therefore, the motion to reconsider is denied.
 
The respondents’ motion is also in the nature of a timely motion to reopen. Applicable regulations provide that a motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, a movant must satisfy the “heavy burden” of establishing that if the proceedings were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must show that competent counsel would have acted otherwise and that the alien was prejudiced. See Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 To the extent that the respondents are attempting to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, they have not complied with any of the Lozada1 procedural requirements. See Matter of Zmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87, 94-95 (BIA 2007) (finding that the alien satisfied the concerns underlying the Lozada requirements by complying with the first two steps). Regardless, the respondents have not demonstrated that they were prejudiced by their prior counsel’s actions or inactions. See Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605, 609 (5th Cir. 2006) (rejecting claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on failure to pursue a discretionary waiver of relief from removal).
 
The respondents seek reopening to apply for adjustment of status or voluntary departure. However, the respondents are not eligible to adjust under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1155(a), as they were not inspected and admitted into the United States (see Exh. 1; IJ at 1-2). Moreover, despite the assertions in their motions, the respondents are not charged as arriving aliens (Compare Motion at with Exh. 1). Therefore, even if the visa petition is ultimately approved, the respondents would need to seek a provisional waiver of their unlawful presence in anticipation of consular processing. As we noted in our previous decision, such a waiver could be sought without reopening the proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(iv). Further, as we mentioned in our prior decision, the respondents are not eligible for voluntary departure because they were not present in the United States for 1 year immediately preceding the issuance of the Notice to Appear (Decision of the Board, at 1). See section 240B(b)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b)(1)(A); Matter of Arguelles, 22 I&N Dec. 811, 816 (BIA 1999).
 
As there is no relief immediately available to the respondents in reopened removal proceedings, they have not demonstrated prejudice from counsel’s actions or omissions such that they have established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. As such, the respondents’ motion is insufficient to meet their “heavy burden” of showing that it is likely that the result would change if the proceedings were reopened. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. at 464. Therefore, we do not find that they have met their burden of showing that reopening of these proceedings is warranted.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
*3 ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

Matter of Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. at 637, requires a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim be accompanied by: “(1) an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement with former counsel concerning what action would be taken and what counsel did or did not represent in this regard; (2) proof that the alien notified former counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance and allowed counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) if a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities is claimed, a statement as to whether the alien filed a complaint with any disciplinary authority regarding counsel’s conduct and, if a complaint was not filed, an explanation for not doing so.”).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tom Youngjohn, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mark Hardy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on February 25, 2015, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s September 15, 2014, decision that denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order entered against him on October 10, 2006. On February 22, 2018, the respondent filed a motion with the Board requesting reopening based upon a claim that he received ineffective assistance from the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Judge. He specifically alleges that former counsel failed to provide effective representation with regard to a motion to reopen the proceedings that was filed with Board. The respondent claims that the motion was granted and the case remanded to the Immigration Judge. However, former counsel failed to notify him of the remand, resulting in an in absentia order of removal.
 
The record of proceedings does not reflect that the Board previously reopened these proceedings, and a review of internal agency records confirms that no such order was issued. The procedural history of this case, as reflected in the previous decisions of the Immigration Judge and this Board, is that the respondent was aware of the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order of removal because prior counsel requested and was permitted to review the record of proceedings in 2009 to confirm entry of the order in contemplation of the filing a motion to reopen. The respondent eventually filed the motion to reopen five years later, on August 22, 2014, claiming that he never received notice of his removal hearing. The Immigration Judge and this Board both concluded that, even assuming lack of notice, the respondent failed to act with due diligence in pursuing reopening. The Immigration Judge found, and this Board agreed, that there was no evidence to corroborate the respondent’s claim of non-receipt in any event, and reopening based upon lack of notice was therefore not warranted. The respondent’s appeal was dismissed and nothing further occurred until the filing of the instant motion.
 
The respondent did not seek reconsideration of the Board’s decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent failed to establish non-receipt of the hearing notice for his 2006 removal hearing. We find no reason to revisit the issue.
 
The respondent’s current motion based on former counsel’s alleged failure to inform him that this Board ordered the proceedings reopened is without merit because we never issued such an order. Inasmuch as the respondent cannot demonstrate prejudice arising from circumstances that never occurred, the respondent’s motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance will be denied. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (an alien asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must demonstrate prejudice); see also Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793-94 (9th Cir. 2005) (stating that an alien must demonstrate that prior counsel’s performance may have affected the outcome of the proceedings).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Theodore J. Murphy, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals the Immigration Judge’s July 9, 2014, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings, in which he was ordered removed in absentia.1 The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review issues of law, discretion, or judgment de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. We concur with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not show that he is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel (IJ at 1). Notwithstanding the respondent’s allegations on appeal, the Immigration Judge appropriately gave significant weight to prior counsel’s detailed refutation of the respondent’s allegations of error as well as the Disciplinary Counsel of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania’s dismissal of the respondent’s complaint against his prior counsel (IJ at 1; Motion at Tab H). While the respondent continues to assert he was not given adequate notice of his hearing, we find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s reliance on the attorney’s detailed discussion of his interactions with the respondent (IJ at 1). Nor do we find clear error with the Immigration Judge’s determination that prior counsel directly notified the respondent of the time and location of the hearing (IJ at 1). Under the circumstances, we are not persuaded of any error with the representation, much less prejudice.
 
Additionally, the respondent did not meet his heavy burden of showing that his motion fell within the exception to the time limit for motions to reopen to apply for asylum or withholding of removal based on changed circumstances or changed country conditions “arising in the country of nationality.” Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). In order to prevail on his motion, the respondent was required to produce evidence that was material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at his previous hearing before the Immigration Judge. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of Act, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). He was also required to demonstrate his prima facie eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal, to wit, that his new evidence would likely alter the result of his case. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988). The respondent failed to demonstrate that reopening was warranted. Instead, the motion included evidence of past and ongoing conditions of crime in Guatemala.
 
*2 Even if the motion were deemed to have established changed country conditions, the motion would not succeed since it did not establish the respondent’s prima facie eligibility for relief. See Matter of Gutierrez, 21 I&N Dec. 479, 482 (BIA 1996). Specifically, the respondent indicates in his affidavit that he fears that gangs or people from the neighboring municipality will target him for persecution in Guatemala because they think he has money or want his family’s land (Motion at Tab C). Being targeted for mistreatment and extortion by criminal elements in Guatemala would not constitute persecution on account of his political opinion or membership in a particular social group. See Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 335, 338-39 (A.G. 2018); Matter of A-M-E- & J-G-U-, 24 I&N Dec. 69, 76 (BIA 2007) (recognizing that being a victim of criminal extortion is not persecution on account of a protected ground under the Act); see also Matter of C-A-, 23 I&N Dec. 951 (BIA 2006), clarified by Matter of W-G-R, 26 I&N Dec. 208 (BIA 2014), and Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227 (BIA 2014). Nor did the motion establish prima facie eligibility for protection under the CAT, i.e., that it is more likely than not that the respondent will face torture by or with the acquiescence (to include the concept of willful blindness) of a member of the government of Guatemala upon return to that country. Therefore, the respondent’s motion for reopening for the purpose of applying for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT was properly denied.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: SALEH ALI AL-ASHMALI
File: AXXX XX9 378 - Charlotte, NC

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Fleta Christina Sabra
Accredited Representative
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Susan Lecker
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 In a decision dated January 9, 2018, the Board upheld an Immigration Judge’s decision denying in discretion the respondent’s application for a fraud waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H). The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen these proceedings. To the extent that he challenges our last decision, his motion is also in the nature of a timely motion to reconsider. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991) (providing that the nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard). The respondent has also filed a request for a stay of removal, which we denied in an order issued on June 26, 2018.1 The motions to reopen and reconsider, which remain pending and are opposed by the Department of Homeland Security, will be denied.
 
In the instant motion, the respondent argues that the Board and the Immigration Judge overlooked evidence pertaining to conditions in his native country of Yemen that would be adverse to his family, medical evidence of one of his United States citizen children, and other factors relevant to discretion (Motion to Reopen at 8-15, 36-44). He also accuses the Immigration Judge of bias by “t[aking] over much of the questioning,” and claims that the Immigration Judge unfairly “orchestrated the consequence where [his] and his ex-wife’s cases would be heard [together].” (Id at 19, 51).2
 
The respondent further argues that reopening is warranted based on ineffective assistance of former counsel, and that the Board erred in finding that he failed to comply with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for raising such a claim on his direct appeal (Motion to Reopen at 29-36, 52-55). He accuses former counsel of (1) committing an ethical violation by discussing his case “ex parte” with the Immigration Judge and DHS counsel outside of his presence; (2) coaching him to lie at his hearing and then ridiculing him to the Immigration Judge; (3) failing to submit evidence pertaining to one of his United States citizen child’s Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD); and (4) refusing to make the respondent’s criminal attorney accountable for allowing him to plead guilty to a crime that, unbeknownst to him, would have adverse immigration consequences (Id. at 15-25, 27-39).
 
Ultimately, the respondent wishes to seek reopening to apply for cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a), as well as protection under the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16-1208.18.3
 
*2 To the extent the respondent seeks reconsideration of our last decision, he has failed to identify any error of fact or law in our decision that would warrant its reconsideration. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 56-58 (BIA 2006). We are satisfied that the Immigration Judge and the Board fully and properly reviewed the respondent’s case under the applicable legal precedents. While we acknowledged his numerous positive equities in our last decision, we remain persuaded that the respondent’s significant adverse factors - namely, his numerous false statements to the DHS and to the Immigration Court to obtain immigration benefits over a 15-year period, outweigh his positive equities (Board decision dated Jan. 9, 2018, at 2-3). The respondent does not merit discretionary relief.
 
Moreover, upon review of the record, we are unpersuaded that the Immigration Judge was biased against the respondent or otherwise conducted the hearing in a manner that did not comport with due process. See section 240(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(1) (giving immigration judges authority to ““interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien and any witnesses”); Rusu v. INS, 296 F.3d 316, 321-22 (4th Cir. 2002) (providing that alien must be ““accorded an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner, i.e., ... [to] receive a full and fair hearing on [her] claims”). The Immigration Judge’s conduct during the hearing fell short of displaying a ““deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible [.]” Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994).
 
We are also unpersuaded that reopening is warranted based on ineffective assistance of counsel. To prevail on such a claim, in addition to complying with certain procedural requirements, an alien must demonstrate that he was prejudiced as a result of his counsel’s ineffectiveness. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 640 (holding that alien must also show that she was prejudiced by counsel’s actions). The respondent has made no such showing here.
 
Initially, we are unpersuaded that the respondent’s former counsel committed any ethical violations by discussing the case with the Immigration Judge, in DHS counsel’s presence, at the conclusion of the proceedings. As an officer of the court, the respondent’s former counsel would have been subject to discipline for knowingly and with reckless disregard offering false evidence. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.102(c). The respondent continued to perjure himself throughout these proceedings, after the original fraud he committed before the DHS during his adjustment and naturalization processes (I.J. at 18; Tr. at 29.58. 222). Apparently, he perjured himself without former counsel’s urging or knowledge that he would do so (See Motion to Reopen. Attached E-Mail from Patrick Taurel dated Dec. 8. 2016. in which Taurel responded to the allegations against him). Once the respondent admitted to his continued perjury, we find it not only reasonable, but also incumbent upon former counsel, to have notified the Immigration Judge that he was unaware that his client was making false statements during his testimony. It is also not uncommon for an Immigration Judge to discuss an alien’s case with his counsel, along with DHS counsel, outside of the respondent’s physical presence.
 
*3 We also do not find that the respondent was prejudiced by former counsel’s failure to offer evidence of his child’s ADD. There is no indication that this evidence would likely have affected the outcome of these proceedings. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464. 473 (BIA 1992).
 
Moreover, the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s alleged failure to confront the respondent’s criminal counsel about any substantive or procedural defects of his plea in his criminal case. There is no indication that former counsel in these proceedings was retained for that purpose or agreed to assist the respondent in that regard. The respondent has also admitted in these proceedings that he committed the immigration fraud to which he ultimately pled guilty in his criminal proceedings.
 
As a final matter, we decline to reopen these proceedings to permit the respondent to pursue cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents or protection under the Convention Against Torture. The respondent has not shown his prima facie eligibility for either form of relief, such that reopening of these proceedings would be warranted.
 
Because the respondent committed fraud to procure adjustment of status, he is not an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for cancellation purposes. See 240A(a)(1) of the Act; see also Matter of Koloamatangi, 23 I&N Dec. 548, 551 (BIA 2003) (holding that an alien was ineligible for cancellation of removal for lawful permanent residents because he was “deemed, ab initio, never to have obtained lawful permanent resident status once his original ineligibility therefor [was] determined in [removal] proceedings”D’).
 
The respondent has also failed to make a prima facie showing that he will more likely than not face harm amounting to torture by or with the consent or acquiescence (including willful blindness) of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity, in the Yemeni government upon his repatriation. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16-1208.18. The respondent generally alleges that he will be tortured in Yemen because his brother and cousin were killed by Houthi rebels after the respondent informed United States immigration officials that Houthi rebels were attending his mosque (Petition For Convention Against Torture filed Feb. 9, 2018, Attached Form I-589 & Accompanying Affidavit). The respondent’s generalized and conclusory statements in this regard are insufficient, without more, to make out a prima facie showing that he is eligible for protection under the Convention Against Torture. We acknowledge the difficult country conditions in Yemen, but evidence of adverse country conditions, without more, is insufficient to show that the respondent himself may more likely than not be tortured upon his repatriation. See generally 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16-1208.18.
 
*4 In view of the foregoing, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent has also filed a separate “motion to expedite” wherein he complains about conditions in his current detention facility that are adversely impacting his state of health. However, the Board and the Immigration Judges have limited jurisdiction and can grant only those forms of relief from removal that are expressly authorized by Congress. See Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734 (BIA 1988). We do not have any authority to instruct the DHS how to operate their detention facilities. To the extent that the respondent may be seeking a bond determination, we note that bond proceedings are separate and apart from removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(d). Any request for bond would have to be made in a separate proceeding.

2

The respondent’s ex-spouse, Hana Al-Barati (AXXX XXX XXX), is presently in separate removal proceedings. However, she testified on his behalf in these proceedings.

3

The respondent also alleges that he is eligible for suspension of deportation under former section 244(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254 (Brief in Support of Cancellation of Removal filed Feb. 16, 2018, at 9-13). However, the respondent is ineligible for suspension of deportation, which was abolished in 1996, because such relief is unavailable for aliens who, like the respondent, are in removal proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Armineh Ebrahimian, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Evagelia Stella Solomos
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of China, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s February 7, 2018, decision denying his motion to continue and deeming his application for asylum abandoned and requests that the record be remanded to the Immigration Judge to file his application for asylum. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge properly deemed the respondent’s claim for asylum abandoned (IJ at 3-4). See Makir-Marwil v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 681 F.3d 1227, 1235 (11th Cir. 2012) (“If an application for relief is not filed by the deadline set by the IJ, that ground for relief is deemed waived.”); Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549 (BIA 1992); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). The Immigration Judge adequately informed the respondent of the opportunity to file for asylum and the consequences of failure to timely file the application (IJ at 3-5; Tr. at 3-4, 7). As further discussed below, the respondent did not establish a persuasive basis for not timely filing his application.
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion for a continuance. An Immigration Judge “may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. The respondent sought a continuance to find a new attorney (Tr. at 8-9). The Immigration Judge noted that the Department of Homeland Security opposed a continuance (IJ at 5). Despite the respondent’s counsel’s failure to appear for the hearing, the respondent, through a Mandarin interpreter, was advised of the consequences of not filing his asylum application by February 7, 2018, and confirmed that he understood (Tr. at 3-4, 7).1 The respondent was also served with a hearing notice advising him of the same (IJ at 3-4; Jan. 10, 2018, Hearing Notice). The respondent appeared at his February 7, 2018, hearing without an application for relief. While the respondent claims he was unaware of his former counsel’s motion to withdraw, he indicated that he was looking for another attorney, and the Immigration Judge noted that a letter from his sponsor indicated the same (IJ at 4; Tr. at 7-8). Moreover, the respondent acknowledged his understanding of the consequences for failure to file an asylum application by February 7, 2018 (IJ at 3-5; Tr. at 3-4, 7). Under these circumstances, the respondent had not established that “good cause” existed to further continue these removal proceedings (Id). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Sanchez-Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807, 815 (BIA 2012) (recognizing that a continuance should not be granted where it is being sought “as a dilatory tactic to forestall the conclusion of removal proceedings”); see also Matter of Castro-Turn, 27 I&N Dec. 271, 287 (A.G. 2018) (noting regulatory authorization for continuances).
 
*2 Moreover, the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by the continuance denial, as he has not shown that he is prima facie eligible for asylum, and has not submitted an application for asylum on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (a motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation). Therefore, the respondent has not demonstrated that the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny him a continuance was in error or that he experienced prejudice as a result. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983) (noting that an alien must show that the denial of the continuance caused actual prejudice).
 
Likewise, the respondent’s request for a remand to apply for asylum is denied. Despite his claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel, the respondent does not persuasively explain why he could not timely filed his application before the Immigration Judge. Moreover, as noted above, he has not supported his request for a remand with his asylum application, and thus, he has not established prima facie eligibility for asylum. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); see also INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988); Najjar v. Ashcroft, 257 F.3d 1262, 1303 (11th Cir. 2001); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Therefore, we are unable to conclude whether any application for asylum is reasonably likely to succeed on the merits. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349, 357 (BIA 1998). Thus, the record will not be remanded.
 
Finally, to the extent the respondent asserts that his due process rights were violated in the proceedings below, we are unpersuaded. The respondent did not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in the admission of his application for asylum after the court-ordered deadline had run. See Tang v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 578 F.3d 1270, 1276 (11th Cir. 2009). Further, the respondent has not established that he suffered prejudice such that the outcome of these proceedings may have been affected by the Immigration Judge’s decision. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We do not address the merits of the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because the respondent did not comply with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005); Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1221-22 (11th Cir. 2003). We note that, despite the respondent’s claim of not receiving the Immigration Judge’s decision, the record shows that the respondent was served with the Immigration Judge’s summary order deeming the asylum application abandoned and ordering him removed to China, as well as being informed of his right to appeal the decision (Tr. at 10-12).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raed Gonzalez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 4, 2017, denying her motion to reopen removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on May 12, 2014. On August 11, 2014, the respondent through her former counsel, Mr. Mario Caballero, filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge alleging that she did not receive notice of her May 12, 2014, hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion in a decision dated November 28, 2014, finding that the respondent’s failure to appear at the May 12, 2014, hearing was due to her failure to provide an updated address with the Immigration Court. On June 28, 2017, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a second motion to reopen alleging that her new motion was subject to equitable tolling based on exceptional circumstances in the form of Mr. Caballero’s ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge denied the motion in a decision dated August 4, 2017, finding that while the respondent may have pursued her rights diligently, extraordinary circumstances were not present in this case because the respondent did not meet her burden of proof to show that Mr. Caballero’s representation was ineffective (IJ at 3).
 
On appeal, the respondent specifically contends that her former attorney, Mr. Caballero, provided ineffective assistance of counsel to her because he based the respondent’s first motion on an improper ground, i.e. a lack of notice claim (Respondent’s Br. at 4-5, 9-10). The respondent therefore argues that her second motion, filed more than 90 days after the entry of the final administrative order on May 12, 2014, should be equitably tolled based on extraordinary circumstances in the form of ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Br. at 7-10).
 
Generally, an alien may file one motion to reopen, which must be filed within 90 days after the entry of the final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Under the doctrine of equitable tolling the 90-day filing deadline can be excused if the respondent establishes that: 1) she has been pursuing her rights diligently, and 2) some extraordinary circumstance stood in her way and prevented a timely filing. Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016).
 
*2 Ineffective assistance of counsel may constitute extraordinary circumstances. See, e.g., Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). However, we agree with the Immigration Judge that equitable tolling is not warranted in this case because no extraordinary circumstances exist in the form of ineffective assistance of counsel (IJ at 3). The respondent did not fully comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), in order to reopen her proceedings based upon her claim of Mr. Caballero’s ineffective representation (IJ at 4-5). Specifically, the respondent’s affidavit did not set forth in detail the representation agreement she had with her former counsel (id.). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639 (requiring a motion to reopen to be “supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel...”) (emphasis added). The documents that the respondent alludes on appeal to do not attest in detail to the facts of the representation agreement at issue and only summarily explain that she retained Mr. Caballero to file a motion to reopen (Respondent’s Br. at 11-13; Respondent’s Second Motion to Reopen-Tabs E, J).
 
Furthermore, even if the respondent had met the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel in an immigration proceeding, the respondent must demonstrate “substantial prejudice” resulting from counsel’s performance. Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n. 2 (5th Cir. 2001). Proving prejudice requires that the petitioner make a prima facie showing that, absent counsel’s deficient performance, she would have been entitled to the relief she sought. Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994). The respondent has not met her burden of showing that she was prejudiced by actions from his prior attorney.
 
Although the respondent contends that her prior attorney did not submit an application for withholding of removal with the respondent’s motion to reopen, the respondent has not shown that she was prima facie eligible for withholding of removal (Respondent’s Br. at 10). To that end, although the respondent submitted an application for withholding of removal with her Second motion to reopen, the application is blank in a number of places, does not indicate upon what basis she is seeking withholding of removal, and did not include an affidavit from the respondent setting forth the basis of her claim for relief (IJ at 6; Respondent’s Second Motion to Reopen-Tab K).
 
*3 The respondent contends that a reasonable attorney would not have based a motion to reopen on the respondent not having received notice of the May 12, 2014, hearing as it should have been based on exceptional circumstances or on the Immigration Judge’s power to reopen a case sua sponte (Respondent’s Br. at 12). However, the respondent does not advance what those exceptional circumstances would have been. The respondent did not appear for her May 12, 2014, hearing because she did not update her address with the Immigration Court, which led to her not receiving notice of the hearing (IJ at 5; Respondent’s Br. at 4, 10)). As the Immigration Judge noted, this does not constitute an exceptional circumstance and the respondent’s motion is untimely (IJ at 3, 5). Further, we agree with the Immigration Judge that based on the totality of the circumstances, the respondent had not presented a truly exceptional situation that would have warranted sua sponte reopening (IJ at 5-6). Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
We disagree with the respondent’s contention that the Immigration Judge conflated his legal analysis regarding equitable tolling with the procedural and substantive requirements of a Lozada claim (Respondent’s Br. at 8). The Immigration Judge separately considered whether the respondent had complied with the Lozada requirements, and then considered whether the respondent had made out a prima facie case for relief.
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ray A. Ybarra Maldonado, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michael Schnitzer
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Administrative closure
 
*1 The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico. This matter was last before us on October 14, 2016, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s April 24, 2015, decision denying her motion to administratively close proceedings; and reinstated the Immigration Judge’s grant of the privilege of voluntary departure. This case is presently before us pursuant to a July 27, 2017, order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granting a motion to remand.1 The respondent has filed a post-remand brief. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2018). We review de novo all other issues, including issues of law, judgment, or discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The motion to remand provided that the Board would “further consider its conclusion that the respondent’s argument regarding administrative closure was moot because the Ninth Circuit vacated the district court’s preliminary injunction in Puente Arizona v. Arpaio, 821 F.3d 1098 (9th Cir. 2016).” Specifically, the motion noted that since the Board’s October 14, 2016, decision in the respondent’s case, the district court declared that Arizona is preempted from using documents submitted solely as part of the federal employment verification process for purposes of investigating or prosecuting violations of certain Arizona statutes, including the one under which the respondent was charged and convicted. See Puente Arizona v. Arpaio, No. CV-14-01356-PHX-DGC, 2017 WL 1133012, at *16 n.7, 17 (D. Ariz. Mar. 27, 2017).
 
With her post-remand brief, the respondent submitted evidence that her conviction for criminal impersonation was vacated pursuant to Puente Arizona v. Arpaio, No. CV-14-01356-PHX-DGC, 2017 WL 1133012 (Respondent’s Br. at 4, Tabs F, G). The respondent asserts on appeal that she would not be in removal proceedings if it were not for the conviction that has since been vacated, and the Immigration Judge did not properly consider all relevant factors outlined in Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012), in denying her motion to administratively close her removal proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 11-12).2
 
*2 Notably, Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. at 688, has been overruled since this case has been remanded, and we are without authority to grant administrative closure under the facts presented here (Respondent’s Br. at 11-12). See Matter of Castro-Turn, 27 I&N Dec. 271 (A.G. 2018). Furthermore, to the extent that the respondent seeks prosecutorial discretion, we observe that the record demonstrates that the DHS has declined to exercise prosecutorial discretion in the respondent’s case, and neither the Board nor the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction over issues of prosecutorial discretion. See Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348, 349-50 (BIA 1982).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event she fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, she shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c)(3)(iii), (e)(1)).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if she files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, she will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if she provides to the DHS such evidence of her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence the DHS deems sufficient that she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

We note that the motion to remand did not include any discussion related to the Board’s denial of the respondent’s due process violation assertions as well as her claim for ineffective assistance of counsel (see Motion to Remand at 1-2). Hence, although the respondent included arguments related to these matters in her brief, we conclude that they are no longer before us and we will not address them further in this decision (Respondent’s Br. at 14-18).

2

We note that the respondent’s post-conviction relief did not affect her removability as an alien present without being admitted or paroled, a charge that she conceded (IJ at 1-2; Tr. at 3; Exh. 1). See section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (2012).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jeffrey B. Rubin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Shayne R. Burnham
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Haiti, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of December 4, 2017, denying the respondent’s November 1, 2017, motion to reopen removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia on February 9, 2001. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a reply opposing the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent’s November 1, 2017, motion was the second one filed in these proceedings, it was filed over 16 years after she was ordered removed in absentia, and the Immigration Judge correctly found that the motion was time and numerically barred (IJ at 2). See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C) (providing that there is no deadline for rescinding an order entered in absentia where the issue is notice, and that an alien has 180 days to file a motion where the nonappearance was based on exceptional circumstances).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that she is eligible for equitable tolling of the time limits because she was misled by a person posing as a lawyer. However, the respondent has not shown that she complied with the requirements for bringing such a claim, as laid out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (1988). In particular, nothing in the record indicates that the respondent: (1) filed an affidavit setting forth the agreement that was entered into with this person with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations this individual did or did not make to her in this regard; (2) informed the former attorney or person of the allegations leveled against him/her; or (3) filed a complaint with any appropriate disciplinary authority. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1273 & n.6 (11th Cir. 2005) (explaining the Lozada requirements).
 
We find no merit to the respondent’s contention that since it was a non-attorney involved, she need not fulfill the Lozada requirements. See Montano Cisneros, 514 F.3d 1224, 1227 (11th Cir. 2008). Moreover, as the respondent raised the same issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in her October 29, 2001, motion and in his March 13, 2002, decision, the Immigration Judge found the respondent had not fulfilled the Lozada requirements, we agree with the DHS that the law of the case doctrine applies to the respondent’s repeated ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See United States v. Amedeo, 487 F.3d 823, 829 (11th Cir. 2007) (courts may readily dispose of repetitive, meritless claims that present the same claim already denied in a prior claim by applying the law of the case where appropriate).
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Beresford A. Landers, Jr., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Angel L. Fleming
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s October 29, 2017, decision denying her motion to reconsider. The respondent sought reconsideration of the Immigration Judge’s October 2, 2017, decision denying her motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order dated August 24, 2017. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(2). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal. The appeal will be sustained.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On December 2, 2016, the respondent, 13 years of age at the time, appeared before the Immigration Judge with present counsel. At the conclusion of that hearing, the Immigration Judge rescheduled the respondent’s case for a later date and waived the respondent’s appearance at future proceedings so that she could attend school (Dec. 2, 2016, Hearing Tr.). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.25(a). Counsel’s presence was not waived. The respondent’s case was ultimately rescheduled for August 24, 2017 (Mar. 7, 2017, Notice of Hearing). The respondent’s counsel did not appear for this hearing, and the Immigration Judge entered an in absentia removal order. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i).
 
The respondent filed a motion to reopen on August 29, 2017, claiming that reopening is warranted based on “exceptional circumstances.” Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act. Although not explicitly framed as such, the exceptional circumstance relied on by the respondent is ineffective assistance of counsel. See Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir. 2008) (providing that ineffective assistance of counsel may amount to an exceptional circumstance). The respondent states that the proceedings should be reopened and the removal order rescinded due to counsel’s failure to appear at the hearing (Respondent’s Br.), which counsel claims resulted from unforeseen travel delays on the date of the hearing.
 
In an October 2, 2017, decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, concluding, without additional explanation, “no exceptional circumstance for the respondent’s failure to appear.” (Emphasis added). On October 19, 2017, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider pointing out the fact that the respondent herself was not required to attend the hearing because her presence had been excused.1 See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.25(a). In an October 29, 2017, decision, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reconsider, explaining that “neither the respondent nor counsel were present” at the hearing and that “no exceptional circumstance” had been established. The present appeal ensued.
 
*2 A motion to reopen or reconsider based on ineffective assistance of counsel requires “(1) an affidavit . . . detail[ing] the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken . . ., (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities . . . and if not, why not.” Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 637 (BIA 1988). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has found it reasonable to demand an alien claiming ineffective assistance of counsel to substantially comply with these procedural requirements. See Dakane v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005); Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir. 2003).
 
The motion to reopen is supported by an affidavit from counsel, detailing the circumstances surrounding his failure to appear at the hearing. Furthermore, counsel’s failure to appear at the hearing, which amounts to deficient performance, is plain on the face of the administrative record. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000) (“[W]here ‘the facts are plain on the face of the administrative record, the requirements of Lozada are not dispositive.”D’ (citation omitted)), as quoted in Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d at 1222. There is no dispute that counsel missed a hearing he was scheduled to appear at and, in doing so, caused the respondent to be ordered removed in absentia at a hearing she herself was not required to attend. While we share in the dissent’s point that counsel should have self-reported his conduct to relevant bar authorities to satisfy the bar complaint requirement under Matter of Lozada, there is no indication of collusion between the minor respondent and counsel in this case. See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 604 (BIA 1996) (noting that the purpose of the bar complaint requirement is to “protect against possible collusion between counsel and the alien client”). On this record, the purpose of Matter of Lozada is sufficiently satisfied.
 
The ineffectiveness of the respondent’s counsel in this case constitutes an exceptional circumstance and was the cause of the respondent’s failure to appear. The respondent, thus, met her burden of establishing that rescission of the in absentia order and reopening of proceedings were warranted.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The August 24, 2017, in absentia order is rescinded, this matter is reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.
 
Joan B Geller
FOR THE BOARD
DISSENTING OPINION: Garry D. Malphrus, Board Member
The issue addressed by the majority--whether counsel’s absence from the hearing constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel--was neither presented to nor considered by the Immigration Judge. As this argument was not advanced below, the proper procedure for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has not been followed. See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 637 (BIA 1988). In particular, there is no indication that relevant bar authorities have been alerted of counsel’s conduct in missing the hearing. See id. (providing that a motion claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must “reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities . . . and if not, why not”).
 
This bar complaint requirement serves the important purpose of “protect[ing] against possible collusion between counsel and the alien client.” Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 604 (BIA 1996). I do not believe, even in jurisdictions that permit only substantial compliance with the requirements under Matter of Lozada, that an attorney should be permitted to bypass this requirement by simply admitting error. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir. 2003) (providing that substantial compliance with the requirements under Matter of Lozada is permissible only “where their purpose is fully served by other means”).
 
For these reasons, I respectfully dissent. I would remand the record for the Immigration Judge to address the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in the first instance under Matter of Lozada.

The DHS continues to represent on appeal, as it did in its opposition to the motion to reopen, that it “has no record of the respondent’s presence being waived” (DHS’s Br. at 3). The digital audio recording of the December 2, 2016, hearing clearly reflects that the respondent’s presence was waived.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Margaret W. Wong, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondents, natives and citizens of Brazil, were ordered removed from the United States in absentia on October 6, 2016, after not appearing at a hearing. They filed a motion to reopen on November 13, 2017, and appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 18, 2017, denying the motion. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondents argue that “exceptional circumstances” prevented their appearance at the hearing. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C) (providing that a motion to reopen based on “exceptional circumstances,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1), must be filed within 180 days of the removal order). The respondents filed their motion to reopen more than a year after the Immigration Judge ordered their removal from the United States in absentia, and it is therefore untimely.
 
In addition, we decline, as requested on appeal, to equitably toll the 180-day period to file the motion (Respondent’s Br. at 7). See Alzaarir v. Att’y. Gen, of U.S., 639 F.3d 86, 90 (3d Cir. 2011) (stating that an Immigration Judge may equitably toll the period to file a motion if ineffective assistance of counsel prevented the filing, and the alien has exercised due diligence for the entire period requested to be tolled). In the affidavit, the lead respondent, hereafter respondent, states that an unknown individual, a Portuguese speaker, and possibly an alien smuggler, advised her to remove her ankle bracelet and not attend her hearing because it would result in her removal to Brazil. He further advised her that she did not have the money to afford an attorney and her best option was not to appear at her hearing. The respondent states that she followed the individual’s instructions because she did not understand the American immigration system and was afraid to return to Brazil.
 
However, the respondent’s decision to rely on the individual’s advice is not tantamount to ineffective assistance of counsel especially after an immigration officer personally served her with the Notice to Appear and advised her in her native language, Portuguese, of the consequences of not appearing at a hearing (Exh. 1). In addition, the respondent has not established that she exercised due diligence during the entire period that she requests the Board to toll. Hence, we decline to equitably toll the 180-day period to file the motion and find it to be filed untimely.
 
*2 In addition, the respondents have not established an exceptional situation to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s and the Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship). The respondent received the Notice to Appear, was advised by an immigration officer of the consequences of not attending a hearing, and made the calculated decision not to attend. Under these circumstances, we decline to reopen these proceedings sua sponte and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the motion.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Irving Joseph Gonzalez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Evagelia Stella Solomos
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On January 9, 2008, an Immigration Judge entered an in absentia order of removal. On December 6, 2017, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. On January 8, 2018, an Immigration Judge denied the motion. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.1
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent argued that he relied upon the advice of someone at his former attorney’s office that he should not appear at the January 2008 hearing (IJ at 2). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had received notice of the hearing, but was arguing that he had failed to appear due to ineffective assistance of counsel (IJ at 3 & n.3). The respondent does not challenge this characterization of events on appeal. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not complied with any of the three requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) to establish ineffective assistance of counsel (IJ at 3). On appeal, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge relied on the lack of a bar complaint in rejecting his ineffective assistance ot counsel claim (Respondent’s Br.).2
 
However, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not fulfill any of the three requirements, not only the third requirement relating to the filing of a bar complaint. The respondent does not address the other two requirements, i.e., that he provide an affidavit detailing the agreement entered into with counsel and that counsel be informed of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond. As the respondent does not identify any error in the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent did not comply with each part of Matter of Lozada, we conclude there is no reason to disturb that portion of the decision. The respondent’s motion is untimely and unexcused. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The respondent emphasizes his desire for sua sponte reopening. In 2013, the respondent married a United States citizen and he argues that he has an exceptional situation in that his wife has documented mental health problems (Respondent’s Br.). Moreover, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should have reopened and administratively closed the proceedings so that the respondent could adjust his status through a waiver before the agency (Respondent’s Br.).
 
Administrative closure is no longer appropriate in most circumstances. Matter of Castro-Tum, 27 I&N Dec. 271 (A.G. 2018). Moreover, the couple married after the respondent was in removal proceedings and had an order entered against him, and thus this outcome cannot be said to be an extraordinary circumstance. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (Board’s discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). For the above reasons, we decline to exercise our sua sponte authority. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 107 (1988) (“[M]otions to reopen are disfavored in deportation proceedings . . . [because] [t]here is a strong public interest in bringing litigation to a close as promptly” as possible.).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joanna Golding, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Luciana Dubuc
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on October 15, 2015, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision on July 28, 2014, which denied her motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered removed in absentia on November 29, 2011. On February 8, 2018, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen and reconsider our prior decision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a response in opposition to the respondent’s motion to reopen. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely. The Board entered the final administrative order in these proceedings on October 15, 2015. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), with certain exceptions not pertinent here, a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion to reopen until February 8, 2018 (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen and Reconsider (Motion)). The respondent has not shown that an exceptional situation exists that would warrant the Board’s exercise of discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
The respondent contends that she filed the instant motion to reopen because she identified substantial issues relating to proper notice and improper representation by prior counsel (Motion). The respondent asserts that she intends to pursue all possible relief and to supplement the motion with evidence of her eligibility for relief warranting reopening in this matter (Id.).
 
On October 15, 2015, the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge determination that the respondent received proper notice of her hearing held on November 29, 2011, and that she had neither alleged nor demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel (Board Dec. at 1-2). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639-40 (BIA 1988). The respondent’s instant motion raises the same issues that we considered and decided in our decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen proceedings following the entry of in absentia order of removal (Id.; Motion). See sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), (ii).
 
*2 The respondent did not demonstrate any error in our prior decision (Motion). She did not establish that her failure to appear at her scheduled immigration hearing was due to ineffective assistance of counsel or that she was prejudiced by her prior counsel’s performance (Id.). In her motion, the respondent states that she intends to submit new evidence to support her motion and general contention that she is eligible for relief (Id.). However, she has only submitted one new document, a Form I-797, Notice of Action, dated February 22, 2016, which indicates that she filed a Form I-918 petition for U nonimmigrant status. She has not submitted any other applications for relief. The respondent has not established that she is currently eligible for any relief from removal. The respondent has not established she did not receive proper notice of her hearing in 2011 or that her failure to appear at the hearing was beyond her control. See Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016) (an alien must establish that he pursued his or her rights with “reasonable diligence” and that his failure to appear was beyond his control); Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33, 36 (BIA 1998) (even where the exercise of due diligence is not a statutory requirement for reopening an in absentia deportation order, an alien’s lack of diligence may be a “factor that undercuts” the proffered explanation for the alien’s failure to appear at a scheduled immigration hearing).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

File: AXXX XX9 928 - Atlanta, GA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William Rounds, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision of October 20, 2017, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia on February 7, 2017. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
Contrary to the respondent’s appellate contention, notice on the respondent’s attorney constitutes notice to the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.26(c)(2), 1292.5(a); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien).
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that he never received notice of his hearing from his former counsel. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), are satisfied. Here, however, the respondent in his motion to reopen did not allege ineffective assistance by his former counsel. To the extent the respondent now on appeal alleges ineffective assistance by former counsel, he has not complied with any of the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639. Specifically, the respondent has not submitted an affidavit describing the facts and his agreement with his former counsel, nor has he provided any evidence that his former counsel has been made aware of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond, either after or before he filed his brief to the Board, nor did he indicate that a disciplinary complaint had been filed against his prior attorney. Consequently, the respondent has shown no error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen.
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge that no exceptional circumstances have been presented to warrant sua sponte reopening. The respondent has not explained why his previous counsel was unable to contact the respondent, he has conceded in his motion that he moved to California, and while he alleges he tried to call the Immigration Court, there is no evidence in the record that the respondent filed a written change of address with the Immigration Court.1 Pursuant to our holding in Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), the power to reopen sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Sanjay Sobti, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Andrea Siebert
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening, rescission
 
*1 This case was last before us on September 27, 2017, when we denied the respondents’ motion to reconsider the denial of their motion to reopen. On October 6, 2017, the respondents filed a motion to reopen and rescind claiming that they received ineffective assistance of counsel when filing their first motion to rescind the in absentia order entered against them.1 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the respondents’ motion. The respondents’ motion to reopen and rescind will be denied.
 
The respondents are a husband and wife and are natives and citizens of Romania. An Immigration Judge ordered them removed in absentia on October 5, 2011, when they failed to appear for their removal hearing. The respondents now seek rescission of that order on the ground that they did not receive notice of their hearing.2 In support of their motion, the respondents have submitted a signed declaration explaining the lack of notice, why they did not pursue rescission before 2015, and the ineffective assistance they received from their former attorney (Respondents’ Motion, Exhibit A). The respondents also have provided copies of documents they received in Canada, asylum applications, proof that they have appeared for their check-ins with the DHS, copies of the change of address forms they sent to the Immigration Court, and copies of the letter they sent to their former attorney and the bar compliant they filed against her (Respondent’s Motion, Exhibits B-F).
 
A motion to rescind an in absentia order based on a claim of lack of notice may be filed at any time. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii). The respondents’ motion therefore is not untimely.
 
The motion, however, is the respondents’ second motion to rescind and therefore could be numerically barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (stating that an alien may only file one motion to rescind an in absentia order). The respondents nevertheless claim they are entitled to equitable tolling of the numeric limit in light of the errors of their former attorney and their diligence in pursuing relief. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-98 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating that the court recognizes equitable tolling of deadlines and numerical limits on motions to reopen or reconsider during periods when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). Even if we accept the respondents’ arguments regarding equitable tolling of the numeric limit, the respondents have not met their burden of establishing that rescission of the in absentia order is warranted due to lack of notice. We therefore will deny their motion.
 
*2 To obtain rescission of their in absentia order, the respondents must submit sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that they received proper notice of their hearing. See Matter of C-R-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 677 (BIA 2008); Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674-76 (BIA 2008); Sembiring v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 981 (9th Cir. 2007) (discussing considerations in determining whether alien has overcome the weaker presumption of delivery when notice sent by regular mail). The record establishes, and the respondents do not dispute, that the respondents were served with the Notice to Appear in person (Exh. 1). The respondents also do not dispute that they received the notice for their original hearing scheduled in Harlingen, Texas, on August 2, 2011. The respondents, however, have submitted a signed statement explaining that they did not receive notification that their request for a change of venue to Los Angeles was granted or notice of their hearing in Los Angeles on October 5, 2011 (Respondent’s Motion, Exhibit A). The respondents state that they notified the Harlingen Immigration Court several times of their change in address, but they did not receive anything from the court. They indicate that they became concerned but could not afford to hire an attorney. The respondents claim that friends advised them to go to Canada to pursue asylum and that they took this advice and left the United States in late August or early September 2011 (Respondent’s Motion, Exhibit A). The respondents assert that they did not receive the notice regarding their hearing in Los Angeles before they left.
 
The documents in the record support the respondents’ statements. The record contains two change of address forms that the respondents filed with the Harlingen Immigration Court on January 10, 2011, and July 18, 2011 (Exhibits 2 and 4). The record also contains a handwritten note, filed on June 30, 2011, that appears to request a change of venue to Los Angeles, California. These filings indicate that the respondents were attempting to pursue their case in Immigration Court and support the respondents’ assertion that they were concerned because they did not receive any correspondence from the Immigration Court.
 
Nevertheless, the respondents have not adequately explained why, if they had not heard anything from the Immigration Court in Harlingen, they did not appear at their August 2, 2011, hearing in Harlingen or contact the court. Further, the respondents’ statements indicate that they could have been on their way to Canada when the notice of their October 5, 2011, hearing arrived by mail. The respondents’ failure to receive notice of their October 5, 2011, hearing therefore could have been their own fault. Cf. Vukmirovic v. Holder, 640 F.3d 977 (9th Cir. 2011) (finding no exceptional circumstances to excuse failure to appear at hearing when alien had not kept the government informed of his address); Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674 (BIA 2008) (a respondent cannot evade delivery of a properly sent notice of hearing by relocating without providing the required change of address and then request reopening of the in absentia proceeding on the basis of a claim of lack of notice). Given these facts, we cannot conclude that the respondents have met their burden of establishing that rescission of the in absentia order entered against them is warranted, and we will deny their motion to rescind.3
 
*3 In addition, the respondents have not established that sua sponte reopening of their proceedings is appropriate. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen and their motion to rescind the in absentia order entered against them are denied.

The respondents also filed a response to the DHS’ opposition to their motion. We have considered the arguments raised both in their motion and their response in rendering this decision.

2

As part of their lack of notice claim, the respondents assert that they were not given oral notice of the consequences of failing to appear at their hearing in a language they understood. The statute, however, only requires that individuals receive written notice of the proceedings against them. See section 239(a)(1) and (2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1) and (2). Whether an alien received proper oral notice of the consequences of failing to appear at a hearing is only relevant to a determination regarding the bars to certain forms of discretionary relief for failure to appear. See section 240(b)(7) of the Act. Accordingly, the respondents’ claimed lack of oral notice is not relevant to their motion to rescind the in absentia order. Further, their claim does not affect the validity of the Notices to Appear issued in their case. Finally, the Form I-213 prepared in their case contradicts their oral notice claim. The document states that all forms were explained to the respondents in Romanian (Exh. 7).

3

The evidence of record shows that the hearing notice and the Immigration Judge’s decision granting a change of venue were mailed to the respondents’ address of record. The respondents’ only evidence of non-receipt is a joint statement (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Exhibit A). Given the other circumstances of the respondents’ case, including their departure from the United States, this statement is not sufficient to establish that the respondents did not bear some responsibility for the lack of notice. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 674.

File: AXXX XX9 566 - San Diego, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas D. Nelson, Esquire
 
AMENDED DECISION
 
*1 ORDER:
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 21, 2017, which found that he had abandoned his opportunity to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1), but granted his request for voluntary departure. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion denied.
 
The record shows that during the September 8, 2016, hearing the Immigration Judge explained to the respondent and counsel that he set a deadline of December 7, 2016, for the filing of the application (IJ at 1-2; Tr. at 31). During the next hearing, the Immigration Judge extended the deadline and advised the respondent and counsel that his application must be filed no later than March 17, 2017 (IJ at 1-2; Tr. at 39-40). In his June 21 2017, decision, the Immigration Judge observed that no application had been filed and deemed it abandoned (IJ at 1-4). For the reasons provided in the written decision, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination to deem the application abandoned (IJ at 1-4). 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1003.31(c). On appeal, the respondent, through counsel, concedes that the application was not filed with the Court, but explains that “counsel has committed a mistake,” and counsel seeks to take full responsibility for the failure to file (Respondent’s Brief at 5). To the extent the respondent is alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, we find no “substantial compliance” with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Castillo-Perez v. I.N.S., 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000), Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.1
 
Turning to the respondent’s motion to reopen, we construe it as a motion to remand because it was filed during the pendency of this appeal. Although the respondent has finally submitted a copy of the application with his motion, the motion is denied. This Board is an appellate body charged with reviewing determinations made by Immigration Judges. We discern no error by the Immigration Judge in deeming the application abandoned. Further, the respondent has not met his heavy burden or demonstrated prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1992) (explaining that a party who seeks a remand or to reopen proceedings to pursue relief bears a “heavy burden” of proving that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case).
 
*2 FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248 and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sanjay Sethi, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge, dated January 29, 2018, denying his motion to reopen. We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on June 8, 2005. His motion to reopen, filed on January 2, 2008, was untimely. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). While, on appeal, the respondent refers to ineffective assistance of counsel, he does not meaningfully argue that, between the entry of the order of removal and the filing of his motion, he exercised the requisite due diligence needed to equitably toll the applicable 90-day filing deadline. Avila-Santoyo v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 713 F.3d 1357, 1363 n.5 (11th Cir. 2013). To the extent that the respondent is seeking reopening in order to apply for asylum and related forms of relief, an alien who has been ordered removed cannot file a successive asylum application except as part of a timely and properly filed motion to reopen or one that claims that the late motion is excused because of changed country conditions. Chen v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 565 F.3d 805, 810 (11th Cir. 2009).
 
The respondent has not established changed country conditions in Jamaica should excuse the untimeliness of his motion. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). In determining whether evidence accompanying a motion to reopen demonstrates a material change in country conditions that would justify reopening, we compare the evidence of country conditions submitted with the motion to those that existed at the time of the merits hearing below. Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247, 253 (BIA 2007). However, the respondent did not present any remarkable evidence of country conditions in Jamaica with his motion to reopen. On appeal, the respondent, who claims that he is a homosexual, has presented numerous documents concerning the treatment of homosexuals in that country. The Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices which was previously presented to the Immigration Judge indicates that, at the time of his ultimate removal hearing, brutality against homosexuals in Jamaica was reportedly “widespread” (Exh. 5). While the evidence presented on appeal confirms that homosexuals are still targeted for violence in Jamaica, the evidence does not establish a change, as opposed to a continuation, of conditions since the time of his removal hearing on June 8, 2005.
 
*2 Finally, to the extent that the respondent’s arguments on appeal can be construed as a request for sua sponte reopening, such measure is not warranted. The respondent’s arguments on appeal, cumulatively considered, do not persuade this Board that an exceptional situation exists which would justify sua sponte reopening. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, as we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maria Janossy, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s December 28, 2017, decision that denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent reiterates that he demonstrated exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “““exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), are satisfied. Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 596 (9th Cir. 2004) (considering an alien’s claim that ineffective assistance of counsel qualifies as an exceptional circumstance warranting rescission of an in absentia order); Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, 337 F.3d 892 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that alien established that his failure to appear was due to his reasonable and justifiable reliance on the advice of his attorney’s agent, such that alien was entitled to rescission of in absentia removal order on basis of exceptional circumstances). Upon our de novo review, we conclude that based upon the totality of the circumstances in this case the respondent has met the burden of demonstrating exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear and thereby his November 16, 2017, in absentia order of removal is rescinded. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i).
 
Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lisette Cardo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Todd Keller
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s December 6, 2017, decision denying her motion to reopen the removal proceedings and to rescind an in absentia removal order issued on March 24, 2006. In conjunction with the appeal the respondent has filed documentary evidence relating to her asylum claim under section 208(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1)(B), which we construe as a motion to remand. The Department of Homeland Security has filed a motion for summary affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion to remand will be denied.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including credibility findings, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On November 10, 2005, the respondent was personally served with a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) ordering her to report for a hearing at the Immigration Court in San Antonio, Texas, at a date and time to be set, and she was advised in her native language, Spanish, of her obligation to inform the Immigration Court of her address (IJ at 1; Exh. 1 at 2). The respondent did not report an address. A hearing was scheduled at the San Antonio Immigration Court for March 24, 2006. The respondent did not appear for the hearing on March 24, 2006, and was ordered removed in absentia on that date. On July 22, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and change venue, which was denied. On November 16, 2017, the respondent filed a “Motion to Rescind [the] In Absentia Removal Order and to Reopen Removal Proceedings Pursuant to Sua Sponte Authority.” The respondent sought reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel, changed country conditions, and based on the Immigration Judge’s sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings.
 
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing or was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 723 (BIA 1999). Exceptional circumstances include serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of an immediate relative of the alien, but not less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act. Under certain circumstances, the filing deadline for a motion to reopen may be subject to equitable tolling. See, e.g., Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337 (5th Cir. 2016).
 
*2 As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent did not comply with the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). While we acknowledge that those requirements are not in every case mandatory, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish that the attorney whom she asserts rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in fact represented her at the relevant time (IJ at 4). Furthermore, she has not otherwise complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, in particular the requirement that prior counsel be informed of the asserted ineffective assistance. As such, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s arguments on appeal that the Immigration Judge should have granted equitable tolling of the time and motion deadlines on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. In any event, such ineffective assistance of counsel would only relate to the first motion, not to the respondent’s failure to appear at her scheduled hearing. We conclude, for the reasons given by the Immigration Judge, that equitable tolling on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is not warranted in this case (IJ at 4-5).
 
We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish changed country conditions as a basis for reopening. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had not submitted information regarding relevant conditions in El Salvador in 2006, and therefore did not provide a meaningful basis for comparison with conditions in 2017, when her most recent motion was filed (IJ at 6). Furthermore, she did not corroborate a significant aspect of the claimed change, namely that gang members were now targeting members of the church to which she belongs, the Episcopal Church (IJ at 6). In view of the foregoing, the respondent has not met her burden to establish a basis for reopening based on changed country conditions pursuant to section 240(C)(7)(c)(ii) of the Act; see generally Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247 (BIA 2007).
 
Further, we are not persuaded by the respondent’s claim that the Immigration Judge erred in declining to reopen proceedings sua sponte. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not provided evidence of circumstances that would justify the extraordinary remedy of reopening her removal proceedings sua sponte. See, e.g., Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (holding that discretion to reopen a case sua sponte is “an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating that sua sponte reopening is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
*3 The respondent has submitted evidence on appeal. Upon review of the evidence, we decline to remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge to consider this evidence, as the evidence has not been shown to affect the outcome of this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
The following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Benjamin T. Wiesinger, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 16, 2017, denying her second motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia on May 5, 2010. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
As an initial matter, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and numerically barred, inasmuch as it was not submitted within 90 days of the Immigration Judge’s May 5, 2010, decision and is the respondent’s second motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b).
 
We are unpersuaded by the respondent’s argument that the numerical bar should be equitably tolled on the basis that she was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel who filed her prior motion to reopen. Although the respondent complied with the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), she did not establish that her former attorney’s actions were actually prejudicial to her case. See id. at 640; see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent was present in Court when the Immigration Judge issued the May 3, 2010, filing deadline for any application for relief and informed the parties of the consequences of failing to meet the deadline. The respondent did not seek or identify voluntary departure as a form of relief, and when she failed to submit an application for cancellation of removal, the Immigration Judge properly deemed her application abandoned and issued a removal order on May 5, 2010. The respondent did not file her first motion to reopen until nearly seven years later. In the interim, she did not maintain contact with her attorney, assumed that her removal proceedings may have been administratively closed, and failed to inquire with the Court regarding the status of her case. Such actions were not reasonable and do not warrant tolling of the filing deadline for the seven year period until her first motion to reopen was filed in May 2017. Regardless of any deficiencies in the respondent’s first motions, they were untimely filed. The respondent has not demonstrated that any of her motions to reopen should have been equitably tolled, as she has not established that the outcome of her proceedings may have been affected by the ineffective assistance she allegedly received. Thus, the respondent did not establish actual prejudice due to the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 793-94 (9th Cir. 2005). In light of the foregoing, we conclude that a remand for further consideration of this issue is not warranted.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: MARIO SALVADOR SORIANO-MENDOSA
File: AXXX XX9 818 - Salt Lake City, UT

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jesus E. Saucedo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Saida Ulle
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals the Immigration Judge’s July 11, 2017, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal. A motion to reconsider filed by the respondent with the Immigration Judge prior to the respondent’s filing of this appeal has been forwarded with the record for our consideration.1 The Department of Homeland Security’s (“DHS”) motion to accept its late-filed brief is granted. The respondent filed a request for a stay of removal with the Board. The appeal will be dismissed, the respondent’s motion will be denied, and the request for a stay of removal will be denied.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
An order of removal entered in absentia may only be rescinded under the following conditions: 1) if filed within 180 days after the date of entry of the final order of removal, if failure to appear was based on exceptional circumstances; or 2) if filed at any time if the alien did not receive notice. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i), (ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), (ii). On appeal, the respondent argues that exceptional circumstances, namely, ineffective assistance of counsel, justify reopening his removal proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 2, December 29, 2017). Alternatively, the respondent requests that proceedings be reopened sua sponte to allow the respondent to seek adjustment of status through his U.S. citizen wife (Respondent’s Br. at 2, December 29, 2017).
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen for the reasons stated therein (IJ at 4-6). Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872 (BIA 1994). While the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent has not demonstrated that equitable tolling applies, as he has not shown due diligence in pursuing his claim (IJ at 4). Moreover, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances, as he has not met the substantive requirements of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim (IJ at 4-5). Finally, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent has not shown prejudice, as he did not demonstrate that counsel’s actions foreclosed any available relief (IJ at 5). We address the following in light of the arguments raised by the respondent on appeal.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in holding that he did not exercise due diligence in seeking to reopen his case (Respondent’s Br. at 16-20, December 29, 2017; Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider at 13-15). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish that he exercised due diligence in seeking reopening, where the respondent sought reopening over 5 1/2 years after being ordered removed in absentia. See Mahamat v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1281, 1283 (10th Cir. 2005) (an alien must also show that he exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll); Riley v. INS, 310 F.3d 1253, 1258 (10th Cir. 2002) (ineffective assistance of counsel may toll the filing period for a motion to reopen). The respondent was ordered removed on September 29, 2011, and his motion to reopen was filed on May 24, 2017 (IJ at 4). The respondent admits that he was aware that he missed his hearing date almost immediately, as his attorney called him on the day of the hearing from court to ask him when he would arrive (IJ at 4; Respondent’s Motion, tab B at 6). The respondent states that he met with attorneys in July 2012, February 2013, April 2013, summer 2013, April 2014, and at some point after that, the respondent obtained current counsel (IJ at 4; Respondent’s Motion, tab B at 6-7). In his motion, the respondent states that he met with current counsel in 2014, filed a Freedom of Information Act request, and it was not determined that the respondent had a potential ineffective assistance of counsel claim until March 2017, 2 months prior to filing a motion to reopen (IJ at 4; Respondent’s Motion at 6).
 
However, in his affidavit, the respondent states that as early as May 2011, his attorney’s “lack of competence” was becoming an issue (Respondent’s Motion, tab B at 5). Despite this, the respondent states that he was not aware that his prior attorney had done anything wrong until meeting with current counsel (Respondent’s Motion, tab B at 7). As noted by the Immigration Judge, merely consulting with attorneys, many of whom told the respondent that they would assist him in stopping the execution of his removal order, without further pursuing legal assistance to reopen his case, is not sufficient to demonstrate that he had been diligent during the entire period he seeks to toll (IJ at 4; Respondent’s Motion, tab B at 6-7). Moreover, even assuming the respondent was not aware of the possibility of ineffective assistance of counsel until meeting with current counsel, without further explanation, the respondent has not established due diligence when it took nearly 3 years to file a motion to reopen after apparently retaining counsel (IJ at 4; Respondent’s Motion, tab B at 7). Thus, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated that he acted with due diligence in pursuing his alleged ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
 
*3 On appeal, the respondent further argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he did not meet his burden to establish exceptional circumstances, as he has not shown that counsel’s assistance was ineffective (Respondent’s Br. at 6-8, February 9, 2018; Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider at 11-12). Despite the respondent’s assertions, even assuming that the respondent has met the due diligence requirement, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not shown that ineffective assistance of counsel caused him to miss his hearing (IJ at 4-5). As noted by the Immigration Judge, the record reflects that the respondent was in court when notice of the September 29, 2011, hearing was provided to him and to his attorney in person (IJ at 4). See 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a) (providing that whenever an alien is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to attorney of record); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the alien). In light of this, the respondent was provided proper notice in accordance with section 239(a)(2) of the Act. See section 239(a)(2) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.13, 1003.18. However, the respondent argues that even if notice was proper for his September 29, 2011, hearing before the Immigration Judge, prior counsel did not exercise sufficient professional competence to ensure the respondent’s appearance for his hearing, which caused him to miss his hearing (Respondent’s Br. at 6, February 9, 2018).
 
We are not persuaded by the respondent’s arguments on appeal. Despite receiving proper notice of his September 29, 2011, hearing on May 26, 2011, the respondent stated that he contacted former counsel on September 5, 2011, asking him to keep him informed as to any upcoming hearing dates (IJ at 4-5; Respondent’s Motion, tab B at 5). The respondent further states that he never heard back from counsel as to when his next hearing was (IJ at 4-5; Respondent’s Motion, tab B at 5-6). As such, the respondent’s argument is essentially that he failed to receive proper notice from his attorney as to his hearing date and therefore, he failed to appear. However, as noted above, the respondent was in court when notice of the September 29, 2011, hearing was provided to him in person (IJ at 4). As such, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent was provided proper notice in accordance with section 239(a)(2) of the Act, and that any failure of counsel to remind him of the scheduled hearing does not rise to the level of ineffective assistance (IJ at 4). Therefore, even assuming that the respondent has demonstrated due diligence, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not meet his burden to establish exceptional circumstances that justify his failure to appear.
 
*4 On appeal, the respondent further argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that the respondent has not demonstrated he was prejudiced by prior counsel’s actions (IJ at 5; Respondent’s Br. at 14-16, December 29, 2017; Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider at 10-12, 16-18). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not shown that his prior counsel’s allegedly deficient performance caused him prejudice, as the record does not demonstrate that prior counsel failed to file an application for relief on the respondent’s behalf at the time of the respondent’s removal hearing. See Ochieng v. Mukasey, 520 F.3d 1110, 1115 (10th Cir. 2008) (alien must show that counsel’s ineffective assistance prejudiced him); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003) (“an alien alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must also show that he or she was prejudiced by the actions or inactions of counsel”). Although the respondent argues that his former attorney failed to file an asylum application on his behalf, as noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent does not describe in his affidavit that he had any conversations with counsel regarding the filing of an asylum application, nor has he provided any evidence to establish his eligibility for asylum and related relief (IJ at 5; Respondent’s Br. at 15). In fact, when the Immigration Judge asked if the respondent would be filing an asylum application, counsel stated that he had filed an I-360 and I-485 for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”), as he believed this to be a better avenue for relief (IJ at 5).
 
In addition, the respondent argues that former counsel failed to respond to a Request for Evidence (“RFE”) from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), which resulted in the denial of his I-360 (IJ at 5; Respondent’s Br. at 14-15; Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider at 12). As noted by the Immigration Judge, the record indicates that while his first I-360 was denied for failure to respond to an RFE, USCIS later reopened the application and allowed the respondent another opportunity to reply to the RFE (IJ at 5). Although the respondent claims that his attorney never responded to the second RFE and that the application was therefore denied, the respondent did not address this in his affidavit and did not submit evidence to corroborate this claim (IJ at 5; Respondent’s Br. at 15). In fact, the evidence submitted by the respondent for the first time on appeal pertaining to this claim demonstrates that the I-360 had been pending since it was reopened in April 2011 and was recently denied by USCIS on August 24, 2017, as the respondent is now over 21 years old and married and therefore ineligible under section 101(a)(27)(J) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J) (Respondent’s Br., tab E at 39). Thus, for the foregoing reasons, the respondent has not demonstrated the requisite prejudice to support his claim, as he has not demonstrated that any alleged deficiencies of his former counsel affected the outcome of proceedings (IJ at 5). See Ochieng v. Mukasey, 520 F.3d at 1115.
 
*5 The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances sufficient to justify exercising his discretionary authority to reopen the respondent’s removal proceedings sua sponte, and we decline to disturb his determination (IJ at 6; Respondent’s Br. at 8-11, February 9, 2018; Respondent’s Br. at 23-25, December 29, 2017; Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider at 18-21). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”).
 
To the extent that the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge did not consider the entire record in rendering his decision, we observe that an Immigration Judge is not required to discuss every piece of evidence of record in a decision (Respondent’s Br. at 21-22, December 29, 2017). Moreover, we have held that an Immigration Judge may make reasonable inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence in the record and is not required to interpret the evidence in the manner advocated by the respondent. See Matter of D-R-, 25 I&N Dec. 445, 454-55 (BIA 2011), clarified on other grounds by Matter of D-R-, 27 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 2017).
 
In his brief, the respondent has requested that we reissue the Immigration Judge’s September 29, 2011, decision in the interests of justice and to cure the errors made by prior counsel (Respondent’s Br. at 23, December 29, 2017). To the extent that the respondent’s request constitutes a request to reopen his removal proceedings and rescind his in absentia order, the request will be denied for the reasons discussed above.
 
The respondent submitted additional documents with his appellate brief and in a supplemental motion (Respondent’s Br., tabs A-H, February 9, 2018; Respondent’s Br., tabs A-U, December 29, 2017; Supplement in Support of Motion to Reopen, April 27, 2018). The Board does not consider new evidence presented for the first time on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (limiting the Board’s fact finding authority); see also Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 73-74 and n.10 (BIA 1984). Furthermore, even assuming the evidence was new and previously unavailable, to the extent that the request to consider these documents constitutes a motion to remand, the evidence submitted does not warrant a remand for further proceedings because it would not alter the outcome of this case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
*6 Finally, we note that the respondent requested reopening to pursue adjustment of status in conjunction with an I-601A provisional unlawful presence waiver (Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 2). Effective August 29, 2016, there are new rules regarding provisional unlawful presence waivers. See Expansion of Provisional Unlawful Presence Waivers of Inadmissibility, 81 Fed. Reg. 50,244, 50,255-56, 50, 262 (July 29, 2016). The DHS has amended the rule to allow individuals with final removal orders to apply for provisional unlawful presence waivers if they have filed an application seeking consent to reapply for admission and such an application has been conditionally approved by the USCIS. See 81 Fed. Reg. 50,244, 50,275-76 (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 212.7(e)(4)(iv)). Thus, the respondent does not need to have his removal proceedings reopened to be able to apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver with the USCIS. The respondent may request an administrative stay of removal from the DHS while any waiver or provisional waiver applications are pending before the USCIS. 8 C.F.R. § 241.6(a).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

The respondent filed a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Court on August 10, 2017 (Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider). However, the respondent perfected a timely appeal by filing a Notice of Appeal with this Board on August 10, 2017, prior to the Immigration Judge issuing a decision on the pending motion (Respondent’s Notice of Appeal). Accordingly, jurisdiction vested with the Board and the Immigration Judge was divested of jurisdiction over the motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of H-, 20 I&N Dec. 611, 612 n.1 (BIA 1992). That motion is now before us as a motion to remand, and the arguments therein are incorporated into the appeal and addressed in this decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4); BIA Practice Manual Rule 4.2(a)(ii).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrew Joseph Oliver, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jodilyn A. Erikson-Muldrew
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 19, 2017, denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The record will be remanded.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including the determination of credibility, for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including questions of judgment, discretion, and law, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent, who was previously represented by attorney Kaaren Barr, was granted pre-conclusion voluntary departure for a period of 120 days on April 24, 2008 (IJ at 1). See section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a). On April 29, 2008, the respondent, still represented by Ms. Barr, filed a motion to reopen proceedings to pursue an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), noting that Ms. Barr had mistakenly thought that the respondent did not have the requisite years of continuous physical presence to qualify for relief (IJ at 2). On April 30, 2008, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, finding that the respondent’s motion was “not supported by changed circumstances” because his qualifying relatives, presence in the United States, and lack of disqualifying crimes were known at the time the respondent accepted pre-conclusion voluntary departure (IJ at 2). Ms. Barr filed a motion to reconsider on May 28, 2008, which was denied that same day. Ms. Barr then filed an untimely appeal of the denial of the motion to this Board, which dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction on July 15, 2008 (IJ at 2). Ms. Barr was later disbarred, effective March 9, 2012.
 
The respondent departed the United States on or about August 21, 2008, and reentered without being admitted or paroled 5 years later (IJ at 2; Respondent’s Br. at 5). On October 5, 2017, he filed a motion to reopen to apply for cancellation of removal, arguing that his prior attorney provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel, including by failing to recognize that he was eligible for this form of relief prior to accepting pre-conclusion voluntary departure, by failing to set forth clearly a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the prior motion to reopen, and by appealing the denial of the prior motion in an untimely fashion. The respondent argued that the time and number limitations that ordinarily apply to motions to reopen should be equitably tolled; alternatively, he argued that proceedings should be reopened sua sponte (Respondent’s Mot. at 9). The DHS opposed the motion to reopen, arguing that the Immigration Judge did not have jurisdiction in reinstatement proceedings to reopen “the 2007 expedited order of removal” against the respondent (DHS’s Opposition to Motion to Reopen Removal Proceedings at 3).1
 
*2 On October 19, 2017, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, noting that the respondent’s motion was his second motion to reopen proceedings and that it was untimely (IJ at 2). The Immigration Judge also found that because the respondent departed the United States in 2008, he did not have the required 10 years of continuous physical presence for cancellation of removal (IJ at 2). See section 240A(b)(1)(A) of the Act. The respondent timely appealed.
 
Regarding the respondent’s eligibility for cancellation of removal, we note that the period of continuous physical presence was deemed to end upon the service of the Notice to Appear, in this case March 26, 2008 (Exh. 1). See section 240A(d)(1) of the Act. Assuming that the respondent can demonstrate that he was continuously physically present for 10 years prior to this date, he is not precluded from relief. Further, while the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had filed a prior motion to reopen and that the 2017 motion was untimely, the Ninth Circuit has held that the time and numerical limitations on motions to reopen are amenable to equitable tolling due to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Salazar-Gonzalez v. Lynch, 798 F.3d 917, 920 (9th Cir. 2015); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176, 1188 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc). Equitable tolling is available “when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error.” Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
Here, the Immigration Judge made no findings regarding whether ineffective assistance of counsel warranted equitable tolling and whether the respondent acted with the requisite diligence in discovering the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Additionally, the Immigration Judge did not consider whether exceptional circumstances exist to warrant reopening sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, we will remand for additional fact finding and analysis in this regard. On remand, the parties may introduce any evidence relevant to these proceedings.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

The DHS reiterates this argument on appeal (DHS’s Br. at 3). However, the record does not contain evidence indicating that the respondent has an expedited order of removal from 2007 or that the DHS has actually taken steps to reinstate a prior removal order. Additionally, the respondent is not attempting to reopen a 2007 expedited order of removal, but instead the removal proceedings that resulted in an order of voluntary departure on April 24, 2008.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Adam L. Crayk, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening; stay of removal
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on November 30, 2017, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s April 14, 2017,1 decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed from the United States in absentia. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider and reopen based on the ineffective assistance of his former counsel, and a request for a stay of removal. Essentially, the respondent alleges that he was never notified of the hearing date because his former counsel’s office erroneously sent an electronic copy of the notice to an incorrect e-mail address (Motion to Reconsider and Remand at 1, 4-5, Exh. 1). The record before us does not contain a brief from the Department of Homeland Security opposing the instant motion.2 The motion will be granted and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The respondent’s motion and supporting evidence convince us that reconsideration and reopening are warranted in this case. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a)-(b)(1), (c)(1). In our prior decision, we concluded that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen because he had not filed a bar complaint against his former counsel pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988);3 and declined to consider evidence submitted on appeal. Given the circumstances and evidence presented in this case, including more recent evidence that the Utah State Bar has received and is investigating the respondent’s bar complaint against his former counsel (Motion to Reconsider and Remand, Exhs. 1-2), we will grant the motion, vacate our prior decision, and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision. On remand, the parties may submit additional arguments and evidence pertinent to this case. We express no opinion on the outcome of this case. Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider and reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s November 30, 2017, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s April 14, 2017, and March 23, 2017, decisions are vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDEER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision, and for the issuance of a new decision.
 
*2 FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

Although the Immigration Judge’s written decision is dated April 12, 2017, it was not actually mailed to the respondent until April 14, 2017.

Although DHS has not filed a brief in opposition to the instant motion, it did oppose the motion to reopen filed with the Immigration Judge in the proceedings below.

Under Matter of Lozada a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires the following evidence: (1) an affidavit describing in detail the agreement with former counsel, (2) proof that former counsel was informed of the allegations and had an opportunity to respond, and (3) a statement regarding whether a complaint was filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and, if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639. See also Infanzon v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 1359, 1363 (10th Cir. 2004) (emphasizing the necessity of complying with the Lozada requirements).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vina Maria Fleisig, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on February 21, 2018, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s September 7, 2017, decision to deny his motion to reopen an order of removal entered in absentia. The respondent has now submitted an untimely motion to reopen proceedings on March 23, 2018. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion, which will be granted.
 
With his motion to reopen, the respondent alleges that his former attorney’s law firm, whom he hired in 2005 and who represented him during the time his 2009 Notice to Appear and subsequent in absentia removal order were issued, failed to inform him that they had not filed his Form I-751 in a timely fashion in 2008.1 In prior pleadings before the Immigration Judge and the Board, the respondent was represented by this prior law firm, and his requests for reopening were based on, inter alia, the failure to identify the name of the attorney who was supposed to file the Form I-751 (August 24, 2017 IJ at 1; September 7, 2017 IJ at 1), and the failure to file a proper claim pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).2
 
The respondent, with the assistance of current counsel, has now filed an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his prior law firm, and has included, inter alia, an affidavit and a copy of a complaint filed with the First Judicial Department, Attorney Grievance Committee, New York, New York, which outlines the respondent’s complaints. Given the evidence of record, the respondent’s proffered motion evidence, the arguments set forth in his current and prior motions, and the lack of DHS opposition, we will reopen the proceedings sua sponte to allow the respondent to present his arguments and evidence regarding his removability and, if necessary, his applications for relief from removal. The following order will, thus, be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

The respondent does not allege that his prior law firm represented him in removal proceedings, because he has alleged, consistently, that he never received his Notice to Appear. The DHS charged him with removability under section 237(a)(2)(D)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(D)(i), for failing to remove the conditions on his permanent residence pursuant to a Form I-751.

The respondent’s prior attorney argued that the respondent warranted a reopening of his proceedings based on “extraordinary circumstances.”

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sumaira Khan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia, has appealed the September 15, 2017, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia for her failure to appear for the hearing on April 21, 2003. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that she did not receive actual notice of the hearing. She claims that the notice of hearing was improperly sent to her friend, Mr. Hoyos, who paid the respondent’s bond. The respondent states that she is now eligible for apply for adjustment of status.
 
An alien may not be entitled to receive notice of his hearing if he does not provide an address at which he may be contacted during proceedings. See section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(B) (eliminating the notice requirement where the alien fails to provide the required contact information); see also Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 674-75 (BIA 2008) (stating that an alien must comply with the statutory responsibility to provide current address information).
 
Upon de novo review, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the motion to reopen. The record reflects that the Notice to Appear (NTA) was served personally on the respondent on July 6, 2001, and it contains the respondent’s signature (Exh. 1). The NTA advised the respondent of her obligation to maintain a current mailing address with the Immigration Court and of the consequences of failing to appear for any scheduled hearings. The NTA reflects that the respondent received oral notice in the Spanish language of the consequences of failing to appear for a hearing. The NTA informed the respondent that she had been placed in removal proceedings, and it provided information regarding the nature of the proceedings, including the opportunity to seek representation, and the conduct of the hearing. Current law does not require that the NTA be in any language other than English. See section 239 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229.
 
We note that on September 28, 2001, the respondent’s former attorney, Gino M. Mesa, filed a Form G-28 and a motion to change venue with the Houston Immigration Court, both of which set forth the respondent’s address on Cook Avenue, in Madison, New Jersey. On October 10, 2001, the change of venue to the Newark Immigration Court was granted. Mr. Mesa filed a motion to withdraw as attorney of record with the Newark Immigration Court on November 20, 2001, and again listed the respondent’s address on Cook Avenue, in Madison, New Jersey. The Newark Immigration Court initially sent notices of hearing to Mr. Mesa. However, on September 23, 2002, December 24, 2002, December 31, 2002, and February 4, 2003, the Newark Immigration Court sent notices of hearing to the respondent at the Cook Avenue address in Madison, New Jersey. The envelope containing the February 4, 2003, hearing notice was returned to the Immigration Court as “not deliverable as addressed - unable to forward,” and is in the record of proceedings. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on April 21, 2003, due to her failure to appear for the hearing.
 
*2 The respondent contends that the notice of hearing should have been sent to her at the address that appears on the Form I-213, dated June 29, 2001. However, the notice of hearing was sent to the respondent at the most recent address provided by the respondent’s former attorney. The respondent has not provided any evidence about where she actually lived, and she never provided a change of address to the Immigration Court in the 16 years since she was served with the NTA, as she was instructed to do. While the respondent contends that the Cook Avenue address belonged to a friend who posted bond, the respondent did not update her address with the Immigration Court, nor has she alleged ineffective assistance of counsel for her failure to appear. See Ramos-Olivieri v. Att’y Gen., 624 F.3d 622 (3d Cir. 2010) (court held that Board acted within its discretion denying motion to reopen since an evidentiary hearing on receipt of notice not warranted when alien both fails to arrange for a responsible person who still resides at the alien’s former address to forward all mail he receives and the alien fails to notify immigration authorities of a change in address); see also Santana Gonzalez v. Att’y Gen., 506 F.3d 274 (3d Cir. 2007); (holding that a weaker presumption of receipt applies when a notice of hearing is sent by regular mail); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Consequently, the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Disha Chandiramani, Esquire
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated December 18, 2017, finding him ineligible from relief from removal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent was charged with being subject to removal under sections 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), (A)(iii), and (B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), A(iii), and (B)(i), as an alien who was convicted of a violation of a crime involving moral turpitude, a violation controlled substance and an aggravated felony, respectively. The Immigration Judge sustained the charge of removability and found the respondent ineligible for any relief from removal (IJ at 2). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision which has not been meaningfully challenged on appeal. The respondent is barred from cancellation of removal, as this form of relief is not available to lawful permanent resident aliens who, like the respondent, have been convicted of aggravated felonies. See section 240A(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229b(a)(3). The respondent to be statutorily ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal due to his aggravated felony conviction for a particularly serious crime for which he received a sentence of at least 5 years (IJ at 2). See sections 208(b)(2)(B)(i), 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.13(c), 1208.16(d)(2). The respondent did not apply for deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 2; Tr. at 13). With regard to the relief of adjustment of status, under section 245 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255, the respondent has not shown that he is currently eligible for adjustment of status. There is no evidence that the respondent has an approved visa petition, or that a visa petition has ever been filed on his behalf.
 
The respondent claims on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred in denying him a continuance to collaterally attack his conviction pursuant to Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010) (Tr. at 6-7, 13-16).1 Though the respondent has filed a post-conviction motion to vacate the conviction, it does not render the conviction non-final. We note that the respondent’s conviction became final for immigration purposes when the respondent failed to appeal his conviction, allowed the appeal period to lapse, waived his right to a direct appeal, or exhausted the direct appeal of his conviction. See section 101(a)(48)(A) of Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A); Matter of Abreu, 24 I&N Dec. 795, 802 n. 8 (BIA 2009). We point out that this Board and the federal courts have consistently held that an alien may not collaterally attack the legitimacy of an otherwise valid state or federal criminal conviction in immigration proceedings. See Matter of Ponce De Leon Ruiz, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (BIA 1996, 1997; A.G. 1997); Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750 (BIA 1993); Matter of Fortis, 14 I&N Dec. 576, 577 (BIA 1974).2
 
*2 The respondent also asserts ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal. We find that respondent did not meet the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The instant claim of ineffective assistance does not comply with Lozada’s requirement that the claim be supported by an affidavit by the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement between himself and his legal representative and what actions were to be taken on his behalf. Furthermore, the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. at 561-62. This means that it is likely that the respondent would have prevailed at the hearing had the negligent representation not occurred. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that the failure to advise a non-citizen criminal defendant that a plea could result in his deportation constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and violates his right to counsel.

2

The respondent has not filed a motion to remand with evidence that his efforts to secure post-conviction relief have been successful.

File: AXXX XX3 779 - Los Angeles, CA
April 25, 2018
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ayda Rashidian, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent timely appeals from the Immigration Judge’s November 11, 2017, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings based upon ineffective assistance of counsel he received during his hearing on June 26, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed a brief on appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On June 26, 2012, the respondent’s counsel withdrew the respondent’s application for adjustment of status and declined to apply for any other forms of relief. The respondent was then ordered removed. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on October 20, 2017. In that motion, the respondent sought reopening based upon his prior counsel’s ineffective assistance. The respondent sought equitable tolling of the time and numerical limitations for motions to reopen. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent substantially complied with the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), but that reopening was not warranted because the respondent did not exercise due diligence in filing his motion to reopen and did not establish prima facie eligibility for relief, i.e., withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 3).
 
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the credibility determination, made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We will affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent has not established that his former counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence and that he was prejudiced by her performance. See Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent argues that he was prejudiced by his former attorney’s performance because she did not explain to him that asylum (or asylum related relief) was a viable option and that his attorney should have known that he was ineligible for adjustment of status and advised him to pursue withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture instead.
 
The record does not support the respondent’s argument. As highlighted by the respondent on appeal and noted by the Immigration Judge below, the option of asylum (or asylum related relief such as withholding of removal) was discussed during the initial hearing and the respondent’s attorney expressed that although the respondent was generally afraid of returning to Afghanistan and his attorney suggested applying for asylum, the respondent was reluctant to apply (IJ at 3; Respondent’s Brief at 14). Additionally, the letter from the respondent’s former attorney states that she was paid to represent him in an “““adjustment of status case and/or asylum case,” the respondent was informed that he could apply for asylum, and that the option of asylum was discussed. Thus, the evidence of record indicates that the respondent chose not to pursue asylum related relief.
 
*2 The respondent asserts on appeal that he chose to pursue adjustment of status in lieu of asylum related relief because his former attorney advised him that an adjustment of status application would likely be successful. Though pursuing adjustment of status was an unsuccessful tactical decision due to the respondent’s criminal record, the respondent’s eligibility for adjustment of status is not at issue at this time. Rather, the issue is whether the respondent was advised that asylum related relief was an option and if he was given the opportunity to apply for such relief. It appears from the record before us that the respondent was both advised of the option of asylum related relief and that he was given the opportunity to apply for such relief. Indeed, the respondent and the Immigration Judge note that asylum related relief was “““suggested” by the respondent’s former counsel, but that the respondent declined to apply (IJ at 3; Respondent’s Brief at 14). Consequently, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent did not establish that his prior counsel’s performance was prejudicial.
 
Finally, although not explicitly requested, the respondent has not shown that an “exceptional situation” exists that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lorely R. Fernandez
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from a July 7, 2017, Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings.1 We will dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, under the “““clearly erroneous” standard and we review all other issues de novo, including questions of law, discretion, and judgment. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii); Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002).
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was ordered removed on January 29, 1999, departed the United States, and reentered the country in 2000. In May 2017, the respondent moved to reopen his proceedings, more than 18 years after he was ordered removed. The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent’s motion was untimely and that he did not meet the requirements for equitable tolling of the 90-day filing deadline. Given these determinations, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent is precluded from relief due to a “departure bar.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (2017); Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir 2016); (July 7, 2017 IJ Dec. at 1-4).
 
A respondent may file one motion to reopen proceedings within 90 days of a final order. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Here, the respondent did not file an appeal and the Immigration Judge’s January 29, 1999, order became the final decision on the matter. Given that date, the respondent had until approximately April 29, 1999, to file a timely motion to reopen, but he did not file it until May 2017, more than 18 years after the filing deadline. Id. An alien has a statutory right to file a motion to reopen, regardless of whether he has left the United States, provided that the motion meets the time and numerical limitations specified by the Act. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act; Garcia-Carias v. Holder, 697 F.3d 257, 263-64 (5th Cir. 2012).
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that his proceedings should be reopened because his 1998 conviction is no longer considered an aggravated felony and he is not removable as charged. The respondent notes that he was placed in removal proceedings, ordered removed in January 1999, and left the country. However, the respondent stresses that a lawful permanent resident card was issued to him (errantly) in March 1999, after he was ordered removed and departed the country. He was admitted to the United States in 2000 using that mistakenly-issued card, and believed that he was lawfully present in the country. He attempted to renew that lawful permanent resident card in 2008, learned that it had been issued in error, and ultimately was placed into proceedings in the Phoenix Immigration Court in 2010. Those proceedings are still open. The respondent moved the El Paso, Texas, Immigration Court to reopen his original removal proceedings in May 2017.2
 
*2 It is undisputed that the respondent’s motion was not timely filed; the respondent did not move to reopen proceedings until more than 18 years after he was ordered removed. However, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case rests, the 90-day filing deadline may be equitably tolled where a respondent demonstrates that 1) “he has pursued his rights diligently,” and 2) “some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.” Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 2016) (internal citation omitted). The legal authority the respondent relies upon to assert that his conviction no longer rendered him removable was issued in 2001, but the respondent did not move to reopen proceedings on this basis for another 16 years. That is not due diligence.
 
Even presuming, without deciding that the errant March 1999 issuance of a lawful permanent resident card constituted an exceptional circumstance, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not pursue his rights with reasonable diligence after learning in 2010 (at the latest) when he was placed back into proceedings that he was not lawfully present in the United States. The respondent offers no explanation for the 7-year delay in filing the motion to reopen after learning that his lawful permanent resident card was not properly issued. Thus, the respondent has not demonstrated that he warrants an equitable tolling of the 90-day filing deadline. Lugo-Resendez v. Lynch, 831 F.3d at 344.
 
Because the respondent did not file within the time limit or meet the requirements for equitable tolling, his motion does not comply with the requirements for a statutory motion to reopen. Section 240(c)(7) of the Act;; Garcia-Carias v. Holder, 697 F.3d at 263-64. If a respondent does not meet the statutory limitations, an Immigration Judge may exercise its regulatory sua sponte authority to reopen a case. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). However, unlike a statutory motion, a regulatory motion is subject to the “departure bar,” which prohibits motions to reopen “by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b); Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, 330 F.3d 672, 675-76 (5th Cir. 2003). Here, the Immigration Judge could not exercise sua sponte authority because the respondent left the United States in January 1999 after a final order of removal, and thus the regulatory “““departure bar” applies. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); see also Ovalles v. Holder, 577 F.3d 288, 296-97 (5th Cir. 2009) (upholding Board’s determination that it lacked sua sponte authority to reopen case due to regulatory departure bar, where alien’s motion was untimely and he thus had no statutory right to have his motion heard). For these reasons, we will affirm the denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
*3 Finally, the respondent mentions in passing that, if the Board concludes that counsel may have been ineffective by not moving to reopen sooner, we should remand the record to the Immigration Judge to allow counsel to withdraw so that the respondent can retain “new counsel and file a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel” (Respondent’s Br. at 9). We do not sua sponte review the record for ineffective assistance of counsel. Instead, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be supported by (1) an affidavit from the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel regarding the matters the attorney was retained to address, (2) documentary evidence that the counsel in question was informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond, and (3) proof that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to the alleged ineffective assistance (and if this is not filed, why it was not). Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).
 
Here, the respondent did not comply with any of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 639. Indeed, counsel did not expressly assert that he was ineffective or provide any other relevant information regarding the filing of the motion to reopen. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit requires strict compliance with Lozada in order to put forth an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Hernandez-Ortez v. Holder, 741 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 2014). Thus, we will not address this issue further.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be issued.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent came to the United States on or about September 09, 1982, as a lawful permanent resident. On December 7, 1998, the respondent was convicted in the 70th Judicial District Court, Ector County, Texas, for the offense of driving while intoxicated, third offense, in violation of TEX. PENAL CODE § 49.09, for which he received a sentence of 5 years. On January 29, 1999, the respondent was ordered removed to Mexico during an in-person hearing, after being found removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), for having committed an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43). The respondent did not apply for relief and waived appeal (Exhs. 1, 1A, 2; January 29, 1999 IJ Dec. at 1).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven A. Mundie, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s September 18, 2017, decision denying his motion to reconsider the August 23, 2017, denial of his motion to reopen and rescind a December 1, 2014, in absentia removal order. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
This Board must defer to the Immigration Judge’s factual findings, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, unless they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent has not identified a factual or legal error in the Immigration Judge’s August 23, 2017, decision denying his motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C) (a motion to reconsider shall specify the errors or law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority); Matter of 0-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). The respondent’s appellate brief is almost identical in content to his July 31, 2017, motion to reopen. The respondent argues therein that it was improper to serve the Notice to Appear on him because he was a 16-year-old minor at the time. The respondent urges this court to “overrule its current precedent” and follow Flores-Chavez v. Ashcroft, 362 F.2d 1150 (9th Cir. 2004), which provides that if an alien under the age of 18 is released into the custody of an adult, the Notice to Appear should be served on the adult as well as the alien.
 
We decline to do so. We have held that outside the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, personal service of a Notice to Appear on a minor who is 14 years of age or older at the time of service is effective, and that the regulations do not require that notice also be served on an adult with responsibility for the minor. Matter of Cubor-Cruz, 25 I&N Dec. 470 (BIA 2011) (declining to follow Flores-Chavez v. Ashcroft). Therefore, in this case arising in the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the respondent was properly served the Notice to Appear. See Matter of Cubor-Cruz, 25 I&N Dec. at 473, n.3 (noting that the Second Circuit sought publication on this issue in Llanos-Fernandez v. Mukasey, 535 F.3d 79, 86 (2d Cir. 2008), but that subsequent proceedings in the case rendered it moot). The respondent has also not rebutted the presumption of proper delivery of the hearing notice notifying him of the December 1, 2014, court date, because he was personally served the Notice to Appear and the notice of hearing was sent to his last known address care of his aunt in Jamaica, New York (Exhs. 1, 4). See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). The record does not reflect that the hearing notice was returned as undeliverable. Accordingly, the respondent has not demonstrated that his case should be reopened due to lack of notice. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
*2 We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not identify any factual or legal errors in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not establish that exceptional circumstances warrant granting his untimely motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order (9/18/17 IJ Dec. at 2). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent contends that his aunt received the hearing notice, but threw it away. In her August 23, 2017, decision, the Immigration Judge properly found that the respondent had not presented adequate evidence that his aunt threw away the notice, noting that the respondent did not submit a sworn declaration attesting to his version of events, or a statement from his mother or aunt who had knowledge of the situation (9/18/17 IJ Dec. at 2; 8/23/17 IJ Dec. at 2).1 The Immigration Judge also noted that the respondent, who knew he was in removal proceedings in 2014, did not act with due diligence (8/23/17 IJ Dec. at 2). The respondent has not meaningfully challenged these findings on appeal. Nor does the respondent meaningfully challenge the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not articulated a valid ineffective assistance of counsel claim (9/18/17 IJ Dec. at 2).2 As previously stated, the respondent’s appellate brief is almost identical in content to his July 31, 2017, motion to reopen, and solely focuses on the Flores-Chavez v. Ashcroft issue. We therefore deem the exceptional circumstances and ineffective assistance of counsel issues waived and will not further address them. See Matter of G-G-S-, 26 I&N Dec. 339, 340 n.2 (BIA 2014), overruled on other grounds by Gomez-Sanchez v. Sessions, 2018 WL 1661652 (9th Cir, Apr. 6.2018)
 
In his motion to reconsider, the respondent sought reopening to apply for asylum and related relief and protection from removal based on changed country conditions in Guatemala (Motion to Reconsider at 5-8). 8 C.F.R. 1003.23(b)(4)(i). He also argued that sua sponte reopening was warranted because he has a United States citizen son (IJ at 8-10). The Immigration Judge rejected the respondent’s arguments, and the respondent has not meaningfully challenged these findings on appeal. We therefore deem these issues waived and will not further address them. See Matter of G-G-S-, 26 I&N Dec. at 340 n.2
 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider the August 23, 2017, decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind the December 1, 2014, in absentia order. The respondent has not identified any error of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s August 23, 2017, decision.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lisa Pickering, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jordan, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on December 4, 2012, after not appearing at her hearing. She filed a motion to reopen on February 20, 2013, alleging insufficient notice, which the Immigration Judge denied on June 5, 2013.1 On October 17, 2017, the respondent submitted a second motion to reopen, and appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 26, 2017, denying the motion.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that “exceptional circumstances,” to wit, ineffective assistance of counsel, prevented her appearance at the hearing, inasmuch as her former attorney did not notify her of the court date (Respondent’s Br. at 8-12). See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C) (providing that a motion to reopen based on “exceptional circumstances,” as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1), must be filed within 180 days of the removal order). The respondent filed her October 17, 2017, motion more than 180 days after the hearing. It is therefore untimely. Moreover, the motion is number-barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
In addition, we decline to equitably toll the time and number requirements. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 677 (9th Cir. 2011) (requiring for equitable tolling that an alien acted with “due” or “reasonable” diligence in discovering any “deception, fraud, or error” that prevented an alien from timely filing a motion). Initially, the respondent has not satisfied the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598 (9th Cir. 2004) (stating that an alien’s letter of complaint to a bar association about a former attorney did not substantially comply with the Lozada requirement that an alien notify former attorney of an ineffective assistance allegation and give the attorney an adequate opportunity to respond). The respondent has submitted evidence that she has filed a complaint against former counsel with a state bar association. However, she has not established that she notified former counsel that she had accused him of ineffective assistance of counsel in proceedings before the Immigration Court.
 
*2 Furthermore, the respondent states in her bar complaint that she obtained a copy of her file from former counsel in May 2016. Presumably, the respondent was then aware that the Immigration Judge had denied her first motion to reopen and no appeal was filed from that decision. However, the respondent waited until October 17, 2017, to file her second motion to reopen. Hence, the respondent did not act with due diligence. In light of the foregoing, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s October 17, 2017, motion to reopen based on untimeliness.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The Immigration Judge correctly concluded that an alien is properly notified of a hearing if the Immigration Court sends a Notice of Hearing to the alien’s counsel. See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (requiring notice to be provided to counsel of record).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Katherine M. Dittmeier Holm, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on February 20, 2018, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of her request for a continuance. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings on March 9, 2018. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion, which will be granted.
 
The respondent’s motion is supported by evidence that the Jefferson Circuit Court, Commonwealth of Kentucky, has withdrawn the respondent’s guilty plea underlying her conviction pursuant to K.R.S. § 514.030, based on due process violations regarding ineffective assistance of counsel. Given the evidence presented, we find that the respondent’s vacated conviction may not be considered a conviction for immigration purposes. Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 1006); Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003). Inasmuch as this conviction is the sole conviction underlying her removability, we find that the respondent is no longer removable as charged. Accordingly, we will grant the respondent’s unopposed motion, and terminate the respondent’s proceedings.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted, and the proceedings are terminated without prejudice.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Peter E. Torres, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent moves the Board to reconsider our October 25, 2017, decision dismissing her appeal from the Immigration Judge’s June 20, 2017, decision denying her untimely, number-barred motion to reopen.1 See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The motion will be denied.
 
In her prior motion to reopen, filed before the Immigration Judge on June 2, 2017, the respondent alleged ineffective assistance of counsel on the part of an attorney who filed an application for prosecutorial discretion on her behalf in 2014, asserting that the attorney failed to submit an application for asylum and withholding of removal (Form I-589) to the Immigration Judge. In his decision, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had previously filed a motion to reopen that was denied on May 9, 2014, and that the respondent waited 3 years thereafter to file her second motion to reopen. In our prior order, we found that the respondent did not establish that she suffered prejudice as the result of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
In the instant motion, the respondent asserts that she substantially complied with the requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988). However, although the respondent may have offered a statement in support of the motion, the statement did not set forth the terms of the attorney’s representation. Thus, the respondent not only failed to comply with the Lozada requirements, she has not shown that that the failure to submit a Form I-589 was the result of any error on the part of counsel. Id. The respondent, therefore, failed to show that her former attorney’s handling of her case resulted in prejudice. Further, the respondent, who was represented by a third attorney upon the filing of her first motion to reopen in 2014, did not show that she exercised due diligence in discovering the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Indeed, she has not explained the delay in bringing the matter before the Immigration Judge 3 years after the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel occurred. Under the circumstances, neither equitable tolling of the filing deadline nor reopening sua sponte was warranted. See Akwada v. Ashcroft, 113 F. App’x 532, 538-39 (4th Cir. 2004). See also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
*2 In sum, we find no error of fact or law in our prior order to warrant reconsideration. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). Accordingly, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marisa-Andrea L. Moore, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed from the decision of the Immigration Judge dated August 17, 2017, denying her motion to reopen the proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against her on July 10, 2013. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The respondent received proper notice of her removal hearing. On April 8, 2012, the respondent was personally served with the Notice to Appear (“NTA”) and, thus, was aware she had been placed in removal proceedings (IJ at 1, 3; Exh. 1). See Matter of Cubor-Cruz, 25 I&N Dec. 470 (BIA 2011) (personal service of an NTA on a minor who is 14 years of age or older at the time of service is effective). The NTA informed the respondent of her obligation to keep her address updated with the court as well as the consequences of failing to appear at a hearing (IJ at 3-4; Exh. 1). Section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(B); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.15(b)(7), 1003.15(d).
 
On January 11, 2013, the notice of hearing was properly mailed to the respondent’s last known address, which was that of her father (Exh. 3). Sections 239(a)(1)(F), 239(c), and 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229(a)(1)(F), 1229(c), and 1229a(b)(5)(A); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.13, 1003.26(d). The respondent had moved from that address in May 2012 and did not comply with the statutory address obligations by providing a current address pursuant to section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act (IJ at 3-4; Exh. 4; Motion at Tab A, no. 13). For aliens not in detention, written notices of hearing are not required if the alien has failed to provide the address required under section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act. Sections 239(a)(2)(B) and 240(b)(5)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(d). Because the notice of hearing was mailed to the respondent’s last known address and she failed to provide the court with her current address, she received proper notice of her hearing.
 
*2 With respect to the respondent’s claim of exceptional circumstances, her motion is untimely because she did not file her motion within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s decision.1 Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The Immigration Judge properly declined to equitably toll the applicable filing requirements. The doctrine of equitable tolling excuses an alien’s untimely motion if she can show that “despite diligent efforts, she did not discover the injury until after the limitations period had expired.” Barry v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 721, 724 (6th Cir 2008) (quotation omitted). “Equitable tolling may apply when a petitioner has received ineffective assistance of counsel.” Mezo v Holder, 615 F.3d 616, 620 (6th Cir. 2010). The respondent must show that she diligently pursued her rights and was prejudiced by counsel’s ineffective assistance. Mezo v Holder, 615 F.3d at 620. Prejudice means that “but for counsel’s error, [the respondent] would have been entitled to continue residing in the United States.” Hulcochea-Gomez v INS, 237 F.3d 696, 699-700 (6th Cir. 2001).
 
Here, equitable tolling is not warranted. The respondent’s vague statements about consulting with an unnamed attorney to get her immigration paperwork are insufficient to establish a claim to ineffective assistance of counsel (IJ at 5; Motion at Tab A, nos. 19, 20). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.3d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The Immigration Judge properly rejected the respondent’s claim that her minority and the irresponsibility of her guardian (her father) constitute an exceptional circumstance (IJ at 5). The respondent was an adult at the time of the Immigration Judge’s July 10, 2013, decision, and her father’s filing of a Missing Juvenile Report with the police and hiring of an attorney to file a Form EOIR-33 indicating the respondent’s address was “unknown” after she ran away, do not support her claim (IJ at 5; Exh. 4). Moreover, even if the respondent tried unsuccessfully to get her immigration paperwork from her father, she does not claim to have contacted the Immigration Court to ask about the status of her case or any scheduled hearings or to provide her new address (Motion at Tab A, nos. 16-18, Tab B at nos. 8-9, Tab C at no. 10, Tab J, Tab L at 8-12). The respondent has not shown that she diligently pursued her rights.
 
Nor has the respondent shown that the application of the extraordinary remedy of sua sponte reopening is warranted. Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). A removal hearing is reopened sua sponte only in “exceptional circumstances” and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. at 984. The respondent has not presented exceptional circumstances which would merit sua sponte reopening of the proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.2
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent filed her motion on July 14, 2017, more than 3 years after the 180-day deadline for a motion based on exceptional circumstances had passed.

2

The respondent submitted a Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal with her motion (Motion at Tab O). A motion to reopen may be filed at any time if the alien is seeking asylum or withholding of removal based on changed country conditions arising in the country of the alien’s nationality or the country to which the alien is to be removed. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161 (BIA 2013). The respondent did not claim changed country conditions in her motion or on appeal. Therefore, we will not further address this issue.

We review an Immigration Judge’s factual determinations, including credibility determinations, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board uses a de novo standard of review for questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The Immigration Judge made the following findings of fact without clear error. The respondent first appeared at a May 2015 master calendar hearing and stated that Spanish was his best language (IJ at 2). Thereafter, he appeared with counsel on June 22, 2016, admitted all factual allegations, conceded the charge of removal arising under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and was granted until February 2017 to seek prosecutorial discretion or apply for relief (IJ at 2). At the next hearing, the respondent appeared with two attorneys, sought to substitute counsel, and stated that he only spoke a little Spanish, and that the language he spoke and understood best was Mixteco (IJ at 2-3). At the next master calendar hearing on March 10, 2017, the respondent appeared with new counsel and filed a motion to withdraw his plea, to suppress evidence, and to terminate proceedings (IJ at 3). In support of that motion, the respondent submitted a declaration made under penalty of perjury wherein he states that he ditcated the declaration in Spanish, his native language, that he was pulled over by immigration officers in February 2015 while driving lawfully, that he did not feel free to leave once pulled over, and that he was not provided with evidence against him or told how to “““fight his case” when he first appeared before the Immigration Judge (IJ at 3, Exh. 7B).
 
The Notice to Appear was personally served on the respondent on February 19, 2015, upon his arrest after a traffic stop (Exhs. 1, 7A). The respondent’s motion to terminate is based on his argument that evidence of his alienage, as set forth in, inter alia, the Form I-213, Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien (Exh. 7A), was obtained by the Department of Homeland Security (“the DHS”) via an egregious violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. In his declaration in support of his motion, the respondent stated that he was “not breaking any laws or causing any disturbances” when he was stopped by the officers (Exh. 7B). The I-213 indicated that the respondent was driving a “““target vehicle” identified by make, model, color, and license plate (Exh. 7B). The vehicle was stopped, the respondent was identified by a Mexican identification card, and he admitted his Mexican nationality (Id).
 
*2 In removal proceedings, an alien seeking the exclusion of evidence based on the Fourth Amendment bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case that evidence should be suppressed. Matter of Tang, 13 I&N Dec. 691 (BIA 1971). While the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is generally inapplicable to deportation proceedings, this rule may be applied if there are egregious Fourth Amendment violations that transgress Fifth Amendment notions of fundamental fairness, undermining the probative value of the evidence. See also Matter of Sandoval, 17 I&N Dec. 70 (BIA 1979); Matter of Garcia, 17 I&N Dec. 319, 321 (BIA 1980) (respondent made prima facie showing that admissions were given involuntarily and the government presented no contrary evidence; proceedings terminated); Matter of Tow, 17 I&N Dec. 340, 343 (BIA 1980). The request to exclude evidence should be made via a motion to suppress that is supported by an affidavit or other objective evidence that explains why suppression is appropriate. Matter of Barcenas, 19 I&N Dec. 609 (BIA 1988); Matter of Wong, 13 I&N Dec. 820, 822 (BIA 1971). When an alien has come forward with adequate evidence in support of suppression, the burden shifts to the DHS to justify the manner in which it obtained the evidence. Matter of Barcenas, 19 I&N Dec. at 611. However, the identity of an alien (as distinguished from alienage) is not suppressible, even if it is conceded that an illegal arrest, search, or interrogation occurred. See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1051 (1984); Matter of Cervantes-Torres, 21 I&N Dec. 351, 353 (BIA 1996) (alien’s previously-submitted application for work authorization could be submitted as evidence of alienage even if egregious arrest occurred).
 
In this case, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s finding that the record does not contain evidence to support the respondent’s contention that the evidence of his alienage was obtained via an egregious violation of his Fourth Amendment rights (IJ at 5). The record lacks evidence that the respondent was targeted for an inappropriate reason such as race or that he did not voluntarily admit to his alienage (Id). Therefore, the burden did not shift to the DHS to justify the way that it obtained the evidence of the respondent’s alienage. Because no prima facie evidence of an egregious violation of the Fourth Amendment has been proffered, we reject the respondent’s contention that he should have been permitted to confront the author of the I-213 (Respondent’s Br. at 12)1
 
*3 To the extent that the respondent argues on appeal that his prior counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel and his plea should be withdrawn based on this, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s determination that this allegation has not been supported by adequate evidence or by adherence to the procedural prerequisites to making such a claim (IJ at 4-5). See Respondent’s Br. at 5-6. As noted, the respondent’s claim not to have understood prior proceedings in which his alienage and removability were admitted is undermined by his preparation of an affidavit in the Spanish language (IJ at 5-6). Furthermore, although the respondent argues on appeal that he did not know of the evidence against him and would not have conceded the removal charge, he has not shown that his attorney’s decision to concede this charge was ineffective assistance, since there is no evidence in the record reflecting that he is not an alien or that he has any right to remain in the United States. Cf. Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931 (9th Cir. 1986) (finding that the decision to forego contesting deportability in favor of a generous grant of voluntary departure is a tactical choice). He also has not complied with the procedural steps-such as notifying former counsel or filing a claim with relevant bar authorities-which we have indicated are a prerequisite for making such a claim. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We therefore find no cause to disturb the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to terminate or to withdraw his concession of the charges based on due process violations stemming from ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Finally, for the reasons stated by the Immigration Judge, including but not limited to the fact that the respondent unlawfully re-entered the United States after his nine prior voluntary returns, we affirm the denial of the respondent’s application for voluntary departure.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the appeal will be dismissed on the entry of the following order.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

An updated I-213 reflects that the respondent’s vehicle was targeted because he previously had been convicted of driving under the influence and had been identified as a fugitive based on his unlawful entries following his nine prior voluntary returns from the United States (IJ at 6; Exh. 10).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joshua A. Berman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Billy J. Sapp
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Continuance; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s October 23, 2017, decision finding him inadmissible for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, as set forth at section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), and denying his request for a continuance to pursue related post-conviction relief. During the pendency of the appeal, he also filed an unopposed motion to remand the record to the Immigration Judge.1 The motion will be granted, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and the entry of a new decision.2
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
The respondent entered the United States without inspection (IJ at 1; Tr. at 3-4; Exh. 1). Then, on September 27, 2016, he was convicted of reckless endangerment in violation of Md. Crim. Code § 3-204(a)(1) (2003), committed in March 2016, and for which he was sentenced to 18 months of confinement (IJ at 1-2; Tr. at 3-4; Exhs. 1, 2). The Immigration Judge concluded that the reckless endangerment conviction was a conviction for a categorical crime involving moral turpitude, and thus, that the respondent was inadmissible as charged pursuant to section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act (IJ at 1-2). Matter of Silva-Trevino III, 26 I&N Dec. 826, 830 (BIA 2016).
 
During the pendency of this appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand accompanied by an order and memorandum opinion dated February 22, 2018, from the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court vacating the underlying conviction and entering a judgment of acquittal based on the criminal court’s finding of ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Unopposed Motion to Remand at Tab B).
 
The respondent’s motion to remand is based on new previously unavailable evidence material to the Immigration Judge’s decision to sustain the charge brought under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act (IJ at 1-2). See Matter of Coehlo, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992) (explaining that the same substantive requirements apply to motions to remand that apply to motions to reopen); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (outlining the substantive requirements for motions to reopen); see also Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003) (holding that where a conviction is vacated based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, and not solely for immigration hardships or rehabilitation purposes, the respondent no longer has a “conviction” under section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A)). The respondent conceded below that the conviction also precluded him from pursuing certain forms of relief from removal, such as cancellation of removal for certain non-lawful permanent residents pursuant to section 240A(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b) (Tr. at 9-10, 16, 18; Respondent’s Motion to Remand at 2).
 
*2 Thus, we conclude that remand of the record is appropriate to allow the Immigration Judge to address the impact of the vacatur in the first instance. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002) (explaining that the Board has limited fact-finding authority on appeal); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is granted and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7).

The Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s request for post-conclusion voluntary departure pursuant to section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b), conditioned on the posting of a bond (IJ at 2-3). The respondent has provided proof on appeal that he posted the required bond. However, in light of our remand of the record, we need not reinstate the grant of voluntary departure at this juncture.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Benjamin T. Wiesinger, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brent Landis
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
REISSUED DECISION
 
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). He seeks reissuance of the Board’s March 8, 2017, decision dismissing his appeal. The respondent’s counsel avers that they provided ineffective assistance of counsel by contracting to prepare and file a petition for review, but neglected to do so.1 The Department of Homeland Security was granted an extension of time to file a response, but has not filed an objection. In light of counsel’s admissions, as well as the other evidence presented, the motion to reopen and reissue is granted. See Dearinger ex re. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir. 2000). The grant of voluntary departure will again be reinstated. Accordingly, the following orders will be issued.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen and reissue is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated March 8, 2017, attached hereto, is hereby reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
*2 WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen and terminate these removal proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion.
 
With the instant motion, the respondent has proffered evidence that the 2008 Maryland state conviction that formed the sole basis for his removability has been vacated due to ineffective assistance of counsel (Motion to Reopen, Exh. B; see also Board Dec. dated Jan. 11, 2018; IJ Dec. dated July 31, 2017; Admin Record, Exh. 1). Based on the proffered evidence, we hereby grant the respondent’s motion to reopen. See Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621, 624 (BIA 2003) (holding that a conviction that has been vacated by the criminal court based upon a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings is no longer a conviction for immigration purposes). These proceedings are hereby reopened, and terminated without prejudice.

IN RE: LAKHWINDER SINGH
File: AXXX XX8 712 - Boston, MA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Georges S. Zeidan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 19, 2017, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his application for adjustment of status. The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider and request for a stay of removal with the Board. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The motion and stay will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider shall specify “errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of 0-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The respondent’s motion does not establish any error in our previous decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent did not testify and dismissing his appeal.
 
To the extent that the respondent is attempting to raise new arguments related to his application for adjustment status, these arguments are not properly raised for the first time in a motion to reconsider. See 0-S-G-, 20 I&N Dec. at 58 (stating that “[a] motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied” and “arguments for consideration on appeal should all be submitted at one time, rather than in piecemeal fashion.”) (citation omitted). A motion to reconsider is neither a vehicle for advancing supplemental legal arguments that could have been previously raised nor a mechanism for submitting a late-filed brief. Moreover, we are not persuaded that the respondent’s supplemental arguments regarding the nature of his marriage and his new allegation that his marriage has been over since 2012 establishes any error in the Board’s or Immigration Judge’s decision. Disagreement with the result is not sufficient. Therefore, the motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is more in the nature of a timely motion to reopen. Applicable regulations provide that a motion to reopen “shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). A motion to reopen must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief “and all supporting documentation.” Id. In addition, where an alien seeks to apply for relief for which he or she has previously been provided an opportunity to apply at the former hearing, a showing of changed circumstances since the time of the hearing must be made. Id. Moreover, the movant must establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 319 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05 (1988).
 
*2 The respondent alleges for the first time that his marriage has been deteriorating since 2012 and attributes the adverse credibility finding to the state of his marriage (Motion at 4-5; Exh. A). He further argues that his counsel made a “good faith error” in not arguing that the marriage was bona fide at inception (Motion at 5).
 
To the extent the respondent is arguing that he is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not complied with any of the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).1 Regardless, the respondent has failed to explain why neither he nor his wife mentioned the deterioration of their marriage in their extensive testimony.
 
Finally, the evidence submitted along with the respondent’s motion, his own affidavit attesting to the deterioration of his marriage, is neither new nor previously unavailable and the respondent has not explained why he did not mention this at his hearing below. Thus, the respondent has not submitted persuasive new or previously unavailable evidence that is sufficient to meet his “heavy burden” of showing that it is likely that the result would change if the proceedings were reopened. See generally Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Therefore, we do not find that he has met his burden of showing that reopening of these proceedings is warranted.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

Under Matter of Lozada, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must satisfy the following procedural requirements: (1) an affidavit of the alien attesting to the relevant facts, including a detailed description of the agreement with former counsel, (2) former counsel must be informed of the allegations and provided with an opportunity to respond, and (3) indicate whether a complaint has been filed the appropriate disciplinary authority, and if not, why not.
