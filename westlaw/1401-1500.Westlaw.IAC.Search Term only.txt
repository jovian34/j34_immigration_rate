IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sandra Greene, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Termination
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s November 6, 2007, decision finding him removable under section 237(a)(2XA)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. He also moves to remand, asserting that his trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance in conceding his removability (Tr. at 20-21). The Department of Homeland Security has not filed an appeal brief or a response to the motion to remand. The motion will be granted, and the case will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The respondent has complied with the evidentiary requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).¿FN1º SeeLu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 132 (3rd Cir. 2001) (approving the Lozada requirements). In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance, the Third Circuit has stated that an alien “must demonstrate prejudice, he ‘must show that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.”’ Ponce-Leiva v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 369, 377 (3rd Cir. 2002), citing Uspango v. Asheroft, 289 F.3d 226, 231 (3rd Cir. 2002).
 
We conclude that the respondent has established a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We find that a competent attorney would have challenged the respondent’s removability based on the aggravated felony charge listed in the Notice to Appear. As the respondent outlines in his appeal brief, there are arguable issues as to whether the DHS met its burden of establishing that the respondent’s bank fraud conviction involved a loss to a victim or victims exceeding $10,000 to constitute an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(M) of the Act. Because the respondent “was prevented from reasonably presenting his case,” we find that he established the requisite prejudice to support a remand for a hearing on removability. See Ponce-Leiva v. Ashcroft, supra.
 
Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s November 6, 2007, decision will be vacated, the motion to remand will be granted, and the case remanded to Immigration Court for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s November 6, 2007, decision is hereby vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael Wishnie, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Angela Marra
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on December 7, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s August 23, 2007, decision denying her motion to reconsider the Immigration Judge’s June 27, 2007, denial of her motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against her on June 5, 1997. The respondent has now filed a motion to reconsider and/or reopen with the Board. The motions are denied.
 
Through her current motion to reconsider, the respondent contends that the Board erred in our December 7, 2007, decision dismissing her appeal because (1) the Board did not address her claim of lack of notice for her June 5, 1997, hearing; (2) the Board did not address her ineffective assistance of counsel claim insofar as she claims that she exhibited due diligence in pursuing her motion to reopen and rescind; and, (3) the Board failed to address the denial of her request to file for asylum based upon changed country conditions in her motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge. See Respondent’s Motion at 9-21. Further, the respondent contends that a motion to reopen has been granted to pursue asylum in her removal proceedings filed under a different alien number and name.¿FN1º Id. As a result, she alleges that the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is “estopped” from re-litigating the issue in these proceedings. Id. at 10-11.
 
First, we point out that the entirety of the Board’s December 7, 2007, decision in this case was dedicated to the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and lack of notice. In fact, we specifically stated that the respondent argued both a lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel based upon her contention that her prior counsel acted ineffectively by failing to provide her notice of her June 5, 1997, hearing and the possibility of the entry of an in absentia removal order should she fail to appear. See Board’s December 7, 2007, Decision at 3. In this regard, we ultimately concluded that the respondent failed to establish that she exercised due diligence in pursuing her case where she waited 10 years to file a motion to reopen after departing the United States for years with the knowledge that her original motion to reopen was granted in 1997. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000). As a result, the respondent’s assertion that the Board failed to address her lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel claims is wholly without merit.
 
*2 Moreover, the record reflects that the respondent did not appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision regarding her request to file an application for asylum based upon alleged changed country conditions in Nicaragua. Rather, the respondent’s Notice of Appeal and appellate brief before the Board argued only the denial of her motion to rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against her. Thus, the respondent cannot now argue that the Board committed legal and/or factual error in failing to adjudicate an appellate claim that she never raised. In light of the foregoing, the respondent’s motion for reconsideration will be denied for her failure to sustain her burden in establishing that the Board committed factual and/or legal errors in our December 7, 2007, decision dismissing her prior appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 (2007).
 
We now turn to the respondent’s current motion to reopen to apply for asylum based upon alleged changed country conditions in Nicaragua. Here, we note that there is no time limit on the filing of a motion to reopen if the basis of the motion is to apply for relief under section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, and is based upon changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered. See section 240(d)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(d)(C)(ii). However, the respondent has not filed an asylum application with her motion to demonstrate that she has a well-founded fear of persecution based upon those changed conditions. Consequently, the respondent has failed to establish prima facie eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal, and we see no reason to remand these proceedings.¿FN2º
 
Accordingly, the motion are denied.

The record reflects that the respondent was ordered removed from the United States in absentia in separate proceedings under a different alien number and name because she reentered the United States in 2001 under a false name.

We find it unnecessary to address the respondent’s contentions regarding whether the DHS is estopped from opposing her motion to reopen based upon changed country conditions inasmuch as the DHS did not oppose her motion on this basis. Therefore, the issue is moot.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Adam S. Elman, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(l)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)º - Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
In a decision dated November 1, 2006, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent has appealed that decision. The appeal is dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed on September 8, 2005, more than 90 days after the respondent was ordered removed on July 2, 2001. See 8C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). Moreover, the Immigration Judge did not find that exceptional circumstances were present, even if such circumstances could justify the untimeliness of the respondent’s motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent failed to demonstrate that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, because he did not satisfy any of the procedural requirements for attorney negligence as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1stCir. 1988), nor has he explained his failure to do so (I.J. at 4, 5). Failure to meet the Lozada requirements will usually be fatal to the claim. See Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996) (discussion of policy considerations underlying Lozada requirements); aff’d Rivera v. INS, 122 F. 3d 1062 (4th Cir. 1997). The respondent refers to the Ninth Circuit case, Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000), and contends that strict adherence to the Lozada requirements is not required when the record of ineffective assistance of counsel is legitimate and substantial. At the outset, we note that this case arises in the jurisdiction of the First Circuit, and the respondent has not shown that the First Circuit has adopted the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit in Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra. The First Circuit has held that the Lozada requirements may be applied as long as the court does not arbitrarily demand adherence to them. Saakian v. INS, 252 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2001); I.J. at 4.¿FN1º Here, the failure to satisfy any of the Lozada requirements is fatal to this claim. Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 2004). Because the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed untimely, the appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Victoria Calle, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Corine Dominguez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision dated December 6, 2007. Therein, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his motion to reopen an order of removal entered in absentia on June 29, 1999. The record will be remanded.
 
A motion to reconsider is a “request that the Board reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked.” Matter of Ramos, 23 I&N Dec. 336, 338 (BIA 2002) (quoting Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 n.2 (BIA 1991)). A motion to reconsider challenges the Board’s original decision and alleges that it is defective in some regard. Matter of Cerna, supra, at 402. A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based on the previous factual record, as opposed to a motion to reopen, which seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. Id at 403; see also section 240(c)(7)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) and Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
The respondent argues in his motion that the Board incorrectly concluded that he was notified of the hearing. He states that his former counsel withdrew as his representative on May 19, 1999, and that he did not receive a notice of hearing either from his former counsel or from the court. The respondent further argues that there is no proof that the Immigration Court actually mailed the Notice of Hearing to him. In addition, the respondent argues in his motion that the Board incorrectly determined that he failed to satisfy the procedural requirements for showing ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). He contends that former counsel was notified of the complaint filed against him with the Texas Bar Association as a part of the bar complaint process.
 
We find in light of the allegation of non-receipt of the hearing notice that it is appropriate to remand these proceedings to the Immigration Judge to more fully address whether the respondent was adequately notified of the hearing. See Maknojiya v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 588, 589 (5th Cir. 2005) (noting the lower burden required for rebutting the presumption of delivery for correspondence sent by regular mail was met where both alien and his counsel submitted affidavits indicating that they did not receive the notice that reset the hearing from an earlier hearing date than originally scheduled). In addition, the record reflects that the Immigration Judge did not address the issue of whether the respondent was victimized by the negligence of his former counsel, Mr. Rosenbloom. We find it appropriate for the Immigration Judge to render the initial findings of fact on the issue.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is granted, and these proceedings are remanded for further proceedings.

*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º -In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Cameroon, appeals an Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 21, 2006. On August 4, 2006, the respondent failed to appear for a hearing pursuant to a notice mailed to his address on June 22, 2006, and the Immigration Judge ordered him removed to Cameroon in absentia (I.J. at 2). On September 1, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to rescind the removal order and reopen proceedings with the Immigration Judge alleging that he failed to appear for the Immigration Court hearing due to a lack of notice. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). Following the Immigration Judge’s September 21, 2006, denial of the respondent’s motion, the respondent filed a timely appeal with the Board. The request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7). The respondent’s appeal will be sustained and the removal proceedings will be reopened.
 
As an initial matter, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion upon concluding that the respondent failed to show — either through an affidavit or other evidence — that he did not receive notice of the August 4, 2006, hearing (I.J. at 2-3). Although the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent did not rebut the presumption of effective delivery, we find that the removal order should be rescinded. First, we note that the respondent initiated correspondence with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as a result of his prior submission of his asylum application, which was confirmed by the DHS arresting officer in his notation in the Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien. As a result, the respondent arguably had little motive to avoid the scheduled hearing (Respondent’s Br. at 1, 6). See generally Lopes v. Gonzales, 468 F.3d 81, 86 (2d Cir. 2006) (remanding, in part, because the Board did not consider all relevant evidence offered to rebut the presumption of delivery, including the fact that the petitioner — through the filing of an application for a labor certification — initiated a proceeding to obtain a benefit, which makes it less likely that he would ignore, or have such motive to, an immigration proceeding for which he had notice); see also Alrefae v. Chertoff, 471 F.3d 353, 359 (2d Cir. 2006). Also, the respondent did not delay in seeking a reopening of the proceedings as he, upon receiving the in absentia removal order, apparently retained Mr. Mark Kenmore as his counsel, who filed the motion on September 1, 2006.
 
*2 In addition, while not discussed in the Immigration Judge’s decision, the DHS in this matter did not oppose the respondent’s motion to rescind the removal order and reopen proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 2). Indeed, as evidenced through the DHS’s statement on appeal, it continues to assert its non-opposition to the respondent’s motion (Respondent’s Br. at 3, 6). Moreover, as indicated in the respondent’s brief, the respondent’s prior attorney, Mr. Kenmore, may have rendered ineffective assistance to the respondent prior to his withdrawal of the case (Respondent’s Br. at 3-4). Although the respondent has not satisfied the procedural requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, he suggests that such defective representation is apparent from the record as Mr. Kenmore — despite suffering from cognitive difficulties and memory problems and being under the care of a neurologist since June 2006 — continued to represent the respondent before the Immigration Judge and the Board. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Also, the respondent offers the fact that no supporting documentation was provided with the motion to the Immigration Judge as further evidence of such inadequate representation.¿FN1º
 
Therefore, we will sustain the respondent’s appeal, vacate the Immigration Judge’s decision, and rescind the in absentia order. As we find that the proceedings should be reopened, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings as may be appropriate under the circumstances. See Matter of Patel, 16 I&N Dec. 600 (BIA 1978). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is hereby remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order.

Although the respondent now presents sworn affidavits from himself and his uncle attesting to the non-delivery of the June 22, 2006, notice (Respondent’s Br. at 5-6), we note that the Board may not accept such documents into the record as it is precluded from engaging in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Geoffrey A. Hoffman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
David J. Kelly
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Section 212(c) waiver
 
This case was last before us on May 28, 2003, when we remanded the record of proceedings to the Immigration Judge to consider the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), in light of INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). On February 13, 2007, the Immigration Judge pretermitted the respondent’s application for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act. The respondent now appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 13, 2007, decision. The respondent has also filed a motion to remand in order to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) filed an opposition to the respondent’s motion to remand. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and his motion to remand will be denied. Additionally, the respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7).
 
On appeal, the respondent does not contest that he was convicted by a jury for the offense of criminal possession of marijuana in the fourth degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree. Instead, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge was bound by the law of our May 28, 2003, remand to consider his application for section 212(c) relief. The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge erred by holding that he is ineligible for section 212(c) relief because he was convicted pursuant to a jury trial, rather than pursuant to a guilty plea. Additionally, the respondent raises due process arguments. In his motion to remand, the respondent contends that his proceedings should be remanded to the Immigration Judge so that he can apply for relief under section 212(h) of the Act.
 
Turning first to the respondent’s application for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent is ineligible for section 212(c) relief (I. J. at 2). Specifically, we find that the respondent’s conviction by jury trial does not fall within the ambit of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001) (holding that the repeal of section 212(c) of the Act by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (“IIRIRA”) could not be applied retroactively to aliens who pled guilty or nolo contendere to a crime prior to IIRIRA’s enactment). See Alexandre v. United States Attorney General 452 F.3d 1204, 1207 (11th Cir. 2006) (finding that a section 212(c) waiver was precluded because the alien had proceeded to trial and was convicted by jury). To the extent that the respondent relies on the decisions in other federal courts of appeal that have found that section 212(c) relief may be available to aliens who were convicted after a jury trial, we find that those decisions are not binding on the present matter as they did not arise in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (the “Eleventh Circuit’), the jurisdiction in which this case arises. See Matter of Anselmo, 20 I&N Dec. 25, 31 (BIA 1989) (explaining that the Board historically follows a court’s precedent in cases arising in that circuit). Moreover, we reject the respondent’s contention on appeal that the Eleventh Circuit has only issued decisions containing non-binding dicta indicating that relief under former section 212(c) of the Act is unavailable to aliens who have been convicted pursuant to a jury trial. See Alexandre v. United States Attorney General, supra, at 1207. We also reject the respondent’s assertion on appeal that the law of the case doctrine forbad the Immigration Judge from pretermitting his application for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act. Although we remanded the record of proceedings to the Immigration Judge to consider the respondent’s application for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act in light of INS v. St. Cyr, supra, the respondent concedes on appeal that our remand was based on a conviction document that erroneously indicated that he had been convicted pursuant to a guilty plea. See respondent’s motion to remand at pg. 3, n.1. In this regard, we reject the respondent’s argument on appeal that it was incumbent upon the DHS to determine prior to our remand that the respondent had been convicted pursuant to a jury trial rather than pursuant to a guilty plea. Furthermore, to the extent that the respondent argues that the relevant law as applied to him is unconstitutional, we have no jurisdiction over the constitutionality of the statutes and regulations we administer. See Matter of C-, 20 I&N Dec. 529, 532 (BIA 1992).
 
*2 Turning next to the respondent’s motion to remand, we find that remand of proceedings is not warranted. With his motion to remand, the respondent has submitted an application for relief under section 212(h) of the Act, as well as supporting documentation. We find that the respondent has not adequately demonstrated that the proffered evidence with his motion to remand was not previously available or could not have been presented during his hearing before the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1002.3(c)(1), (c)(4); see generally Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547 (BIA 1992) (providing that an alien seeking reopening based on a failure to request relief before the completion of deportation proceedings must meet the general motion requirements). Moreover, we note that, even if the Immigration Judge failed to advise the respondent of his right to apply for relief under section 212(h) of the Act during the initial proceedings, as argued by the respondent in his motion, the respondent was nonetheless aware of the possibility for such relief during the remanded proceedings and still failed to apply at that time (Tr. at 16-17). To the extent that the respondent claims that his failure to request relief under section 212(h) of the Act before the Immigration Judge was the result of ineffective assistance by his counsel, he has made no attempt to comply with the procedural requirements set forth under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s May 10, 2007, decision denying her¿FN1º motion to rescind the order of removal entered in her case on an in absentia basis. We have considered the respondent’s appellate arguments as set forth on her Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26), her statement attached thereto, and in her subsequently-filed brief. Inasmuch as we agree with the Immigration Judge’s resolution of this case, we adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision, with the exception of the discussion found on pages 5 and 6 suggesting frivolous behavior on the part of the respondent’s current attorney. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994).
 
On appeal, the respondent’s current attorney asserts that the respondent’s supporting declaration sufficiently establishes that she did not receive notice of her March 5, 2007, hearing from her former attorney. See Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26); Respondent’s Brief on Appeal. We disagree. In that declaration, the respondent indicates only that upon her release from detention she provided her new address in New Jersey to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and to the Immigration Court. She makes no specific claims of having provided this address to her former attorney, Ronald Higgins,¿FN2º having kept in touch with attorney Higgins, or that attorney Higgins failed to apprise her that a hearing would be conducted in her case on March 5, 2007. See Exh. 8 (Motion, attached declaration).
 
There also is no indication that prior to the March 5th proceeding attorney Higgins was granted a withdrawal of his representation of the respondent, or that substitute counsel entered an appearance in his stead. Rather, the record reflects that attorney Higgins appeared at the hearing as scheduled, and that the Immigration Judge found he offered no reasonable cause accounting for the respondent’s absence. See Exh. 6 (March 5, 2007, I.J. dec); see also May 10, 2007, I.J. dec at 5.
 
Under the circumstances presented, the respondent was given proper notice of her March 5, 2007, hearing in accordance with the federal regulatory requirements. See I.J. at 5; 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (2007); see also Men Keng Chang v. Jiugni, 669 F.2d 275, 277(5th Cir. 1982); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985); Exh. 3 (Form EOIR-28, filed November 17, 2006, in Immigration Court by attorney Higgins) and Exh. 5 (hearing notice). In arguing otherwise, the respondent’s reliance on case law handed down by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is misplaced, inasmuch as the instant case arises in the Fifth, not the Ninth, Circuit.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent’s current attorney asserts that the respondent received ineffective assistance by her former attorney. However, none of the requirements for advancing such a claim, as discussed in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), have been satisfied. Citing Ninth Circuit case law, the respondent contends that compliance with the Lozada requirements are not necessary in this case. See Brief, pp. 4-5. However, as has already been noted Ninth Circuit case law is not controlling here. In any event, the Fifth Circuit has specifically held that to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien in removal proceedings must fulfillthe Lozada requirements and must demonstrate that counsel’s actions were prejudicial to his case. See Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006); Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir. 2000). No such showings have been made here.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

In his filings, current counsel inconsistently refers to the respondent in both the male and female gender. Compare Exh. 8 (Motion to Reopen (Motion) filed with the San Antonio Immigration Court April 23, 2007) with Respondent’s Brief on Appeal (Brief). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was female. See May 10, 2007, I.J. dec; see also Record of Deportable Alien (Form I-213). Accordingly, we rely on the Immigration Judge’s finding in this regard.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
A. Manuel Nieves, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 This natter was last before the Board on November 19, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s July 30, 2007, decision denying his motion to reopen and to rescind therein absentia order of deportation entered against him on October 15, 1992. The respondent has filed with the Board a second motion to reopen, alleging ineffective assistance by his former counsel. The motion will be denied for lack of jurisdiction.
 
The respondent contends on appeal that he did not attend his scheduled deportation hearing on October 15, 1992, due to the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. The respondent further argues that his former counsel’s deficient performance constitutes “reasonable cause” for his failure to appear under former section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
 
As initial matter we note, as we did in our November 19, 2007, decision, that the respondent’s case is governed by section 242B of the Act, not former section 242(b) of the Act, because the notice of hearing in this case was issued on July 16, 1992, after the June 13, 1992, effective date of section 242B of the Act See Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). Thus, under section 242B(c) of the Act, an in absentia order of deportation may only be rescinded upon a motion to reopen, filed before the Immigration Judge, within 180 days of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that his failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or at any time if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive proper notice of the hearing. See section 242B(c) of the Act; Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, supra. The Immigration Judge already has ruled on July 30, 2007, that the respondent had proper notice of his hearing because notice was properly mailed to his counsel of record, which we affirmed in our November 19, 2007, decision. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (notice to an alien’s counsel of record constitutes notice to the alien). If the respondent is seeking now to allege that his former attorney’s ineffective assistance constitutes exceptional circumstances to excuse his failure to appear, he was required to file a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge within 180 days of the in absentia order of deportation. See section 242B(c) of the Act; Matter of A-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998) (a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day time limit under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act); Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998).
 
*2 Accordingly, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Steven E. Comer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Piepmeier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on November 14, 2006, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order entered on January 17, 2006.
 
On December 26, 2007, the respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, filed a motion to reopen and rescind the January 17, 2006, in absentia removal order. The respondent’s motion is based, in part, on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by his two prior attorneys, Mr. David Paz Soldan and Mr. James F. Kajtoch.
 
We will reopen these proceedings on our own motion because we failed to consider the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims against his prior attorneys, Mr. Paz Soldan and Mr. Kajtoch, which he raised on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The respondent’s appeal brief, filed on September 25, 2006, detailed the allegations of his prior attorneys’ wrongdoing. When the respondent presented these claims on appeal, he proffered documentation that established his compliance with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 4-9, Exhibit 4. Yet, we did not consider these claims. See Board’s November 14, 2006, decision at 5.
 
The ineffective assistance of counsel claims raised by the respondent on appeal are the same as those he presents in the instant motion. He claims that on January 17, 2006, he arrived at 8:15 a.m. for his scheduled 8:30 A.M. removal hearing. When he did not find his attorney, Mr. Paz Soldan, he called the law office and was instructed to wait outside the courtroom until his attorney arrived. Mr. Paz Soldan did not arrive until 9:30 A.M. By the time they entered the courtroom together it was empty. When Mr. Paz Soldan failed to file a promised motion to reopen, the respondent retained Mr. Kajtoch.
 
According to the respondent’s August 31, 2006, statement, which was submitted on appeal, when Mr. Kajtoch assisted him in filing a motion to reopen he insisted that the respondent state that he understood that the hearing was scheduled for 9:30 A.M. and that he arrived at the courtroom at 9:15 A.M. The respondent claims that he did not want to tell a lie, but Mr. Kajtoch insisted that it was necessary to obtain reopening. Mr. Kajtoch also advised the respondent not to file a Lozada claim against Mr. Paz Soldan. The respondent also asserted that Mr. Kajtoch erred by failing to support the respondent’s motions to reopen with any applications for relief from removal. See Respondent’s Appeal Brief at 5-9, Attachment 4 at 2-3. Notably, there is no evidence to establish that Mr. Paz Soldan or Mr. Kajtoch ever responded to the respondent’s allegations.
 
*2 Had we adjudicated the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims which he raised on appeal, we would have remanded this case for further proceedings. The respondent followed the directives of both his prior attorneys, Mr. Paz Soldan and Mr. Kajtoch. Had the respondent not relied on his attorneys’ bad advice, he would have appeared for his hearing or obtained reopening. See Monjaraz-Munoz, 327 F.3d 892 (9th Cir. 2003)(if an alien fails to appear because of his actual and reasonable reliance on counsel’s erroneous advice, it can constitute an exceptional circumstance beyond the control of the alien). Based on the foregoing, we find it appropriate to reopen these proceedings on our own motion. Because we find it appropriate to reopen these proceedings, we will not address the remaining issues raised by the respondent in this instant motion.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sigang Li, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Certification
 
*1 On September 19, 2007, the respondent filed this appeal from an Immigration Judge’s July 2, 2007, decision. It is undisputed that the appeal, which was due on or before August 1, 2007, is untimely. With the Notice of Appeal, the respondent has submitted a motion in which he asserts that his former attorney’s mishandling of his case resulted in the untimeliness of the appeal. We will construe the respondent’s motion as a motion for certification to the Board. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (c). The motion will be denied and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
In his motion, the respondent merely asserts that “(h)is counsel reserved the appeal …(h)owever, such appeal was never filed.” He has not, however, provided evidence that he entered into an agreement with his former attorney to filed an appeal. See generally Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (specifying the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the context of motions filed before the Board). Although he has submitted a copy of a complaint against his former attorney to the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the respondent has not submitted proof that the complaint has been properly filed, and he has not submitted a statement of the alleged misrepresentations. The evidence submitted with the motion simply fails to show that ineffective assistance of counsel caused the untimeliness of the appeal. Accordingly, the motion for certification will be denied, and the untimely appeal will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, and 1240.15. The Immigration Judge’s decision is now final, and the record will be returned to the Immigration Court.¿FN1º See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.39 and 1240.14.
 
The following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion for certification to the Board is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The untimely appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

The respondent’s appeal has been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely must be filed with the Board. However, a motion challenging any other finding or seeking reopening of the proceedings must be filed with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). Strict time and number limits apply to motions to reconsider and motions to reopen before the Immigration Judge and this Board. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2) and 1003.23(b)(1).

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John R. Holya
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º -In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s March 22, 2007, decision denying her “Motion to Reconsider.” The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The procedural history of this case is as follows. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on June 29, 2004, because she failed to appear for a hearing. On March 31, 2006, she filed a motion to reopen alleging that she did not receive notice of the hearing, which was granted by the Immigration Judge on April 17, 2006. The respondent was given until January 24, 2007, to file an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). When the respondent failed to timely file her application for cancellation of removal, the Immigration Judge found that her application had been abandoned and granted her voluntary departure in a decision dated February 7, 2007. On February 26, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, which the Immigration Judge denied on March 6, 2007. The respondent then filed a “Motion to Reconsider,” which the Immigration Judge denied on March 22, 2007. The respondent now appeals from the Immigration Judge’s denial of her “Motion to Reconsider.” On appeal, the respondent seeks reopening of proceedings because she was the victim of ineffective assistance. Specifically, the respondent contends that she failed to timely file her application for cancellation of removal because her current counsel failed to inform her in writing of her filing deadline.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s “Motion to Reconsider.” To the extent that the respondent’s “Motion to Reconsider”challenged the merits of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying her motion to reopen, we find that she failed to establish any material error of fact or law in the Immigration Judge’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Specifically, we find that the Immigration Judge properly determined that the respondent failed to file a copy of her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act with her motion to reopen, as required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Because we find that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen for the above mentioned reason, we need not address the Immigration Judge’s additional finding that the respondent’s motion to reopen was number-barred. To the extent that the respondent sought to submit a copy of her application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act with her “Motion to Reconsider,” we construe her motion as a motion to reopen rather than as a motion to reconsider. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (providing that a motion to reopen is granted upon a proffer of new, material evidence); cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1) (providing that a motion to reconsider challenges determinations of law and fact). Since this was the respondent’s second motion to reopen filed after her in absentia removal order had been reopened, we find that it was number-barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
*2 Moreover, to the extent that the respondent seeks to submit new evidence on appeal in the form of a self-reporting letter to the Arizona State Bar from her current counsel alleging that he engaged in ineffective assistance, we are precluded from engaging in fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(iv) (providing that, subject to certain exceptions not applicable to the present case, the Board will not engage in fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals and that a party asserting that the Board cannot properly resolve an appeal without further fact-finding must file a motion to remand). Furthermore, we find that remand of proceedings based on this new evidence is not warranted. The letter does not concede that he and his assistants failed orally to provide the respondent with notice of the application deadline but merely contends that he should have done so in writing. Moreover, the respondent has not met the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered:
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $ 1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lidia Sanchez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Rescission
 
*1 ORDER: PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia in a December 4, 2006, Immigration Judge’s decision. She filed a motion to reopen proceedings on January 3, 2007, alleging that former counsel provided her with ineffective assistance as he misrepresented his handling of the case, and failed to inform her of her hearing date and time. In a February 14, 2007, decision an Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding the respondent had not complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent’s appeal of this decision is dismissed.
 
The Board has held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). Matter of Lozada requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639; see also Betouche v. Ashcroft, 357F.3d 147, 149 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing the above-noted requirements).
 
The Immigration Judge correctly found the respondent failed to comply with the requirements enumerated in Matter of Lozada, supra, as she did not show that she had notified former counsel of her claim, and filed a complaint against him with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. We find no merit to the respondent’s vague and generalized allegations that the Immigration Judge’s decision was “arbitrary and capricious,” an “abuse of discretion,” and “against the law” (Notice of Appeal).
 
*2 The respondent has not expounded on these ambiguous and unsupported assertions, and we find no support for the same.
 
On appeal the respondent submitted a letter which she reportedly filed with the bar authorities complaining about former counsel’s actions. However, we normally do not consider new evidence submitted on appeal as the record we review on appeal is the record before the Immigration Judge. Matter of H-A-, 20 I&N Dec. 529 (BIA 1992); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988); Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984) (the Board is an appellate body whose function is to review, not to create, a record.). Moreover, we do not find that a remand in this regard is warranted. There is no evidence that this letter was, in fact, filed with the authorities as alleged. Further, there is no evidence that the respondent’s former counsel has been informed of the allegations against him and afforded an opportunity to respond.¿FN1º See Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 9, 10-12 (1st Cir. 2004) (finding that counsel targeted by an ineffective assistance claim must “be provided an opportunity to respond before filing the motion to reopen”(emphasis added)). Therefore, as the respondent to date has yet to comply with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a remand in this regard is not appropriate. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2; see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992).
 
In sum, as the respondent has not established that she failed to appear at her hearing due to her former representative’s ineffective assistance, the Immigration Judge did not err in denying her motion to reopen. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

The circuit where this case arises has declined to find that the mere lodging of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with the bar authorities functionally satisfies the notice requirement. Betouche v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d at 151 (holding that the filing “simply established that ¿ the petitionerº had notified the Board of Bar Overseers of his complaint, not that either he or the Board had notified ¿prior counselº.”). Moreover, as noted, there is no objective evidence that such a claim has, in fact, been filed.

*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(A), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A)º - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
  
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s July 17, 2006, decision dismissing the respondent’s motion to terminate proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native of Lithuania who asserts that she is a citizen of the Ukraine, entered the United States as a visitor in April 2000 as a visitor, and adjusted her status to that of immigrant in November 2003, based upon the approval of a Petition for Alien Relative, filed by the respondent’s husband. After interviewing the respondent’s husband about the bona fides of the relationship, the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) initiated removal proceedings against the respondent, charging her with having engaged in marriage fraud.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is removable under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), because she procured her adjustment of status by marriage fraud under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act. (I.J. at 3-4, 16-17). Section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act states: “Any alien who, by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact, seeks to procure (or has sought to procure or has procured) a visa, other documentation, or entry into the United States or other benefit provided under this Act is excludable.”
 
The central question in determining the good faith of a marriage is whether the bride and groom intended to establish a life together at the time they were married. See, e.g., Matter of Soriano, 19 I&N Dec. 764, 765 (BIA 1988); Matter of Laureano, 19 I&N Dec. 1, 2-3 (BIA 1983). Evidence of such intent may include, but is not limited to, proof that the spouse has been listed on insurance policies, proof of joint property leases, income tax forms, bank accounts, a period of courtship, testimony of mutual experiences and a shared life, and the like. It also may include documentation relating to the degree to which the financial assets and liabilities of the parties were combined; documentation concerning the length of time during which the parties cohabited after the marriage and after the alien obtained permanent residence; and any other evidence supporting the bona fides of the marriage. See Matter of Laureano, supra; Matter of Phillis, 15 I&N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1216.4(a)(5) and 1216.5 (e)(2).
 
*2 In the present case, the respondent’s husband (a United States citizen petitioner) signed a statement in August 2004 in which he indicated that his marriage with the respondent was not consummated, and that he just wanted to help her become an American citizen (Exh. 2). He also described how the respondent’s daughter and son-in-law paid him, and helped arrange the marriage (Exh. 2). The petitioner now testifies that he signed under duress, and that his statement should not be considered (Tr. at 53, 73-74). We agree with the Immigration Judge that more weight should be given to the testimony of the special agents who interviewed the petitioner than to the testimony of the petitioner (I.J. at 10, 15), and that the petitioner’s statement should be considered.
 
The respondent has argued that in a number of instances, the testimony of the special agents was irrelevant, speculative, lacked foundation, and called for conclusions of law and/or opinions, and that because it was admitted into evidence, it rendered the proceedings unfair and was in violation of the due process clause of the Constitution (R brief at 6-9). We point out that in administrative removal proceedings, the Federal Rules of Evidence are not controlling. See Matter of Grijalva, 19 I&N Dec. 713 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). Rather, under the applicable federal regulations, the Immigration Judge may receive into evidence any oral or written statement which is material and relevant to any issue in the case previously made by the alien or any other person during any investigation or examination. See 8 C.F.R. § 1236.1 (2005); see generally 8 C.F.R. § 1242.14. The testimony of the special agents was certainly probative as to the circumstances surrounding the petitioner’s signing his statement. Likewise, the witness testimony permitted by the Immigration Judge was subject to cross examination by the respondent pursuant to section 240(b)(4)(B), and we thus find the reliance on such testimony by the Immigration Judge to be fundamentally fair. Furthermore, the Immigration Judge did not state that he was assigning more weight to the testimony of the special agents because of the disputed testimony that the respondent referred to.
 
Regarding the disputed testimony, the respondent argues that her first counsel of record should have cross-examined the special agents, and that her failure to do so constituted ineffective assistance of counsel (R brief at 8-9). The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge unreasonably held that the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) could not be deviated from (Tr. at 231-34). We note that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be supported by: 1) an affidavit by the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; 2) a showing that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and 3) a showing that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, or if not, why not. See id. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not complied with the first requirement of Lozada, i.e., submitting an affidavit detailing the agreement that she had with her first attorney (Tr. at 231-34). Although several circuits have held that aliens only need to show substantial compliance with Lozada, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (the “Seventh Circuit”), under whose jurisdiction the current case arises, is not one of those circuits. See Patel v. Gonzales, 496 F. 3d 829, 831 (7th Cir. 2007) (Court notes that while several Circuits have held that aliens only need to show substantial compliance with the requirements of Lozada, the Seventh Circuit has not expressly decided whether the Board abuses its discretion by requiring strict compliance with Lozada).
 
*3 Furthermore, even if is conceded that the requirements of Lozada were substantially complied with, the actions of counsel that are in question, i.e., allowing the aforementioned testimony of special agents to be admitted into evidence, allowing said agents to testify from memory without reference to their I-213 report, and not using said report as a cross-examination device, do not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel. Even if it is assumed that counsel should have performed all or some of the aforementioned actions, these actions (or inactions) strike us as tactical decisions, and it is not considered ineffective assistance for counsel to make tactical decisions that are not successful and operate to the client’s detriment. See Away v. Ashcroft, 328 F.3d 336, 343 (7th Cir. 2003) (hindsight applied to unwise tactical decision, to withdrawal of application for asylum, does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
The respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge violated her due process rights by denying her “Motion for Issuance of Subpoenas for Officers’ Materials & to Recall Officers as Witnesses” and a renewed “Motion for Issuance of Subpoenas for Officers’ Materials & to Recall Officers as Witnesses” (R brief at 9-10). In particular, she argues that the Immigration Judge should not have denied these motions summarily, and that the Immigration Judge should have reviewed the officer’s materials “in camera.” We point out that the Immigration Judge did not deny the aforementioned motions summarily (Tr. at 234-39). Rather, he denied them because the respondent did not contact the special agents to see if they would attend the hearing pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1287.4(a)(2)(ii)(B) (Tr. at 235). Furthermore, the respondent’s first attorney testified that after filing a FOIA request, she had been given a compact disc from the Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement which contained a reprint of the respondent’s file, albeit with much redaction and no notes from investigators (Tr. at 237-38). If the respondent wished to see if there was more information than was presented to her first attorney, she had a duty to try to obtain that information pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1287.4(a)(2)(ii)(B) before asking the Immigration Judge to issue a subpoena.
 
The respondent next argues that the Government did not meet its burden by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent committed marriage fraud under § 212(a)(6)(C)(I) (R at 10-13). However, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the Government did meet said burden (I.J. at 4). The Immigration Judge specifically found that the testimony of the special agents who interviewed the petitioner should be fully credited over the equivocal testimony of the petitioner and his roommate (I.J. at 10). The Immigration Judge gave reasons for his conclusion, and found that contrary to the testimony of the petitioner and his roommate, the special agents testified clearly and convincingly (I.J. at 15). These factual determinations are not “clearly erroneous.” See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(i)(2005) (requiring this Board to review factual determinations of an Immigration Judge for clear error); Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, North Carolina, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985) (emphasizing the great deference accorded to findings regarding the credibility of witnesses under the “clearly erroneous” standard of review).
 
*4 The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge should not have given more weight to the agents than to the petitioner regarding whether the petitioner signed his statement on August 6, 2004, under duress by the special agents (R brief at 10-11). We find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to accord greater weight to the special agent’s testimony than to the petitioner and his roommate (I.J. at 10, 15). There was no indication that the special agents’ testimony was in any way unreliable regarding whether the petitioner signed his statement under duress. Although the petitioner testified that the special agents told him that they would take him to jail if he didn’t talk and that he felt forced to give testimony (Tr. at 53, 73-74), one of the special agents testified that the interview was not uncomfortable, and that he wanted to impress upon the petitioner that he wasn’t being hostile (Tr. at 114-15). Furthermore, both special agents did not testify that they told the petitioner he would go to jail if he did not talk, but testified that they informed him of the consequences of marriage fraud and perjury(Tr. at 134, 164). We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the petitioner has not shown that he did not understand what he was signing in August 2004 (I.J. at 14-15). Although a physician expresses concern about the petitioner’s ability to internalize stress in a letter dated April 2006, (Exh. 3-2), the letter does not call into question the petitioner’s ability to understand what he was signing in August 2004 (I.J. at 14). The petitioner submitted an affidavit dated April 2006 (Exh. 3-1), in which he did not deny that his signature and initials appeared on the August 2004 statement, but that he was under great emotional and physical stress, and did not know what he was signing. However, we point out that one of the questions asked on the respondent’s statement (Exh. 2) was whether he understood he was giving a sworn statement and whether he swore that his statements were the truth.
 
The respondent also argues that the special agents testified strictly from memory without referring to their I-213, and that they did not enter the I-213 into evidence (R brief at 12-13). While this is true, it does not strike us as meaningful. Although the respondent argues that the government usually enters the I-213s into evidence (R brief at 12), the respondent has not provided any proof that this is true. The respondent has attempted to describe the agents’ testimony as riddled with so many inconsistencies (R brief at 11-13) that it cannot be believed regarding the crucial question as to whether her husband signed his statement under duress. However, the inconsistencies that the respondent points to (the time that the agents arrived at the apartment, the school that the petitioner’s roommate attended, and whether or not the petitioner and his roommate jointly bought the apartment that they shared together), even if true, are not material. They certainly do not render the agents’ testimony less credible regarding the petitioner’s statement (Exh. 2), and in particular, whether or not there was any duress in his signing it.
 
*5 As to the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge ignored as a matter of law that parties need not necessarily live together to be considered legitimately married (R brief at 13), this is not true. While the Immigration Judge pointed out that the petitioner and the respondent did not live together (I.J. at 19), this was not the main reason for the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent had engaged in marriage fraud. Furthermore, 8 C.F.R. § 1216.5(e)(2) specifically lists “documentation concerning the length of time during which the parties cohabited after the marriage and after the alien obtained permanent residence” as an element to consider when considering whether an alien entered into a qualifying marriage in good faith.
 
In conclusion, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision dismissing the respondent’s motion to terminate proceedings, and finding the respondent removable for procuring her admission to the United States through adjustment of status by marriage fraud under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL and MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
George P. Mann, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rosario S. Shoudy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice; Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Asylum, withholding of removal, Convention Against Torture; reopening
 
This case is presently before us on the respondent’s timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s November 2, 2006, order denying his motion to reopen an in absentia order of removal that was entered on August 2, 2006. Along with his appeal brief, the respondent moved to reopen this matter based upon changed country conditions and also based on a then-pending visa petition, filed by his United States citizen wife after their July 2003 marriage. The visa petition has since been approved, and a visa is immediately available to the respondent. See August 13, 2007, Supplement to Motion to Reopen.¿FN1º However, because the motion to reopen to pursue adjustment of status was not filed within 90 days of the entry of the original in absentia order of removal, it is untimely and will be denied.
 
In his brief in support of his appeal of the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen the in absentia order of removal, the respondent argues that reopening is appropriate because ineffective assistance of prior counsel caused him to miss his scheduled hearing on August 2, 2006. Although, as the Immigration Judge indicated, the respondent was present when a hearing notice was provided to his prior counsel, he does not speak English and attests that he was never given a copy of the notice. See Immigration Judge’s November 2, 2006, Order; Respondent’s January 11, 2007, Brief at Exh. 3. Indeed, there appears to be some question about how (or if) the respondent was notified of the August 2, 2006, hearing, in that the Department of Homeland Security (“the DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) indicated below that an evidentiary hearing should be held to determine if the former attorney had, as he claimed, “called the respondent” to notify him of the August 2, 2006, hearing. See DHS’s September 18, 2006, Answer to Motion to Reopen. The respondent’s wife provided an affidavit in support of the motion to reopen below that states that the couple was unaware of the date of the August 2, 2006, hearing and that she repeatedly called the attorney’s office to find out the hearing date but was never told about it. See Respondent’s September 14, 2006, Motion to Reopen. She supports this affidavit with telephone records that purportedly indicate telephone calls to former counsel. Id. Additionally, the respondent’s wife indicated in the same affidavit that the couple did not receive notice of a prior rescheduled hearing from former counsel, and instead only learned of the new hearing date by calling the Immigration Court. Id.
 
*2 Because the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for setting forth ineffective assistance of counsel claims, has set forth facts that, if found by the Immigration Judge, would tend to indicate ineffective assistance of counsel, and has shown prejudice from that ineffective assistance in the form of his apparent eligibility for adjustment of status, we will sustain the respondent’s appeal. Further fact- finding is necessary to determine if the respondent has set forth an actionable claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. Because we will sustain the appeal and remand this record, we need not address the respondent’s arguments regarding changed country conditions in Lebanon.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen to pursue adjustment of status is denied.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained and the Immigration Judge’s November 2, 2006, order denying the respondent’s motion to reopen is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order.
 
Board Member Patricia A. Cole concurs with the majority’s decision to deny respondent’s motion to reopen to pursue adjustment of status. However, the evidence of record does not support a conclusion that the respondent did not receive proper notice to appear at his removal hearing. I would not grant the respondent’s motion to reopen the in absentia order of removal and dissent from this portion of the majority’s decision.

The motion to reopen, which has since been supplemented and updated, is supported by evidence of the bona fides of the marriage, including the fact that as of the last filing in this matter, the couple was expecting the birth of their first child.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS MOTION
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Pro Se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 On October 19, 2007, the respondents¿FN1º timely filed a motion to reconsider our September 27, 2007, decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The respondents contend that we erred in finding them removable on the charge under section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B), for remaining in the United States longer than permitted. The motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider shall specify the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1). We have reviewed the contentions raised in the respondents’ motion, but find that our previous decision was correct. On motion, the respondents raise various arguments, including their eligibility for adjustment of status as “arriving aliens” pursuant to 71 Fed. Reg. 27585 (2006), deficiencies in the Immigration Judge’s decision, as well as their attorneys’ ineffective assistance of counsel. These are all arguments which we either considered at the time of our prior decision in September 2007, or that could have been argued in the context of the direct appeal. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 58 (BIA 2006) (indicating that “¿aº motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied.”)
 
In our September 2007 decision, we agreed with the Immigration Judge that the respondents had not submitted any evidence to show that they extended or changed their status in a timely manner, prior to expiration of their nonimmigrant visas on June 30, 2005. We pointed out that a November 14, 2005, I-797C (Notice of Action) stated that the fee for the Form I-129 application (petition for a nonimmigrant worker) had been received, and that the filing date had been adjusted to reflect a “received date” of July 27, 2005. The respondents have now submitted a copy of a I-797C dated July 5, 2005, showing that the male respondent’s petition for a nonimmigrant worker was received on June 27, 2005. We point out that this new evidence would not show an error of fact or law in our prior decision based on the previous factual record. See id at 57. Furthermore, we point out that the later I-797C, i.e., the one dated November 14, 2005, shows that the male respondent’s petition was actually received on July 27, 2005. Both of these I-797Cs have the same receipt number, and the one dated November 14, 2005, states that the filing date was adjusted to July 27, 2005, to reflect receipt of payment. Inasmuch as the November 14, 2005, I-797C shows an adjusted filing date of July 27, 2005 (after the visa expiration date of June 30, 2005), we find that the submission of the I-797C showing “receipt” of petition on June 27, 2005, is not enough for us to reconsider our decision. There was not an error of fact in the September 2007 decision.
 
*2 The respondents also submitted a copy of a I-797C, dated August 21, 2006, showing that a Form I-526 application (immigrant petition by alien entrepreneur) was received on August 14, 2006. We note that this was information that the respondents could have provided at the time of the September 2007 decision. Moreover, even if this information had been submitted prior to said decision, the visa petition would not have been filed prior to the expiration of the respondents’ nonimmigrant visas on June 30, 2005. Again, there was not an error of fact in the September 2007 decision.
 
In conclusion, we cannot find based upon the record which was before us when we last considered these proceedings that an error of fact or law exists in the September 2007 decision. Accordingly, we decline to reconsider our decision, and the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas Rosenthal, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Moira Arsenault
Appellate Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
  
APPLICATION: Termination of removal proceedings
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s July 31, 2007, decision ordering him removed from the United States to Jamaica as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and a controlled substance violation, and moves for a remand to the Immigration Judge, a stay of removal, and termination of proceedings. The motions will be denied and the appeal will be dismissed.
  
I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Jamaica. On or about July 11, 1985, the respondent was admitted to the United States in New York, New York, as a lawful permanent resident. On October 3, 2006, the respondent pled guilty and was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance (cocaine) with intent to sell in violation of New York Penal Law § 220.16(1). On January 31, 2007, the respondent was charged as deportable pursuant to sections 237(a)(2)(B)(i) and 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. After being placed in removal proceedings, the respondent moved the New York State court to vacate his conviction (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge issued his oral decision on July 31, 2007, ordering the respondent removed and noting that the respondent’s motion in state court was merely a collateral attack (I.J. at 2-3). The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent was not eligible for cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, asylum, or withholding of removal because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony (I.J. at 2). The respondent did not request deferral of removal pursuant to the Convention Against Torture (I.J. at 2). The respondent then moved the State court to accept a delayed appeal pursuant to section 460.30 of the New York Criminal Procedure Law, apparently based on a claim that his waiver of appeal rights was due to ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Brief Exh.; Respondent’s Motion Exh.). On August 6, 2007, the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision. On August 23, 2007, the respondent filed with the Board a motion to remand proceedings and requested a stay of removal, arguing that his conviction was not final by nature of his request for a delayed appeal. On September 14, 2007, the state appellate court granted the respondent’s motion for a late appeal, causing the respondent’s conviction now to be pending on direct appeal as of right (Respondent’s Brief Exh.; Respondent’s Motion Exh.). See N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law § 460.30. Consequently, on September 18, 2007, the respondent filed with the Board a motion to terminate proceedings because of the alleged lack of finality of his predicate conviction, and filed an appeal brief containing the same argument. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) did not respond to the motion or file a responsive brief on appeal, but at our request, both parties presented oral argument on December 6, 2007. At oral argument, DHS argued that a conviction on direct appeal is a valid factual predicate for a charge of deportability and, in the alternative, that the respondent’s appeal should be deemed a collateral attack.¿FN1º
  
II. ISSUE
 
*2 The issue on appeal is whether the definition of the term “conviction” in section 101 (a)(48)(A) of the Act, enacted as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”), in pertinent part defined as “a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court,” supersedes prior Board and judicial interpretations that a “conviction” under the Act requires waiver or exhaustion of direct appeal rights to serve as a valid factual predicate for a charge of deportability.
  
III. BACKGROUND
 
Until the 1996 enactment of IIRIRA no definition of the term “conviction” existed in the immigration laws. For several decades, the United States Courts of Appeals and the Board had determined that a criminal judgment against an alien did not qualify as a “conviction” for immigration purposes unless the judgment was “final” in the sense that the alien’s right to direct appellate review had been exhausted or waived. See, e.g., White v. INS, 17 F.3d 475,479 (1st Cir. 1994); Martinez-Montoya v. INS, 904 F.2d 1018, 1025 (5th Cir. 1990); Morales-Alvarado v. INS, 655 F.2d 172, 175 (9th Cir. 1981); Marino v. INS, 537 F.2d 686, 691-92 (2d Cir. 1976); Aguilera-Enriquez v. INS, 516 F.2d 565, 570 (6th Cir. 1975); Will v. INS, 447 F.2d 529, 532-33 (7th Cir. 1971); Matter of Thomas, 21 I&N Dec. 20, 21 n.1 (BIA 1995); Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894, 895-96 (BIA 1994); Matter of Ozkok, 19 I&N Dec. 546, 551-52 n.7 (BIA 1988). The origin of this “finality” requirement is unclear¿FN2º and may have derived, at least in part, from a terse 1955 opinion of the United States Supreme Court in which it held, in its entirety, that: “On the record here we are unable to say that the conviction has attained such finality as to support an Order of deportation within the contemplation of § 241 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.A. § 1251. The judgment is reversed.” Pino v. Landon, 349 U.S. 901 (1955) (per curiam), rev’g Pino v. Nicolls, 215 F.2d 237 (1st Cir. 1954) (holding that an alien was convicted under the Act under a Massachusetts procedure permitting the alien’s sentence to be revoked and the case placed “on file” after a previous finding of guilt). The issue before us in this case is whether this judicially-created requirement of “finality” through exhaustion or waiver of direct appeal rights survives the 1996 enactment of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, which set forth, for the first time in the Act, the precise meaning of a “conviction” for immigration purposes. For the following reasons, we conclude that the respondent’s conviction remains a valid predicate for the charge of deportability because a “conviction,”as defined in the Act, does not require the exhaustion or waiver of direct appeal rights.
  
DISCUSSION
 
*3 To determine whether the respondent has been “convicted,” the touchstone of our analysis is the plain language of the Act. Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U.S. 526, 534 (2004) (citing Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson, 525 U.S. 432, 438 (1999)). It is presumed that Congress “says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.” Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N.A., 530 U.S. 1, 6 (2000) (quoting Connecticut Nat’l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 254 (1992)); see also Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1994). We are mindful that the words of a statute cannot meaningfully be understood in isolation; “¿tºhe meaning-or ambiguity-of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.” Zuni Public Schools Dist. No. 89 v. Dep’t of Educ., 127 S.Ct. 1534, 1545-46 (2007) (citing and quoting FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 132-33 (2000), and Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 118 (1994) ( “¿a ºmbiguity is a creature not ¿justº of definitional possibilities but ¿alsoº of statutory context.”)). However, once the unambiguous meaning of the statutory language has been determined, it must be given effect except in those rare circumstances where strict adherence to the text would lead to an absurd or “bizarre” result that is “‘demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.”’ Demarest v. Manspeaker, 498 U.S. 184, 190-91 (1991) (quoting Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U.S. 564, 571 (1982)).¿FN3º
 
For purposes of the Act, Congress has defined the term “conviction” as follows:
§ 1101. Definitions
(a) As used in this Act—
 
....
 
(48)(A) The term ‘conviction’ means, with respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or, if adjudication of guilt has been withheld, where—
(i) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt, and
 
(ii) the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien’s liberty to be imposed
 
 
 
Section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A) (codified pursuant to section 322(a)(1) of IIRIRA, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-628 (effective April 1, 1997)). Thus, under current law a “conviction” exists for immigration purposes if either: (1) “a formal judgment of guilt of the alien ¿has beenº entered by a court;” or (2) a judicial finding of guilt has been “withheld,” but the alien’s guilt has nonetheless been established by other means, resulting in the imposition of a penal sanction, “or restraint on the alien’s liberty.” Id.
 
*4 Section 101(a)(48)(A) does not state that a conviction must be made “final” by exhaustion or waiver of appeal rights, nor does the term “conviction” implicitly denote the existence of such a requirement. As the Supreme Court explained in Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129 (1993), “the word ‘conviction’ can mean either the finding of guilt or the entry of a final judgment on that finding,” among other things. Id. at 131. In Deal, for purposes of the recidivist enhancement provision codified at 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1), the Court held that “conviction” meant the former. Id. at 132-35. We will not read an exhaustion or waiver requirement into section 101(a)(48)(A) absent a basis for such a reading in the plain language of the statute. See Braswell v. United States, 224 F.2d 706, 710 (10th Cir. 1955) (refusing to infer a “finality” requirement for predicate convictions under former section 2(e) of the Federal Firearms Act where the statutory language contained no such requirement). Indeed, the silence of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act with regard to any finality requirement has persuaded those United States Courts of Appeals that have analyzed the issue that the finality requirement has been superseded. See United States v. Saenz-Gomez, 472 F.3d 791,794 (10th Cir. 2007) (holding that the literal language of section 101(a)(48)(A) was controlling as to the meaning of “conviction,” and declining to infer the continued existence of the finality requirement where the plain language of the statute was clear and did not lead to an irrational result);¿FN4º Montenegro v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 1035, 1037 (7th Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (holding that “IIRIRA eliminated the finality requirement for a conviction”); Moosa v. INS, 171 F.3d 994, 1009 (5th Cir. 1999) (dicta that “¿tºhere is no indication that the finality requirement imposed … prior to 1996¿º survives the new definition of ‘conviction’ found in IIRIRA § 322(a)”); Puello v. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Servs., 511 F.3d 324, 2007 WL 4440916, at *8 (2d Cir. 2007) (dicta that “IIRIRA … eliminate¿dº the requirement that all direct appeals be exhausted or waived before a conviction is considered final”); see also Griffiths v. INS, 243 F.3d 45, 50 (1st Cir. 2001) (reserving the question but citing Moosa with approval). But see United States v. Garcia-Echaverria, 374 F.3d 440, 445 (6th Cir. 2004) (adopting in dicta, without analysis, pre-IIRIRA law requiring the finality of convictions).
 
*5 Although Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that preexisting interpretation when it reenacts a statute without change, Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978), we deem the presumption to have been rebutted in the present context because IIRIRA embodied an unequivocal break with the prior judicial and administrative requirement of finality of convictions in immigration proceedings in that it included, for the first time, a statutory definition of “conviction” under the Act. Section 101 (a)(48)(A) defines two types of convictions, those arising from “a formal judgment of guilt,” and those in which the “adjudication of guilt has been withheld.” With respect to the latter, deferred adjudication, Congress adopted almost verbatim two prongs of the test enumerated in Matter of Ozkok, supra, at 551, but notably omitted the third prong of that test, which considered a deferred judgment to be a conviction only when “a judgment or adjudication of guilt may be entered if the person violates the terms of his probation or fails to comply with the requirements of the court’s order, without availability of further proceedings regarding the person’s guilt or innocence of the original charge.” See Matter of Ozkok, supra, at 552. Notably, the third prong in Matter of Ozkok, supra, was supported in a footnote by a reference to the finality rule at issue here. Id. at 552 n.7. However, the language used in IIRIRA to define a conviction arising from “a formal judgment of guilt” does not enjoy a similar pedigree. Therefore, we will ascribe no specific intent to Congress with regard to the issue presented, beyond Congress’s intent to enact into law the definition of a conviction arising from “a formal judgment of guilt” now contained in section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act.
 
DHS contends that the legislative history of section 101(a)(48)(A) also lends support to the conclusion that exhaustion or waiver of appeal rights is not required to constitute a conviction under the Act. We disagree, and decline to rely on legislative history absent ambiguity in the plain language of the statute. The Congressional conference report explains the nature and purpose of section 101(a)(48)(A) as bringing more adjudicative processes within the definition of “conviction” and states that section 101(a)(48)(A) “deliberately broadens the scope of the definition of ‘conviction’ beyond that adopted by the Board of Immigration Appeals in Matter of Ozkok, 19 I&N Dec. 546 (BIA 1988).” H.R. Rep. No. 104-828, at 224 (1996). See Matter of Punu, 22 I&N Dec. 224, 227 (BIA 1998) (discussing the legislative history underlying the definition of “conviction”). The conference report also states that “¿tºhis new provision, by removing the third prong of Ozkok, clarifies Congressional intent that even in cases where adjudication is ‘deferred,’ the original finding or confession of guilt is sufficient to establish a ‘conviction’ for purposes of the immigration laws.” Id. (emphasis added). DHS argues that this latter statement suggests, by using the language “even in,” that likewise in cases other than those where adjudication of guilt is deferred, Congress intended a “formal judgment of guilt” to constitute an “original finding or confession of guilt … sufficient to establish a ‘conviction.”’ Nonetheless, we are unable to find that this single, opaque and unexplained statement constitutes an expression of Congressional intent to dismantle the finality doctrine.¿FN5º
 
*6 DHS also contends that Congress’s inclusion of a requirement for finality of convictions or judgments in certain other provisions of the Act provides support for DHS’s interpretation of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act. See Clay v. United States, 537 U.S. 522, 528-29 (2003) (reiterating the maxim that “¿wºhen Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act … it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion”) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). However, we have examined these provisions and observe that their unique historical and statutory contexts make comparisons inapt and too far removed to provide meaningful direction.¿FN6º Thus, we find that these provisions provide no clear guidance regarding the proper construction of the term “conviction” enacted in IIRIRA. Instead, we rely on the plain language of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act, reinforced by the decisions of the courts of appeals that have reached this issue, to conclude that “finality,” in the sense of the necessity for waiver or exhaustion of a direct appeal, was eliminated by IIRIRA and is no longer required.¿FN7º
  
IV. CONCLUSION
 
We acknowledge that, even after the 1996 enactment of the controlling definition of “conviction,” many of our unpublished orders have repeated the pre-IIRIRA rule requiring that a conviction has attained “finality.” In part, such statements to date have reflected the practice of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, continued under its successor agency DHS, of even after IIRIRA instituting proceedings only after an alien’s direct appeal rights were exhausted, with rare exceptions. At oral argument, DHS counsel indicated that this was, and is, done for prudential reasons. We point out that nothing in this opinion precludes DHS from continuing its policy of exercising prosecutorial discretion by charging the vast majority of convicted aliens only after their criminal convictions have attained a certain degree of finality. DHS has exclusive authority over when to bring charges. We hold only that, for the foregoing reasons, prior judicial and administrative interpretations that required a conviction under the Act to be “final” through exhaustion or waiver of direct appeal rights were superseded when IIRIRA expressly defined a “conviction” under the Act in section 101(a)(48)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A). Therefore, we conclude that the respondent’s conviction, pending on direct appeal, is a valid predicate for the charge of deportability.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motions are denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We reject DHS’s alternative argument because the respondent’s case is pending on direct appeal under New York law and DHS has not demonstrated any basis in law or fact for us to conclude otherwise. See N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law § 460.30. We note that a collateral attack is one that follows the exhaustion of direct appeal rights. Here, the New York procedure is one that has restored the respondent’s direct appeal. DHS has made no showing that the grounds available to the respondent are limited to those grounds available only on collateral attack or are narrower than those available to defendants filing a timely direct appeal in the first instance. We note also that other States provide a similar procedure allowing a criminal appeal to be filed in certain circumstances after the initial time to appeal has expired. See, e.g., Ill. S. Ct. Rule 606(c); Commonwealth v. Trussell, 862 N.E.2d 444 (Mass App. Ct. 2007); Jones v. State, 940 S.W.2d 887 (Sup. Ct. Ark. 1997); Bryant v. State, 527 S.W.2d 742 (Sup. Ct. Tenn. 1975); cf also Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(4).

See Matter of O, 7 I&N Dec. 539, 551 (BIA 1957)(“Such a rule was said to have existed prior to the act”).

3

There is nothing absurd about treating the text of section 101 (a)(48)(A) as negating a requirement that a direct appeal be pending, nor does the respondent so contend. Compare Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003), where we noted that one court of appeals found the text of section 101(a)(43)(A) so clear as to compel a finding that even a conviction reversed on the merits remained a “conviction” for immigration purposes. However, we declined to adopt this interpretation, deeming it to lead to bizarre or absurd consequences not in keeping with the intent of Congress. Id. at 624n.2. See also Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, 61n.2 (1980) (rejecting the “extreme” argument that a reversed conviction remained a conviction for purposes of the statute punishing possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, but noting that the statute would apply where, as here, possession occurred while a conviction was pending on appeal).

4

Saenz-Gomez involved the penalty provisions of section 276(b) and found that an alien who was removed nine days following his conviction on drug trafficking charges had been removed “subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.”

5

In Matter of Punu, supra, we addressed the deferred adjudication part of the newly-enacted definition of “conviction,” holding that an alien had been convicted for immigration purposes where he was subject to a Texas procedure that permitted a trial court to defer an adjudication of his criminal charge upon the entry of a guilty plea and to place him on rehabilitative probation with an eye to the eventual dismissal of the charges. The alien in Matter of Punu, supra at 227-28, argued that such a deferred adjudication was not a conviction for immigration purposes because, among other things, Texas law allowed for the possibility of further appellate review on the question of guilt or innocence in the event that he violated probation. However, we held that the possibility of such further review was “not determinative” in view of the plain language of section 101(a)(48)(A) and its legislative history, which reflected an unequivocal legislative intent to treat such deferred adjudications as convictions. However, in Matter of Punu, supra, we had no occasion to decide the question at issue here: whether a “formal judgment of guilt entered by a court” under the first part of the statutory definition of “conviction” qualifies as a valid factual predicate for a charge of deportability where the alien has not waived or exhausted his direct appeal rights. See id. at 234 n.1 (Grant, concurring).

6

For example, section 237(a)(2)(D) of the Act was first enacted in similar form in the Act of May 10, 1920, 41 Stat. 593, a year after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles following World War I. Moreover, language relied on by DHS regarding particularly serious crimes was originally enacted in the Refugee Act of 1980, 94 Stat. 102, and mirrors Article 33 of the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, 19 U.S.T. 6259, incorporated by reference in the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, 19 U.S.T. 6223. Two other provisions of the Act might be construed either as neutral, or as affirming the general principle of the finality of convictions, in the respondent’s favor. Section 238(c)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1228(c)(3)(A)(iii), first enacted in the Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections Act of 1994, concerns the special case of a Federal district court judge issuing a criminal sentence and an order of deportation in the same proceeding; and section 241(a)(4)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(4)(B), enacted as section 242(h) of the Act in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, provides for removal of certain nonviolent offenders serving prison sentences.

7

We also take note again of Lewis v. United States, supra note 2, where, as previously observed, the Court found that the federal crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm could be committed even where a felony conviction is pending on direct appeal. Lewis thus rebuts any potential argument that DHS must prove the absence of a pending appeal to satisfy its burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence (a lesser standard than that applicable for criminal liability) that the respondent has been convicted as charged.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Saher Joseph Macarius, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s November 8, 2006, decision denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings. The motion was denied as untimely. On appeal, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance from his former counsel, and that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Lebanon who entered the United States on April 17, 2002, as a nonimmigrant visitor for business with authorization to remain in this country for a temporary period not to exceed June 16, 2002. He remained in the United States beyond this date without authorization, and was served with a Notice to Appear on January 9, 2003. The respondent appeared pro se at a hearing before an Immigration Judge on November 12, 2003, and explained that he married a United States citizen on June 2, 2003, and that a Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) was filed on his behalf. The Immigration Judge advised the respondent to submit evidence in support of his claim. The respondent subsequently retained counsel, who appeared on his behalf at a March 24, 2004, hearing. At that time, the respondent requested a continuance to await the approval of the Form I-130, and, in the alternative, sought voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge denied the request for a continuance because the respondent had failed to present evidence that a Form I-130 had been filed on his behalf, and denied voluntary departure in the exercise of discretion. The respondent filed a motion to reconsider on May 6, 2004, which was denied as untimely. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
In an August 22, 2006, motion to reopen, the respondent argued that his removal proceedings should be reopened because his former attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. In particular, he alleged that his prior counsel failed to file documents requested by the Immigration Judge, discouraged him from appealing the Immigration Judge’s decision, failed to timely file his motion to reconsider, and did not advise him of his right to file a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent’s motion to reopen was untimely. A motion to reopen before an Immigration Judge must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order of removal. See 8 C.F.R, § 1003.23(b). See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). In the instant case, the respondent’s motion would have been due on or before June 24, 2004. As noted above, the respondent did not file his motion to reopen until August 22, 2006.
 
*2 For an alien raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the untimeliness of the motion may possibly be excused under the doctrine of equitable tolling if the alien establishes that he exercised due diligence. See Cai Xing Chen v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 151, 154 n. 3 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting the issue remains unresolved). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not exercised due diligence in this case. The respondent was aware of the evidence the Immigration Judge requested from him in November 2003, and that his former attorney failed to submit this evidence in support of his claim. He knew that the Immigration Judge denied his request for a continuance on March 24, 2004, and that his prior counsel did not appeal this decision. In addition, the respondent knew that the Immigration Judge denied his untimely motion to reconsider on May 6, 2004. Consequently, the conduct of his prior attorney has been known by him since mid-2004. Yet the respondent did not file the motion until nearly 2 1/2 years after the Immigration Judge’s decision. We find that these facts do not support a finding that the respondent has acted with due diligence.
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that he did not know that his former counsel was ineffective until he obtained the services of his present attorney. This argument fails. While the respondent may not have characterized his former counsel’s actions as “ineffective” as that term is used by legal practitioners in immigration proceedings, he was well aware of his counsel’s failure to submit evidence to the Immigration Court, appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 24, 2004, decision, or file a timely motion to reconsider. Thus, he was aware of the deficiencies in his former attorney’s conduct but did not timely pursue any action regarding his conduct. Moreover, the impetus for the filing of the motion to reopen appears to be less related to any actions or conduct by the respondent’s former counsel and more related to the fact that the Form I-130 filed on his behalf was approved in September 2005. Because we find that the respondent did not act with due diligence, we agree with the Immigration Judge that his motion is not subject to equitable tolling and was properly denied as untimely. Thus, we need not address the issues of whether the respondent complied with the 1requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), or whether his counsel was ineffective and he was prejudiced thereby.
 
During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand the record for consideration of his application for adjustment of status. A motion to remand filed with the Board must, among other things, state the new facts to be considered at the reopened hearing and must be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary materials demonstrating prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). In support of his motion, the respondent submitted a duplicate copy of a Notice of Approval of Relative Immigrant Visa Petition from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services indicating that the Form I-130 filed on his behalf by his wife was approved on September 23, 2005. While the respondent also provided a copy of his application for adjustment of status (Form I-485), his marriage certificate, and evidence of the bona fides of his marriage, he has failed to explain why this evidence was “not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Thus, we cannot conclude that these proceedings should be remanded on the basis of “circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the bearing.” Id. Further, we note that granting the respondent’s motion would undermine the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his request for a continuance pending the adjudication of the Form I-130 filed on his behalf, and would reward him for his delay in filing evidence previously requested by the Immigration Judge. In order to avoid this unjust result, we deny the respondent’s motion in the exercise of discretion. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed and his motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lauren H. Mason, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mike Ochoa
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the February 16, 2007, decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s request for reopening of the August 30, 2006, in absentia order. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).¿FN1º
 
The respondent, a citizen and native of China, was arrested near McAllen, Texas, on June 11, 2006. Exh. 1 at 3. She admitted to being present in the United States without having been admitted or paroled after inspection. Exh. 2 at 2. The next day, she was given several documents, including a Notice to Appear at a hearing before an Immigration Judge in Harlingen, Texas, on August 30, 2006. Id.; Exh. 1 at 1. Through a Mandarin interpreter, an immigration officer also advised the respondent that she should find a good lawyer to handle her case. Exh. B at 2. The immigration officer also gave the respondent a list of free or low-cost legal service providers in the area of Harlingen-Brownsville, Texas. Id. Instead of contacting these providers, the respondent traveled to Los Angeles (where she apparently had a few friends and acquaintances). Id On or about June 23, 2006, she went to the offices of a two-attorney law firm in Los Angeles. Exh. E. While there, she spoke to an “American looking man” through a “Korean speaking lady” who served as an interpreter (the respondent’s best language is Korean). Id. The interpreter apparently first told the respondent that the documents she had indicated that she should go to court in Texas. Id. The respondent apparently asked if someone from the firm could go with her to court (although she has never indicated what the reply to this question was). Id.; Exh. B at 2. The respondent was then apparently told that she should not go to the Texas immigration court and that if she did, she would be arrested and sent back to China. Id. On appeal, the respondent contends that “¿aºlthough it is not clear that either attorney actually gave ¿meº the wrong advice, their employee did and they should be held responsible.” Respondent’s Brief at 7.
 
Where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is made, certain criteria must be met. Specifically, the claim must be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make, counsel must be informed of the allegations against him or her and provided an opportunity to respond, and the respondent must indicate whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2006) (citing Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487, 497-498 (5th Cir. 2000) (upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada)). It is questionable as to whether an ineffective assistance of counsel claim can be made based on representations made by nonattorney interpreters of a law firm. Regardless, the Lozada requirements have not been met in this case: the respondent has failed to identify the nonattorney employee in question, she has not shown that the “American looking man” (or any attorney affiliated with this law firm) actually agreed to represent her, and she has failed to establish that an agreement was entered into with respect to actions to be taken on her behalf.
 
*2 In short, the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent’s decision to rely upon the alleged instructions to not attend the immigration hearing in Texas on August 30, 2006, is not an “exceptional circumstance” within the meaning of section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. I.J. at 2. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
John M. Pope, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Linda I. Spencer-Walters
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 In a decision dated December 13, 2006, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal to Mexico, should he fail to avail himself of voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge noted that any claims for relief were deemed abandoned, since no applications had been filed by the due date of August 8, 2005. The respondent has, through counsel, filed an appeal and a motion to remand. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal but has not addressed the motion. Since the appeal will be sustained, the motion to remand is moot.
 
The basis for the appeal and motion, in its essence, is that the respondent was prejudiced by ineffective assistance, not of counsel, but of a paralegal employed by counsel. It is maintained that the paralegal, having been assigned to do so, failed to file the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal in a timely manner.
 
A review of the record reveals that current counsel has represented the respondent as least since May 2004. Counsel, or his partner, was present at every hearing held in the respondent’s case. At the hearing held on April 6, 2005, counsel’s partner, Mr. Stender, appeared with the respondent and was informed by the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 25) that the respondent’s application for cancellation was due no later than August 8, 2005. The respondent indicated his understanding of his duty to cooperate with counsel in the preparation of his application. The application was not timely filed.
 
In an affidavit, counsel has stated that the paralegal who was responsible for filing the application was subsequently terminated after making “many mistakes,” including failing to meet deadlines.
 
The counsel of record, not an employee with no direct representational relationship with the respondent, was ultimately responsible for the submission of any and all applications in a timely manner. Under the circumstances, the Immigration Judge’s action in this matter was not unreasonable. Rules of procedure for Immigration Courts exist, in part, to ensure the timely submission of evidence and applications in proceedings. Neither the alien nor the administrative process is well-served by the piecemeal or untimely submission of pertinent documents in a particular case, especially applications for relief.
 
Ineffective assistance cases are generally governed by the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Azanor v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2004); Lata v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 204 F.3d 1241 (9th Cir. 2000). Insufficient compliance with those guidelines has been demonstrated in this case. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this case arises, has stated that the Lozada requirements “are not sacrosanct,” and that a case for ineffective assistance of counsel can be made, even without strict Lozada compliance, where the record shows a “clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” See, e.g., Granados-Oseguera v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 993 (9th Cir. 2006); Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582 (9th Cir. 2006); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 In our view, this case presents such a situation. The respondent was prevented a reasonable opportunity to present his case, since he was not even able to have his application for cancellation of removal considered, due to counsel’s failure to ensure that it was timely filed. Accordingly, we deem it appropriate to sustain the appeal and remand the case for the Immigration Judge to adjudicate the respondent’s cancellation application and render a decision, either granting or denying that relief.
 
In remanding this case, we intimate no opinion as to the respondent’s eligibility or worthiness for the discretionary relief he seeks.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and the Immigration Judge’s decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
 
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Linda Osberg-Braun, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Waiver of inadmissibility; remand
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s April 16, 2007, decision denying his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), and ordering him removed from the United States as charged. In addition, the respondent has filed a motion to remand in which he claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from his former attorney and in which he requests an opportunity to apply for protection as a refugee and also to seek cancellation of removal and a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion to remand will be denied.
 
The respondent was born in 1957 in Kharkov, Ukraine, when Ukraine was still part of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (“Soviet Union”). The respondent, who is Jewish, entered the United States as a refugee in 1980 after fleeing from religious persecution in the former Soviet Union. The respondent became a lawful permanent resident of the United States in 1983. In late 1990 the respondent knowingly entered into a criminal conspiracy to obstruct commerce by means of robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (1988), and in June 1993 he was convicted of that offense pursuant to a guilty plea in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. In early 2003 the respondent left the United States and traveled abroad, returning to this country on January 17, 2003, at which time he presented himself for inspection before an immigration officer and requested entry to the United States as a returning lawful permanent resident. On the basis of the aforementioned conviction, however, the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) declined the respondent’s request to reenter the United States and placed him in the present removal proceedings, in which he is charged as an arriving alien who is inadmissible by virtue of having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. Sections 101(a)(13)(C)(v) and 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) and 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). The respondent does not dispute the charge of inadmissibility on appeal.
 
During his proceedings before the Immigration Judge the respondent applied for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act pursuant to INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001), but the Immigration Judge denied the application in the exercise of discretion. On appeal, the respondent does not explicitly challenge the Immigration Judge’s discretionary decision. Instead, he argues that the denial of his application was attributable to the ineffective assistance of his former attorney, who failed to provide the Immigration Judge with sufficient evidence of his favorable equities. In his appellate brief and his motion to remand, moreover, the respondent argues that former counsel was ineffective by accepting the Immigration Court’s designation of Ukraine as his country of removal and by failing to seek various other forms of relief on the respondent’s behalf, such as asylum, withholding of removal, cancellation of removal, and a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act.
 
*2 At the outset, we find no basis for disturbing the Immigration Judge’s discretionary denial of the respondent’s application for a section 212(c) waiver. The respondent’s 1993 conviction for conspiracy to obstruct commerce by robbery is a compelling adverse discretionary factor that can be overcome, if at all, only upon a showing of unusual and outstanding countervailing equities. The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had failed to demonstrate such equities, and the respondent does not argue to the contrary on appeal. Instead, he claims that prior counsel was ineffective by failing to obtain more evidence in support of the respondent’s application and by failing to elicit more persuasive testimony of hardship from the respondent’s wife and child.
 
To justify plenary rehearing on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent must demonstrate that he suffered substantial prejudice arising from counsel’s deficient performance; that is, he must demonstrate a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different but for prior counsel’s errors. See Dakane v. United States Attorney General, 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005). In this instance the respondent has done nothing more than to assert that prior counsel failed to obtain strong documentary and testimonial evidence in support of his application for section 212(c) relief. He makes no proffer of additional evidence relevant to section 212(c) relief on appeal, and does not explain with particularity what evidence he would have submitted to meet his burden had counsel been more effective. Under the circumstances, the respondent has not demonstrated that prior counsel’s ineffectiveness deprived him of a meaningful opportunity to present his section 212(c) request to the Immigration Judge. Accordingly, we find no due process violation.
 
The respondent’s other claims arising from the alleged ineffectiveness of former counsel suffer from a similar defect. For example, the respondent claims that counsel should have sought cancellation of removal and a section 212(h) waiver on his behalf, but he has failed to offer any evidence to suggest the existence of any previously undisclosed equitable considerations that would have caused the Immigration Judge to resolve those discretionary applications differently from the aforementioned application for section 212(c) relief. We note in this regard that the discretionary calculus followed in cases arising under former section 212(c) of the Act is not materially different from that which would have been applied in connection with any request for cancellation of removal or a section 212(h) waiver. See Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7, 11 (BIA 1998) (holding that the general standards and considerations for the exercise of discretion outlined in Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581 (BIA 1978), were “equally appropriate in considering requests for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act.”); Matter of Mendez, 21 I&N Dec. 296, 300 (BIA 1996) 2 (providing that the discretionary analysis set forth in Matter of Marin, supra, is an appropriate guide in section 212(h) cases). Absent a proffer of evidence reflecting the existence of equitable considerations that were not previously presented to the Immigration Judge because of prior counsel’s ineffectiveness, we find no substantial prejudice arising from prior counsel’s “failure” to request cancellation of removal and a section 212(h) waiver on the respondent’s behalf.
 
*3 The respondent also argues that former counsel should have requested refugee protection on his behalf, presumably under the asylum and withholding of removal provisions of sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158 and 1231(b)(3).¿FN1º Again, we find no substantial prejudice arising from prior counsel’s failure to seek these forms of relief because the respondent’s 1993 conviction for conspiracy to commit robbery is prima facie a “particularly serious crime” barring both forms of relief, Matter of Carballe, 19 I&N Dec. 357 (BIA 1986), and the respondent has proffered no evidence to suggest that there are specific mitigating facts that would militate against such a designation in his case.¿FN2º See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(d)(2) and 1240.8(d) (indicating that where a ground for mandatory denial of an application for relief may apply, the applicant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the ground is inapplicable).
 
Finally, the respondent was not prejudiced by prior counsel’s designation of Ukraine as his country of removal. Specifically, had the respondent declined to designate a country of removal, the Attorney General could not have directed his removal to the country of citizenship, i.e., the Soviet Union, because that country no longer exists, and therefore the proper designation would have been to “the country from which the alien was admitted to the United States.” See section 241 (b)(2)(E)(i) of the Act. We recognize that Ukraine was not an independent “country” at the time of the respondent’s admission to the United States in 1980; however, the word ‘country’ is construed in this context to include not just the political entity of which the alien may have been a subject at the time of his entrance into the United States, but also the geographical area or territory from which the alien came. See, e.g., Ademi v. INS, 31 F.3d 517, 521 n.7 (7th Cir. 1994); Bajalieh v. Beechie, 309 F.2d 386, 389 & n.5 (9th Cir. 1962); United States ex rel. Tom We Shung v. Murff, 176 F. Supp. 253 (S.D.N.Y. 1959), aff’d, 274 NF.2d 667(2d Cir. 1960); Seif v. Nagle, 14F.2d 416, 417(9th Cir. 1926), cert.denied, 273 U.S. 737 (1926); United States ex rel. Mensevich v. Tod, 264 U.S. 134, 136 (1924). While the respondent argues that he cannot be removed to Ukraine without evidence that Ukraine will accept him, the Supreme Court has found that prior consent of the country designated for removal is not a precondition for entry of a removal order under section 241 (b)(2)(E)(i) of the Act. Jama v. Immigration & Customs Enforcement, 543 U.S. 335, 345 n.5, 346-48 (2005).
 
*4 In conclusion, the respondent has failed to identify any reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his application for section 212(c) relief in the exercise of discretion, and he has also failed to demonstrate that he has been prejudiced by the allegedly ineffective assistance of his former attorney, so as to warrant a remand for plenary rehearing. Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Holly S. Cooper, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Patricia Spaletta
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before this Board on July 24, 2007. On October 22, 2007, 90 days after our decision, the respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, filed a motion to reopen with this Board. Due to a clerical error, this Board mistakenly rejected the respondent’s motion for failure to include a fee or a fee waiver request. On October 31, 2007, we acknowledged receipt of the respondent’s motion filed on October 22, 2007. The applicable regulations provide that motions to reopen be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceedings sought to be reopened. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Therefore, we find that the respondent’s motion to reopen is timely filed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent makes an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his prior counsel and claims that he derived United States citizenship from his mother. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes reopening. The motion will be granted and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
We will first review the procedural history of this case. The respondent is a native and citizen of El Salvador and has been a lawful permanent resident since 1990. In August 2004, the DHS charged him with removability under section 237(a)(2)(B)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(I), as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation. An Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), on December 9, 2004 (Exh. 2). No appeal was taken from that decision. On June 2, 2005, the respondent was convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon with two convictions in violation of section 12021(a) of the California Penal Code. As a result, he was again placed in removal proceedings and charged with having been convicted of an aggravated felony, to wit, a firearms offense. See section 101(a)(43)(E) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(E). On April 20, 2007, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to terminate removal proceedings based on his claim of derivative citizenship under former section 321 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1432, and ordered the respondent removed from the United States as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. On July 24, 2007, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal. We held that the respondent did not derive United States citizenship from his mother, who naturalized in 1995 when the respondent was 17 years old. Under former section 321 (a)(3) of the Act, a child born outside the United States of alien parents becomes a citizen of the United States upon “the naturalization of the mother if the child was born out of wedlock and the paternity of the child has not been established by legitimation,” provided that both the mother’s naturalization and the child’s admission to lawful permanent residence occurred prior to the child’s 18th birthday. See former section 321 (a)(3) of the Act.
 
*2 The respondent claims that he is not considered legitimated under Salvadoran law. In Matter of Moraga, 23 I&N Dec. 195, 198 (BIA 2001), which involved a visa petition filed on behalf of a child beneficiary who was born out of wedlock, the Board observed that El Salvador eliminated the legal distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children on December 16, 1983, thereby placing children born out of wedlock in the same legal position as those born in wedlock. We concluded that El Salvador’s removal of that legal distinction meant that “all natural children are deemed to be the legitimate or legitimated offspring of their natural father from the time that country’s law changed,” as long as they were under 18 years of age on the date of enactment. Matter of Moraga, supra, at 199.
 
However, in Matter of Rowe, 23 I&N Dec. 962, 967 (BIA 2006), this Board dealt with a similar statute under Guyanese law. The alien in Matter of Rowe, supra, was born out of wedlock in Guyana and claimed that he derived United States citizenship through his mother under former section 321(a)(3) of the Act. The Immigration Judge rejected Rowe’s citizenship claim, concluding that the Guyanese Removal of Discrimination Act of 1983 had eliminated all legal distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate children, thereby “legitimating” Rowe by operation of law and precluding him from deriving United States citizenship solely through his mother. In arriving at that conclusion, the Immigration Judge relied on this Board’s decision in Matter of Goorahoo, 20 I&N Dec. 782 (BIA 1994), where we held that children born out of wedlock in Guyana after the effective date of the Removal of Discrimination Act were to be considered the “legitimate” children of their biological fathers for preference allocation purposes.
 
The Board in Matter of Rowe reversed the Immigration Judge’s decision and held that, for purposes of the immigration laws of the United States, Guyana’s statute forbidding discrimination against “illegitimate” children was not sufficient to effect the automatic “legitimation” of children born out of wedlock. Matter of Rowe, supra, at 966-67. Instead, we noted that under Guyana’s Legitimacy Ordinance the only means by which a child born out of wedlock could be truly “legitimated” was by the marriage of his or her parents. Id. at 967. Accordingly, we overruled Matter of Goorahoo, supra, and held, subject to future changes in Guyanese law, that a Guyanese child born out of wedlock could only be legitimated within the meaning of the immigration laws—whether for preference allocation or derivative citizenship purposes—by the marriage of his biological parents. Id. And since Rowe’s parents had never married, we concluded that he had derived United States citizenship under former section 321(a)(3) of the Act upon the naturalization of his mother. Id.
 
*3 In the instant case, the record is insufficient for us to determine whether the changes brought about by the modifications in the law in 1983 in El Salvador regarding children born out of wedlock not only served to eliminate discrimination between legitimate and illegitimate children but also automatically legitimated children born out of wedlock. We note that in Matter of Moroga, supra, at 198, the Board referred to article 279 of the Civil Code of El Salvador, which provided a means of legitimation for children born out of wedlock. However, it is unclear if this law remains in effect. This Board has previously determined that the law of a foreign country is a question of fact. See Matter of Annang, 14 I&N Dec. 502, 503 (BIA 1973); see also Matter of Kumah, 19 I&N Dec. 290, 292 (BIA 1985); Matter of Khatoon, 19 I&N Dec. 153, 154 (BIA 1984) (relying upon an expert memorandum of foreign law from the Library of Congress to establish the validity of a Moslem adoption under the Hindu Code in India). In light of the Board’s inability to make findings of fact in the course of deciding appeals, the obvious significance of the respondent’s citizenship claim, and lack of clarity regarding Salvadoran law concerning legitimation, we find it appropriate to sua sponte reopen proceedings and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i); 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent should present evidence, including citations and copies of Salvadoran law, regarding whether the elimination of the legal distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children automatically legitimated children born out of wedlock or merely served as an anti-discrimination measure. The respondent should also submit evidence regarding whether or not there are means by which legitimation may be accomplished in El Salvador. Furthermore, the Immigration Judge, through the submission of evidence from the parties, shall determine whether article 279 of the Civil Code of El Salvador, which provided a means of legitimation for children born out of wedlock, remains in effect. See Matter of Moraga, supra, at 198. Upon remand, the DHS shall also be given the opportunity to present additional evidence and address any evidence submitted by the respondent. Therefore, we will not address the other arguments at this time.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s July 24, 2007, decision is hereby vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on August 27, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision that, among other things, denied his motion to terminate the removal proceedings based on his claim of derivative citizenship and ordered him removed to his native Colombia. In that decision, we concluded that the respondent failed to derive United States citizenship from his mother under former section 321(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1432, upon her naturalization on May 16, 1996, because the respondent had failed to demonstrate that his mother had actual uncontested custody of him at the time of her naturalization. On November 26, 2007, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen his removal proceedings. The motion will be denied.
 
In his motion to reopen, the respondent initially argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his claim of derivative citizenship and deprived him of due process during his removal proceedings by hampering his ability to present his claim of derivative citizenship. However, in that regard, his motion is more in the nature of a motion to reconsider than a motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1) (providing that a motion to reconsider is a challenge to errors of fact or law in the Board’s decision); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 2001) (stating that motions to reopen and motions to reconsider are separate and distinct motions with different requirements). The motion is untimely because it was not filed within 30 days of our August 27, 2007, order, and the respondent has offered no explanation for his untimely filing to justify the equitable tolling of that deadline. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); cf. Ghahremani v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 993, 999-1000 (9th Cir. 2007) (noting that an alien seeking equitable tolling of the period for filing a motion to reopen must show that he exercised due diligence in vindicating his rights). Moreover, upon review of the respondent’s arguments and all relevant portions of the record, we conclude that the respondent has failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances that would warrant sua sponte reconsideration of our August 27, 2007, order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997).
 
The respondent also argues that reopening of his proceedings is warranted based on new evidence that was previously unavailable to him that demonstrates his eligibility for derivative citizenship. While such evidence, if present, would warrant reopening, see 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (c)(2), the respondent has presented no such evidence here. In that regard, most of the evidence accompanying the respondent’s motion to reopen was either already presented to the Immigration Court (Motion to Reopen, Exhs. G-K, M; see also Record of Proceedings Exh. 3, Tab D; Exh. 5, Tabs 1-7, Exh. 11, Tabs 1-7) or substantially identical in form and substance to evidence that was submitted before the Immigration Court (Motion to Reopen, Exhs. B, D; Record of Proceedings, Exh. 9). Moreover, the respondent has not shown that the “new” affidavits prepared by himself, his mother, and his godfather after our August 27, 2007, decision could not have been discovered or presented at his May 17, 2007, hearing before the Immigration Judge (Motion to Reopen, Exhs. A, C, F). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). The respondent also has not shown that the evidence regarding his arrival and departure dates from Colombia between 1993 and 2000 could not have been discovered or presented at his May 17, 2007, removal proceedings (Motion to Reopen, Exh. E). See id.
 
*2 Finally, we reject the respondent’s contention that reopening is warranted based on ineffective assistance of counsel. As the respondent himself acknowledges, he has failed to comply with any of the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (1988), for claims alleging ineffective assistance of counsel (Motion to Reopen, Affidavit of the Respondent). See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (BIA 2000) (recognizing that the Lozada requirements are generally reasonable, and that under ordinary circumstances the Board does not abuse its discretion when it denies a motion to remand or reopen based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel where the petitioner fails to meet the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra). Moreover, we do not find plain evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel in the record that would excuse the respondent’s noncompliance with Matter of Lozada, supra. Cf. id. at 526 (compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, not required where the record was undisputed that the alien’s lawyer failed, without any reason, to file an application for suspension of deportation in spite of having told the alien that he did file it); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir.) (compliance with Matter of Lozada, supra, not required where it was plain from the administrative record that counsel was being represented by an attorney whom she had never met and who had no understanding of her case), amended by 213 F.3d 1221 (9th Cir. 2000). An alien who raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must demonstrate that counsel failed to perform with sufficient competence, and must establish that he was prejudiced by counsel’s performance. See Grigoryan v. Keisler, 507 F.3d 1206, 1210 (9th Cir. 2007). The respondent has failed to make that showing. Specifically, given the lack of any evidence that the respondent’s mother was awarded legal custody of him from the Colombian government following her divorce from the respondent’s father, the respondent cannot show that he sustained prejudice from his former counsel’s alleged failure to inquire whether his mother was awarded foreign legal custody of him and to advise him that a foreign court’s grant of legal custody may have changed the outcome of these proceedings. We also find no support in the record for the respondent’s general allegations that counsel failed to “keep herself abreast of relevant and significant applications and proper understanding of ¿iºmmigration ¿s ºtatutes, (Motion to Reopen at 22), that counsel “was very untruthful, unprofessional and had a serious problem with procrastinating (Motion at 23),” or that counsel hid her record of prior Florida Bar suspensions from the respondent and the Immigration Court (Motion to 23).¿FN1º
 
*3 For the foregoing reasons, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that reopening of these proceedings is warranted. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

We note that the record shows that the respondent’s counsel did, in fact, admit to her prior suspensions at the respondent’s immigration proceedings and that the Immigration Judge rejected the Department of Homeland Security’s assertion that she had improperly failed to indicate that she was “subject” to an order of suspension by an administrative agency in her Form EOIR-28 (Notice of Entry of Appearance or Representative Before the Immigration Court) in light of those previous suspensions (Tr. at 32-34).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William H. Oltarsh, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decisions dated January 3, 2007, and January 9, 2007, denying the respondent’s motions to reopen. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States, following the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing on December 6, 2006. The appeals will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the respondent was scheduled to appear for a hearing on December 6, 2006, in Atlanta, Georgia. On December 4, 2006, the respondent filed a motion to change venue. The respondent failed to appear for the hearing on December 6, 2006, and was ordered removed in absentia, The respondent subsequently filed a motion to reopen, in which his attorney of record, William H. Oltarsh, Esquire, stated that his own spouse was suffering from terminal cancer, and that he failed to advise the respondent that he had to appear for his hearing on December 6, 2006. With the motion to reopen, the respondent submitted a sworn statement requesting that venue be changed to New York, New York. However, the respondent failed to provide any explanation for his failure to appear at the hearing on December 6, 2006. The Immigration Judge found that the attorney’s filings admit actual notice of the hearing, and failure to notify the respondent is not a basis for reopening absent a Lozada affidavit. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). On appeal, Mr. Oltarsh has submitted a sworn statement in which he indicates that he believes he informed the respondent that he was required to appear for a master calendar hearing in Atlanta, Georgia, but Mr. Oltarsh cannot remember the exact details due to his wife’s terminal illness.
 
The Board has held that the mere filing of a motion for a change of venue does not relieve the respondent of his responsibility to appear, and unless the Immigration Judge grants the motion, the respondent remains obligated to appear at the appointed date and time. Matter of Rivera, 19 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1988); Matter of Patel, 19 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 1985), aff’d, Patel v. INS, 803 F.2d 804 (5th Cir. 1986). Furthermore, we have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). The respondent has not asserted that he failed to appear due to ineffective assistance of counsel, nor has he submitted an affidavit in support of such a claim. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent had proper notice of his hearing, and an attorney’s failure to notify a client is not a basis for reopening absent compliance with Lozada. As the respondent failed to submit an affidavit in support of his motion to reopen pursuant to Lozada, the Immigration Judge correctly determined that reopening is not warranted in this matter.
 
*2 The respondent also appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 9, 2007, denying the respondent’s second motion to reopen filed on January 4, 2007. The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the exceptional circumstances must relate to the respondent, such that the illness of counsel’s spouse does not constitute an exceptional circumstance. Furthermore, the respondent’s second motion to reopen is number-barred pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Accordingly, the respondent’s appeals are dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jon Wu, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) º - Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
  
APPLICATION: Admission as a returning resident
 
In a decision dated August 4, 2006, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and denied her application for admission as a returning resident. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s finding that she abandoned her lawful permanent residence. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of the Phillippines who was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident with her family in 1986 when she was 13 years of age (Tr. at 16-17). After spending 1 month in the United States, the respondent and her family returned to the Philippines to allow the respondent to continue her education there (Tr. at 17-18). The respondent visited the United States for an additional 3 months in 1987 before returning to the Phillippines to continue her schooling (Tr. at 18-19). The respondent continued her studies and ultimately graduated from college in the Phillippines in 1995 when she was 22 years of age (Tr. at 22-23, 25). At that time, the respondent wanted to return to the United States, but her parents told her she needed to remain in the Phillippines to take care of her maternal grandmother, who had become terminally ill and was expected to live only until 1996 (Tr. at 22-23, 26-27). Accordingly, the respondent remained in the Phillippines. She obtained a full-time job and helped take care of her grandmother when she was not working (Tr. at 55).
 
The respondent’s maternal grandmother actually lived longer than 1 year and passed away on April 17, 1998 (Tr. at 28; Exh. 4, Tab E). At that point, the respondent did not immediately return to the United States; rather, in accordance with Filipino cultural norms, she remained in mourning for 1 year in the Phillippines following her maternal grandmother’s death (Tr. at 28-29). The respondent continued to work full-time during that period, however (Tr. at 55). After her year of mourning passed, she again decided to return to the United States (Tr. at 29-31). Nevertheless, she did not try to travel to the United States until she obtained her family’s approval to do so sometime in 2000.
 
In July 2000, the respondent attempted to board an airplane for the United States and learned, allegedly for the first time, that she could not reenter the United States without a reentry permit (Tr. at 32). The respondent attempted to obtain more information about obtaining a reentry permit from an Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) office in the Phillippines (Tr. at 32-33). She was told she would need certain documents to obtain a reentry permit and to contact an attorney for further assistance (Tr. at 33). The respondent chose to obtain these documents before even contacting an attorney (Tr. at 34-36). Sometime in August 2001, she retained an attorney named Dr. Solomon Burgess to help her obtain a reentry permit (Tr. at 34). According to the respondent, under Burgess’s direction she executed an application for a reentry permit (Form I- 131) (Tr. at 37-38). The record reflects that the respondent signed her Form 1-131 on August 8, 2001; however, for some reason, it was not submitted until January 24, 2002 (Exh. 2A).¿FN1º At some point, the application was evidently returned, and the respondent later refiled the Form I- 131 on September 26, 2002 (Exh. 2A; Exh. 3, Tab D). However, the agency did not ultimately issue the respondent a reentry permit (Form I-327) until January 29, 2004 (Exh. 7).¿FN2º The DHS sent the Form 1-327 to the respondent’s paternal grandmother’s home in Seattle sometime in February 2004 (Exh. 4, Tab B). The respondent’s paternal grandmother promptly forwarded that document to the respondent (Exh. 4, Tab B; Exh. 6).
 
*2 On April 13, 2004, the respondent returned to the United States with her passport, green card, and the Form I-327. Her inspection was deferred, she was interviewed, and a sworn statement was taken (Exh. 2B). She stated in the interview that she had always believed her green card allowed her to reside permanently in the United States, that she was not aware until 2000 that she would need a Form I- 327 to reenter the United States, and that she intended to reside permanently in the United States (Exh. 2B). The respondent was placed in removal proceedings and charged with removability under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), for not being in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, or other valid entry document at the port of entry.¿FN3º
 
Section 211 (b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1181 (b), allows a waiver of the document requirements in section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Act for returning resident immigrants. However, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was not entitled to admission because she had abandoned her lawful permanent resident status. First, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent “most likely” lost her permanent resident status while she was still a minor when her family returned to the Phillippines without any intent to return permanently to the United States for at least 6 to 10 years while she was attending school in the Phillippines (I.J. at 5). The Immigration Judge concluded in the alternative that, even if the respondent’s parents’ likely abandonment of status was not imputed to her, she herself abandoned her lawful permanent resident status when she remained in the Phillippines after she finished college in 1995 but made no effort to come to the United States until 2000 (I.J. at 5). The Immigration Judge was unpersuaded that the respondent was a “necessary part of the family plan for her grandmother’s care” following her graduation from college in light of the evidence showing that the respondent worked full-time as a professional while both she and her mother were taking care of her grandmother (I.J. at 5). The Immigration Judge concluded that any cultural norms that allegedly prevented the respondent from acting independently of her family did not negate her responsibility to demonstrate her true intent to reside permanently in the United States (I.J. at 5). The Immigration Judge was particularly troubled by the fact that the respondent did not make any effort to contact the American embassy when her reason for delaying her return to the United States changed, and that she had made no effort to change or update her immigration file until 2000 (I.J. at 5-6). Accordingly, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for admission and ordered her removal from the United States (I.J. at 6).
 
*3 On appeal, the respondent argues that her study abroad did not establish an abandonment of her permanent residency status. Likewise, she asserts that her decision to stay in the Phillippines to care for her maternal grandmother for a fixed period of time did not constitute an abandonment of her lawful permanent residence. The respondent further contends that her delay in seeking a reentry permit was due to Burgess’s ineffective assistance of counsel, and that she should not be deemed to have abandoned her permanent residency status based on his acts.
 
Where, as here, the respondent has a colorable claim of lawful permanent resident status, the burden is on the DHS to demonstrate by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that she abandoned that status. See Matter of Kane, 15 I&N Dec. 258, 264 (BIA 1975). To qualify as a returning resident immigrant, an alien must be an immigrant lawfully admitted for permanent residence who has retained that status from the time she acquired it and must be returning to an unrelinquished lawful permanent residence from a temporary visit abroad. See section 101 (a)(27)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 211.1(b); Singh v. Reno, 113 F.3d 1512, 1514 (9th Cir. 1997); Matter of Huang, 19 I&N Dec. 749, 753 (BIA 1988). A permanent resident returns from a temporary visit abroad only when (1) her visit is for a period relatively short, fixed by some early event, or (2) her visit will terminate upon the occurrence of an event having a reasonable possibility of occurring within a relatively short period of time. See Khodhagholian v. Ashcroft, 335 F.3d 1003, 1007 (9th Cir. 2003) (internal citation and quotation omitted). Where the length of the visit is contingent upon the occurrence of an event and is not fixed in time and the event does not occur within a relatively short period of time, the visit will only be considered a “temporary visit abroad” if the alien has a continuous, uninterrupted intention to return to the United States during the entirety of her visit. Id. (emphasis added). The relevant intent is not the desire to return ultimately to the United States; rather, it is the intent to retum to the United States within a relatively short period of relevant foreign events. Singh v. Reno, supra, at 1514. A trip abroad may also be extended beyond a relatively short period so long as the alien intends to return to the United States as soon as possible thereafter. Id.
 
We will assume for the sake of argument that the respondent’s parents did not abandon their lawful permanent status while she was a minor such that their abandonment of status could be imputed to her. Cf. Matter ofZamora, 17 I&N Dec. 395 (BIA 1980) (holding that the voluntary and intended abandonment of a lawful permanent resident status by the mother was imputed to a child who was an unemancipated minor at the time his mother abandoned her lawful permanent resident status).¿FN4º Even so, we concur with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent abandoned her lawful permanent resident status and, thus, is ineligible for admission as a returning resident. We agree with the respondent that her trip abroad to complete her studies, as well as her immediate extension of that trip to care for her ailing grandmother and then mourn for her grandmother in accordance with Fillipino tradition, did not constitute an abandonment of status. Singh v. Reno, supra, at 1514. Nonetheless, we share the Immigration Judge’s concerns that the respondent did not even attempt to contact the American embassy when her reasons for being in the Phillippines changed in 1995 from her original plan of acquiring an education to her new plan of caring for and then mourning her grandmother, despite her having spent virtually the entire period of her lawful permanent residence outside the United States.¿FN5º
 
*4 Moreover, the respondent’s subsequent actions negated that she had a continuous, uninterrupted intent to return to the United States. Specifically, we deem significant that the respondent waited more than 1 fullyear after the end of her mourning period before even attempting to return to the United States. Then, even after being expressly notified that she would not be able to return to the United States without a reentry permit, the respondent waited another full year before contacting an attorney who could assist her with her return. The respondent’s decision to gather documents during that period that might help her in returning to the country does not excuse her delay in contacting an attorney or in otherwise failing to evidence an intent to return to the United States between 2000 and 2001. Burgess’s alleged ineffective assistance is nondispositive in this case because by the time that alleged conduct transpired the respondent had already abandoned her lawful resident status.
 
For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s application for admission as a returning lawful permanent resident. We also reject the respondent’s remaining arguments. The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge’s decision deprived her of due process because, prior to all relevant events, she had never received notice that she could abandon her lawful permanent resident status. However, the law regarding abandonment of lawful permanent residence was already well-settled when the respondent left the United States. See, e.g., Santos v. 1NS, 421 F.2d 1303 (9th Cir. 1970); Matter of Kane, supra. Moreover, the respondent has not shown prejudice because she has not shown that her awareness of that law would have influenced her actions. Finally, we lack jurisdiction to entertain the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge’s decision violates her equal-protection rights. See Matter of C-, 20 I&N Dec. 529, 532 (BIA 1992).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The circumstances surrounding the initial filing of the Form I-131 with the INS are unclear from the record. In that regard, the respondent testified that sometime in September or October 2001 Burgess advised her that he had filed the Form I-131 with the INS but that it might be delayed because of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States (Tr. at 38-40). The respondent also testified that, in January 2002, she learned that the INS had sent a letter to her from paternal grandmother’s home in Seattle, Washington advising her that she needed to supply personal photographs with her application (Tr. at 40-42). However, in her personal affidavit the respondent indicated that the INS sent her paternal grandmother a letter at some unspecified time that stated something entirely different—namely, confirming her interest in filing a Form I-131 and asking her to submit a processing fee with a Form I-131 (Exh. 4, Tab B). Based on this communication, the respondent attested, she believed that Burgess never filed a Form I-131 on her behalf and, upon the advice of her paternal grandmother, decided to fill out a Form 1-131 on her own and sent that application to the INS via her paternal grandmother from her home in the Phillippines, independently of any interaction with Burgess (Exh. 4, Tab B). In any event, however, it is undisputed that the respondent’s Form I-131 was initially filed on January 24, 2002.

2

On March 1, 2003, the former INS was abolished and its functions transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Title IV of Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Star. 2135 (Nov. 25, 2002). See Matter of D-J, 23 I&N Dec. 572, 573 n.1 (A.G. 2003). For purposes of clarity, we will refer to the agency as the DHS in the remainder of this order.

3

On appeal, the respondent does not contest that her Form I-327 was invalid because she applied for that document while she was residing outside of the United States. See 8 C.F.R. § 211.1(a)(3) (requiring an arriving alien such as the respondent, see section 101 (a)(13)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C), to present, if applicable, a valid unexpired Form I-327) (emphasis added); see also 8 C.F.R. § 223.2(b)(1) (allowing approval of a Form I-327 if it was filed by a lawful permanent resident from within the United States).

4

However, we do note that the respondent’s parents’ desire to retain their lawful status during the relevant period, without conduct to support that professed desire, would not have been sufficient for them to retain their lawful permanent resident status. See Khodhagholian v. Ashcroft, supra, at 1007 (internal citations and quotation omitted).

5

The respondent asserts in her notice of appeal that she was unaware it was even possible to abandon her lawful permanent resident status until she attempted to travel to the United States in 2000. If true, that might explain her failure to take steps prior to that time to ascertain the validity of her lawful permanent resident status. However, we afford that assertion no weight in light of her conduct both before and after that event, which, as we are about to discuss, negates her claim that she always intended to reside in the United States permanently.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Isuf Kola, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brendan Curran
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 10, 2007. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2007). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2007).
 
The respondent was convicted of Retail Theft on July 24, 2006. He was sentenced to probation. Because he violated probation, he was resentenced to two years in jail. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable for having an aggravated felony relating to theft.
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that removability was not proved. The Immigration and Nationality Act provides that “Any alien … in and admitted to the United States shall, upon the order of the Attorney General, be removed if the alien is within one or more of the following classes of deportable aliens …. (iii) Aggravated Felony.--Any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.” See 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (1996). The term “aggravated felony” includes a theft offense (including receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment ¿isº at least one year.” See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G) (1997).
 
Within the record is an information charging the respondent with Retail Theft and a certified statement of conviction and disposition. That document indicates that the respondent pled guilty to the charge and was sentenced to probation on July 24, 2006. It also indicates that the respondent was found guilty of violating probation and sentenced to two years on April 24, 2007. We find clear and convincing evidence of removability. See Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276, 286 (1966); 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3) (1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(a) (2007). Cf. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.15, 1240.10 (2007).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent also disputes that he received a two-year jail sentence for the theft offense. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment following revocation of probation is a modification of the original sentence. See U.S. v. Hidalgo-Marcias, 300 F.3d 281, 284-85 (2nd Cir. 2002) (conviction for attempted burglary became an aggravated felony after probation was revoked and sentenced to an additional one-year sentence); U.S. v. Jimenez, 258 F.3d 1120, 1125-26 (9th Cir. 2001) (conviction for infliction of corporal injury on a spouse became an aggravated felony after probation was revoked and sentenced to two years).
 
Also on appeal, the respondent claims he has received ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the respondent has failed to fulfil the prerequisites for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498, 501 (7th Cir. 2001).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Craig A. Harlow
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s July 26, 2007, decision concluding that the respondent, a native and citizen of Italy, is removable and ineligible for cancellation of removal as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. Sections 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 240A(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1229b(a)(3)(2000).
 
During his removal hearing, the respondent admitted through counsel that he was removable as charged. (Tr. 2). Having conceded that he is removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, it necessarily follows that he cannot demonstrate the absence of an aggravated felony conviction in connection with his cancellation of removal application. Applicable regulations, which have the force and effect of law as to the Immigration Judges and this Board, provide in pertinent part that “the immigration judge may determine that removability as charged has been established by the admissions of the respondent.” 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c) (2007). Accordingly, the distinct and formal concession of removability, made by the respondent’s attorney acting in his professional capacity and in the respondent’s presence during the removal hearing, is binding on the respondent as a judicial admission, and he will not now be heard to challenge the factual findings or legal conclusions of the Immigration Judge that arose from that concession. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986); cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(B) (authorizing summary dismissal of appeals when “¿tºhe only reason for the appeal specified by the party concerned involves a finding of fact or a conclusion of law that was conceded by that party at a prior proceeding”). Furthermore, the binding effect of an attorney’s concession of removability applies with equal force in a proceeding predicated on criminal convictions. Matter of Pichardo, 21 I&N Dec. 330, 333 n.2 (BIA 1996). Finally, the respondent has not argued or proven that his prior attorney’s concession of removability constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N.Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
*2 In conclusion, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision ordering the respondent removed from the United States on the basis of his attorney’s concession of removability. Because the respondent is removable and ineligible for cancellation of removal on the basis of his concession, we do not address his appellate arguments regarding the validity of the aggravated felony charge or the Immigration Judge decision pretermitting his cancellation of removal application.
 
The appeal is dismissed.

FILE: AXX XX7 519 - HARTFORD, CT
January 11, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrea R. Reid, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; reopening; remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent is a native and citizen of Jamaica. The respondent appeals an Immigration Judge’s March 9, 2007, decision, denying her request to reopen proceedings for the purpose of pursuing a new application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge with the following additions. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent alleges that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her motion to reopen, because she presented prima facie evidence that she is currently eligible for adjustment of status based on her marriage to a lawful permanent resident. However, because the respondent is an arriving alien, the Immigration Judge has no jurisdiction to consider her application for adjustment of status. This is because amendments to the regulations provide that United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) has exclusive jurisdiction over all adjustment of status applications for arriving aliens with one narrow exception. This exception permits an Immigration Judge to adjudicate an adjustment of status application for any alien who:
1. properly filed an application for adjustment of status with USCIS while the alien was in the United States;
 
2. departed from and returned to the United States pursuant to the terms of a grant of advance parole to pursue the previously filed application for adjustment of status;
 
3. the application for adjustment of status was denied by USCIS; and
 
4. DHS placed the arriving alien in removal proceedings either upon the arriving alien’s return to the United States pursuant to the grant of advance parole or after USCIS denied the application.
 
See 71 Fed. Reg. 27591-27592 (May 12, 2006) (revising 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2). Here, there is no indication that the respondent falls within this exception. For example, there is no indication that she departed from and returned to the United States pursuant to the terms of a grant of advance parole to pursue a previously filed application. Hence, we find that the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. We find that reopening is not warranted here, as the Immigration Judge does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the respondent’s application for adjustment of status in this case. Any application for adjustment must be pursued with USCIS independent of these proceedings.
 
*2 The respondent additionally requested reopening based on alleged ineffective assistance provided by her former counsel(s). However, we can not find sufficient evidence of any ineffective assistance. Rather, it is clear in the correspondence (attached to the respondent’s motion), which constituted a response to the respondent’s filed grievance, that she was told that she would have to file an appeal by January 11, 2007. There is no indication that the respondent was prevented from doing so by her former counsel(s). The former counsel(s) warned the respondent of the due date for filing the appeal and clarified that their firm had not been retained to represent the respondent on appeal. The respondent’s former counsel(s) are not required to agree to represent the respondent on appeal, and the Representation Agreement (also attached to the respondent’s motion) between the respondent and her former counsel(s) specifically indicates that the agreement does not cover appeals. One of the respondent’s former attorneys indicates, in a letter, that the respondent was told that their law firm would not handle her appeal because they did not see good prospects for success with the appeal. That does not mean that the respondent was not free to pursue the appeal without counsel or to seek other legal representation. Rather, the letter sent by that firm indicates that the respondent could pursue the appeal, and it specifically indicates that the respondent would have to discuss whether that particular firm would be willing to handle such appeal with them. Thus, it is clear from the letter that the respondent could pursue the appeal whether or not that particular firm was retained to represent the respondent in filing such appeal. In sum, the record does not sufficiently establish that the respondent’s failure to file an appeal was due to ineffective assistance provided by her former counsel(s), nor is there sufficient evidence that the assistance provided by former counsel(s) resulted in any due process violation or the deprivation of a fair hearing. See Romero v. U.S. INS, 399 F.3d 109 (2d Cir. 2005).
 
Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal of the denial of her motion to reopen, based on a new application for adjustment of status and based on ineffective assistance of counsel, is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rachel S. Ullman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Dimple R. Shah
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On May 21, 2004, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under sections 240A(b)(l)(B) and (2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.§§ 1229b(b)(l)(B) and (2)(A)(iii), based on a determination that the respondent was not a person of good moral character during the requisite periods. On July 20, 2005, the Board summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal for failure to file a brief.¿FN1º
 
The respondent did not comply with the final order of removal. Rather, she continued to work without authorization as a nanny. The respondent filed the instant motion to reopen on July 5, 2007, after the Department of Homeland Security sought to enforce the order of removal. The motion is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent contends that the time limit for filing her motion should be equitably tolled because she received ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent also contends that the Board should reopen proceedings sua sponte, or under section 240 (c)(7)(C)(iv) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229 (c)(7)(C)(iv). In support of her motion, the respondent has submitted a large number of documents, as well as two supplemental motions with evidence. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes reopening.
 
The respondent has substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (lst Cir. 1988). See Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741, 745-46 (4th Cir. 2006). The respondent contends that former counsel provided ineffective assistance at the hearing, on appeal, and failed to provide her notice of the Board’s decision. In support of her claims, the respondent’s current employer asserts that the respondent’s file did not include letters from former counsel regarding the pending appeal or the Board’s decision. The respondent also contends that she made payments after the Board dismissed the appeal, which supports her assertion that she did not have notice of the Board’s decision.
 
a review of the record does not indicate that the respondent’s former counsel provided ineffective assistance at either the hearing or on appeal. The fact that the respondent did not obtain relief, the denial of which was based on her own misrepresentations, does not mean that her former counsel was ineffective. Further, we agree with the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that the respondent’s former counsel did not provide ineffective assistance during her appeal because her former counsel contacted her during the pendency of her appeal, but she did not respond or pay her fees in accordance with his letter dated April 6, 2005. Moreover, after the Board issued its decision, the respondent’s former counsel mailed a copy of the decision to the respondent at her last known address. See Motion to Reopen, Exh. C, Letter dated July 24, 2005. The respondent’s assertions regarding lack of notice are given minimal weight, given that the Immigration Judge previously found that she misrepresented facts to obtain an immigration benefit, that she concealed information, and was not forthcoming (I.J. Dec. dated 5/21/04 at 3-4). The fact that the respondent did not provide copies of her former attorney’s letters to her current employer does not establish lack of notice. Similarly, making several payments of $100 to former counsel after the Board’s decision was issued does not necessarily establish that the respondent did not have notice of our decision. Further, the respondent failed to demonstrate that she exercised due diligence in seeking reopening. See Chao v. Virginia Department of Transportation, 291 F.3d 276, 283 (4th Cir. 2002)(equitable tolling is not available when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf). The Immigration Judge issued his decision in 2004, we summarily dismissed the appeal in 2005, and the respondent was provided with notice of our decision soon thereafter, but did not hire new counsel until after the DHS contacted her in 2007. Even if the respondent did not have notice of our decision, her assertions of due diligence are not plausible given the passage of time from the Immigration Judge’s decision to the filing of the instant motion, the Immigration Judge’s prior findings of misrepresentation, former counsel’s assertions that he attempted to contact the respondent during the pendency of the appeal, but the respondent did not respond to his telephone calls, and the follow-up letter from the respondent’s former counsel mailed during the pendency of the appeal. The respondent’s motion to reopen under section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv) is also denied because it is based on the same allegations and facts previously presented to, and rejected by, the Immigration Judge. We do not view section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv) as an opportunity for an illegal alien to relitigate the same issues previously presented and rejected. Further, the respondent’s current motion under section 240(C)(7)(C)(iv) is untimely, and a review of the record, including the motion to reopen, and supplements, do not provide sufficient evidence of extraordinary circumstances or extreme hardship to her children so as to justify an exception to the time-bar. We decline, moreover, to reopen sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999) (fundamental change in law may warrant sua sponte reopening notwithstanding otherwise applicable time and number limitations on motions); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997)(Board retains limited discretionary power under the regulations to reopen or reconsider only in exceptional circumstances).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied.

Summary dismissal was appropriate because the Notice of Appeal did not adequately notify the Board of the factual and legal reasons for the appeal as required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(b).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
June Zhou, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
James D. Paoli
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on December 29, 2005, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s March 30, 2005, denial of a motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia removal order issued on February 25, 2005.
 
On November 30, 2007, the respondent, a native and citizen of China, filed a motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order. Under section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances. The respondent acknowledges that his motion is untimely, but seeks equitable tolling of the 180-day deadline because his motion is premised on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his former attorney, Mr. Xu.
 
The respondent’s motion will be denied for two reasons. First, it is untimely filed. The respondent seeks equitable tolling of the 180-day motions deadline based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, has held that the deadline for motions to reopen deportation proceedings may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iavorski v. United States INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000). Aliens relying on equitable tolling must establish that (1) their constitutional right to due process was violated by counsel’s conduct; and (2) they exercised due diligence during the period sought to be tolled. Id.
 
We find that equitable tolling is not warranted in this case where the respondent has failed to exercise due diligence in pursing his case. The respondent’s prior motion to reopen, which was also premised on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, was denied two years ago because the respondent failed to comply with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Nor is this motion supported by evidence that he has complied with Lozada. He has simply failed to show that he exercised due diligence during the period sought to be tolled. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2nd Cir. 2006) (finding that aliens had demonstrated that their counsel was ineffective in informing them that they did not need to appear at a hearing, but they had not met their burden of showing why they had not been diligent over a two-year period).
 
*2 The respondent’s motion to reopen these removal proceedings will also be denied as number barred. Federal regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(D) provide an exception to the one-motion rule when a motion seeking to rescind an in absentia order is filed. However, that exception is limited to motions that are filed in deportation and exclusion proceedings. There is no equivalent exception in removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3) (providing an exception only to the time, but not to the numerical, restrictions on motions in removal proceedings); 1003.23(b)(4)(h), (iii)(D). Thus, unless another exception is shown to apply, the respondent’s second motion is number barred.
 
Based on the foregoing, the respondent’s motion is denied as time and number barred.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on January 27, 2004, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s denial of a prior motion to reopen. The instant motion, which was filed on November 23, 2007, is both time and number barred. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), only one motion to reopen (whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge) is permitted in deportation proceedings and the motion must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order. Assuming that the Fourth Circuit would recognize ineffective assistance as a basis for equitably tolling the restrictions on motions, the respondent’s motion makes no attempt to explain why she waited another three years after her last motion was denied to pursue her ineffective assistance of counsel claim against her former counsel.¿FN1 º Accordingly, we do not find an adequate basis to equitably toll the time and number restrictions on motions. Accordingly, the motion is denied as time and number barred.

We note that the respondent’s arguments related to eligibility for section 212(c) relief are not persuasive in any event because the charge based on commission of a crime involving moral turpitude was withdrawn, leaving as the sole charge of deportability the section 241 (a)(l)(D)(I) (termination of conditional permanent resident status) charge which does not have a statutory counterpart in section 212 of the Act.

APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent filed a “Motion to Reconsider” on November 23, 2007. The Board previously dismissed the respondent’s appeal on October 24, 2007, for lack of jurisdiction as his Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) was untimely filed on September 14, 2007, the Immigration Judge having rendered his decision orally on April 11, 2007. The respondent continues to argue in the pending motion, as he did on appeal, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in proceedings before the Immigration Court. Moreover, he continues to take issue with the Immigration Judge’s April 11, 2007, decision on a number of other bases. We noted in our October 24, 2007, decision that, if the respondent wished to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, the motion was to be filed with the Board. However, in challenging any other finding or seeking to reopen, the motion must be filed with the Immigration Court. In the current motion, no error with respect to the Board’s finding that his Notice of Appeal was untimely filed or our conclusion that we lacked jurisdiction in this matter, has been alleged by the respondent. There is no adequate basis to reconsider our decision dismissing the respondent’s September 14, 2007, appeal, filed more than 5 months after the Immigration Judge’s April 11, 2007, decision. The motion is, therefore, denied.

Jeffrey B. Rubin, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act

APPLICATION: Termination
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 27, 2007, finding the respondent removable, as charged, based on his record of conviction (Exh. 3), and determining that he was ineligible for relief from removal. While the respondent’s appeal was pending before the Board, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and remand this matter to the Immigration Court for further proceedings based on new, material, and previously unavailable evidence. The respondent’s request is premised on the claim that the conviction which forms the basis for the grounds of removal, has been vacated. Specifically, the respondent has presented evidence that on November 9, 2007, the New Bedford District Court, sitting in New Bedford, Massachusetts, granted the respondent’s Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and Vacate His Conviction¿FN1º on the basis of ineffective assistance of former counsel at his criminal trial, and continued the case for a new hearing on the respondent’s motion to suppress. We observe the respondent’s motion was properly served on the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), and the DHS has filed no opposition or other response to this motion, and the motion is deemed unopposed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3).
 
The Board in Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003), reversed on other grounds, Pickering v. Gonzales, 465 F.3d 263 (6th Cir.2006), held that if a court vacates a conviction based upon a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings, there is no longer a conviction for immigration purposes. However, an alien remains convicted of a removable offense when the predicate conviction is vacated simply for rehabilitative purposes or to aid the alien in avoiding adverse immigration consequences and not because of any procedural or substantive defect in the original conviction. Id. at 624; see also Saleh v. Gonzales, 495 F.3d 17, 25 (2d Cir. 2007) (joining and citing to the decisions of the various circuits in support of the Board’s decision in Pickering that if a court vacates an alien’s criminal conviction solely on the basis of immigration hardships or rehabilitation, rather than on the basis of a substantive or procedural defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the conviction is not eliminated for immigration purposes and will continue to serve as a valid factual predicate for a charge of removability despite its vacatur); see also Matter of Chavez-Martinez, 24 I&N Dec. 272 (BIA 2007) (alien’s conviction cannot be vacated solely for immigration purposes).
 
*2 In the matter before us, however, it is clear the criminal court judge’s ruling granting the respondent’s Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and Vacate His Conviction, was based on his finding the respondent’s former criminal counsel’s failure to move to suppress evidence at the respondent’s criminal trial constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Therefore, the court’s action was premised upon what it perceived to be a constitutional infirmity in the underlying proceedings, rather than some form of post-conviction relief. See Rumierz v. Gonzales, 456 F.3d 31, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2006) (a vacated conviction is no longer a “conviction” within the meaning of the immigration laws only “if a court with jurisdiction vacates ¿theº conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.”); Herrera-lnirio v. INS, 203 F.3d 299 (1st Cir. 2000).
 
The question here is whether there is now an aggravated felony conviction, or any conviction, rendering the respondent not only removable but also statutorily ineligible for relief, or whether the proceedings should be terminated. Consequently, in view of the foregoing and the lack of opposition by the DHS, the respondent’s motion will be granted, the record will be remanded to enable the Immigration Judge to consider the new evidence offered by the respondent relating to his removability under sections 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and(B)(i) of the Act, and to determine whether the respondent can now establish his eligibility for relief from removal, or whether the proceedings should be terminated.
 
Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and the entry of a new decision.

January 3, 2008
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
  
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Linda Osberg-Braun, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. By decision mailed August 7, 2007, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed in absentia, and thereafter on October 1, 2007, denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent has filed a timely Notice of Appeal from the latter decision. The matter will be remanded.
 
The respondent contends that he filed a change of address with the Department of Homeland Security prior to the initiation of these proceedings, and that the DHS thus erred in not sending the Notice to Appear to his new, correct address, an error repeated by the Immigration Court when it sent the notice for the August 7, 2007, hearing date. Alternatively, the respondent contends that his order of removal in absentia should be rescinded because his former counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to correct the address error, and in failing to enter an appearance with the Immigration Court, which would have resulted in counsel receiving the hearing notice.
 
We find the respondent’s first argument unavailing. He admits to having received the Notice to Appear (NTA), which was sent to his former address and forwarded to him by the Postal Service. At that point, he was on notice that the address on the NTA was defective, and he was under obligation, as clearly stated in the NTA, to notify the Immigration Court of his current address. His failure to do so, which resulted in the sending of the Notice of Hearing for August 7, 2007, cannot be excused under the law of the applicable Circuit nor of this Board. Dominguez v. United States Att’y Gen’l, 284 F.3d 1258 (11th Cir. 2002); Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001). The respondent’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are first presented on appeal, and their resolution will require findings of fact that are best resolved in the first instance by the Immigration Judge. The respondent has complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), with respect to Mr. Soto, his former counsel. While there is evidence that the respondent hired Mr. Soto to represent him in “deportation” proceedings, and while the respondent contends on appeal that he informed Mr. Soto of the initiation of these removal proceedings, there is no response as yet from Mr. Soto. The Immigration Judge on remand shall re-consider the respondent’s motion to reopen the in absentia order of removal in light of the new claims presented regarding alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed with respect to the issues presented in the respondent’s initial motion to reopen, and the proceedings are remanded for further consideration of that motion in light of the new allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel.

ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated August 17, 2005. On August 17, 2005, the Board affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s request for a continuance based on a pending application for labor certification, denied a motion to remand for adjustment of status based on the approval of the labor certification of the respondent’s wife on April 11, 2005, and reinstated a grant of voluntary departure. On October 28, 2005, we denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider our decision on the merits. A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. The respondent’s motion to reopen, filed on August 2, 2007, seeks reopening for consideration of adjustment of status and/or cancellation of removal and is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The motion is denied as untimely filed.
 
The respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). We find that under the facts alleged ineffective assistance of counsel has not been shown. In the complaint filed with the Texas Bar, the respondent asserts, inter alia, that his former attorney did not timely file an appeal of his case with this Board. However, the record reveals that the appeal was, in fact, timely filed. In the motion to reopen, the respondent contends that his former attorney should have filed a timely motion to reopen for consideration of cancellation of removal and/or adjustment of status. The only potential qualifying relative for cancellation of removal mentioned in the current motion is the respondent’s wife, who became a lawful permanent resident on March 9, 2006, more than 90 days after our August 17, 2005, decision. Consequently, the respondent could not have shown that he had prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal or adjustment of status so as to timely file a motion to reopen. Contrary to the respondent’s contentions, the Board itself and Immigration Judges are without authority to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel against the DHS so as to preclude it from undertaking a lawful course of action that it is empowered to pursue by statute and regulation. See Matter of Hernandez-Puente, 20 I&N Dec. 335, 338 (BIA 1991). Moreover, we also decline to reopen sua sponte. Simply acquiring additional equities after a final order of removal does not establish an exceptional situation that would support circumventing the regulations where enforcing them might result in hardship. The f£.ct that the respondent’s wife is now a lawful permanent resident and he is the beneficiary of a pending visa petition for derivative adjustment does not provide a basis for sua sponte reopening.See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied as untimely, and the request for a stay of removal is denied.

On November 30, 2007, the respondent submitted a supplement to his motion to reopen which we have considered on appeal. Although the respondent used the term “pro se” in this supplement, he did not indicate that he was no longer represented by Amen Omo Obas, Esquire, who submitted a Form EOIR-27 on September 27, 2007. Amen Omo Obas, Esquire, has not submitted a motion to withdraw as counsel. Consequently, we consider Amen Omo Obas as the attorney of record.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Howard Johnson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
J. Grant
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated April 3, 2007, denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), in the exercise of discretion. The Immigration Judge’s discretionary denial of cancellation of removal is affirmed pursuant to this Board’s authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5). This Board agrees with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is undeserving of a favorable exercise of discretion on his application for cancellation of removal as it does not appear in the best interests of the United States that the respondent be allowed to remain in this nation. See Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998); Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581 (BIA 1978).
 
The respondent’s contention on appeal that his former counsel rendered ineffective assistance at the hearing by failing to present the testimony of the respondent’s daughters as witnesses is without legal merit. Ineffective assistance of counsel in a removal proceedings is a denial of due process if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case. See Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1985). In any case presenting an ineffectiveness claim, the performance inquiry must be whether counsel’s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984). Methods of case presentation are within counsel’s professional judgment and are afforded great deference. See Strickland v. Washington, supra at 688-89. Strategic decisions, such as whether to call a particular witness at the hearing, rest upon the sound professional judgment of the lawyer, Gustave v. United States, 627 F.2d 901, 904 (9th Cir. 1980). Such appropriately informed strategic decisions are virtually unchallengeable. See Strickland v. Washington, supra at 690.
 
The assertion by respondent’s present counsel that the testimony of the respondent’s step-daughters should have been presented is not fact but opinion. On the contrary, the presentation of witness testimony also carries with it the right of cross-examination which may result in the identification of additional adverse information or reason to discount otherwise favorable information. Furthermore, the service of the respondent’s adult step-daughter in the armed services of the United States is of de minimis weight in assessing whether the respondent should be allowed to remain in this nation as her character is not at issue and is not a reflection upon the respondent’s character.
 
*2 The judgments of former counsel criticized by present counsel are the kind of strategic decisions that are virtually unchallengeable. This is not an instance where former counsel failed to meet a deadline or submit an application, nor is this an instance where former counsel did not reasonably prepare for the hearing or present any evidence on the respondent’s behalf. Rather, this is an instance where present counsel is second-guessing former counsel’s method of case presentation and strategic decisions, out of a belief, which this Board has little reason to believe is correct, that his own methods would have resulted in success. As such, in the absence of “egregious circumstances,” which have not been established in this matter, an alien is bound by the “reasonable tactical decisions of his counsel.” See Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938, 942 (BIA 1995), citing Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 383 (BIA 1986); see also Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 933-34 (9th Cir. 1986). The respondent was not prevented from reasonably presenting his case that he was deserving of a favorable exercise of discretion. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Margaret Wong, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Victoria Christian
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on December 29, 2003, because he failed to appear for a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on July 25, 2006, but the Immigration Judge denied it on October 2, 2006. This appeal followed. The appeal will be sustained.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel in these proceedings because his former counsel did not inform the Immigration Court of his change of address as promised, failed to notify the respondent of his hearing, and told him that his case remained pending with the Immigration Court while knowing that the respondent had been ordered removed from the United States in absentia. The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements for establishing attorney negligence and prior counsel has not responded to the allegation. See Matter ofLozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Hamid v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 465 (6th Cir. 2003).
 
The Sixth Circuit has not yet ruled on the issue of whether ineffective assistance of counsel warrants the equitable tolling of the time and number restrictions on motions. See Scorteanu v. INS, 339 F.3d 407 (6th Cir. 2003). However, the court has held that equitable tolling does not apply when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf. See Dunlap v. United States, 250 F.3d 1001, 1008 (6th Cir. 2001)(statute o flimitations may only be tolled where the circumstances are both beyond the petitioner’s control and unavoidable even with due diligence). In the instant case, the respondent was apprehended by immigration authorities in July 2006 and filed his request for reopening within that month (See respondent’s affidavit dated September 18, 2006, at paragraph #16). We therefore conclude that the respondent has pursued reopening with due diligence and therefore find that his motion was submitted timely.
 
The respondent has established based on the allegations set forth in his affidavit that prior counsel was negligent in his representation. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998) (requiring that counsel’s representation be egregious and it rendered the heating unfair). Apparently, prior counsel received the Notice of Hearing sent to him by the Immigration Court notwithstanding that he did not file a Notice of Appearance. He also was given an opportunity to respond to the serious allegation of negligence alleged by the respondent but has chosen not to. We find it appropriate to reopen these proceedings based on the respondent’s uncontested charges that set forth a prima case of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 In reaching our decision, we have considered that the DHS has opposed the reopening of these proceedings. According to the DHS, the respondent was responsible for his failure to appear for his heating because he did not stay in contact with his attorney or provide counsel and the Immigration Court with his current address. However, the respondent indicates in his affidavit that he moved to 4819 Prestwick Crossing, Westlake, Ohio 44145 in September 2002. He further indicates that he contacted his former attorney within a week to notify counsel of the change of address. The respondent states that counsel assured him that he would notify both the DHS and the Immigration Court of the change. The respondent further states in his affidavit that counsel continually informed him that everything was taken care of and the respondent would receive all required notices. In addition, the respondent indicates that he spoke with his former attorney on a few occasions in 2004 and in the beginning of 2005. Former counsel supposedly told the respondent in 2005 that he need not keep calling because he would tell the respondent when his heating would occur. We therefore cannot conclude that the respondent did not maintain contact with his former attorney. He also does not appear to be at fault for not submitting the required notice of his address change because his attorney had assured him that such was completed on his behalf. The respondent also appears to have been the victim of egregious attorney misconduct. Failing to notify the respondent of his hearing and informing the Immigration Court of the respondent’s address change constitutes negligence. The matter is compounded by former counsel’s supposed representation to the respondent that his case was pending for a hearing while knowing that the respondent had been ordered removed from the United States in absentia.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is sustained, these proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph C. Sekula, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact
 
Sec. 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I)º Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
 
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on October 3, 2006, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. In a prior decision dated December 22, 2004, we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal because he failed to file a brief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E) (2007). In denying his subsequent motion to reopen, we found that the respondent failed to establish that he was the subject of ineffective assistance of counsel such that his untimely request for reopening should be granted. The respondent did not comply with the procedural requirements for such a claim set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98, 106 (3d Cir. 2005), Furthermore, we found that the respondent had failed to establish that his former attorney’s actions caused him prejudice because the relief for which he sought reopening - a visa petition with which to obtain adjustment of status - was not available to him for three reasons: (1) the respondent is inadmissible for having failed to reveal that his mother, who had filed a visa petition on the respondent’s behalf, had passed away before the visa was issued; (2) the respondent failed to apply for a waiver of the ground of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i); and (3) the respondent failed to establish prima facie eligibility for relief by providing a sponsor if granted reinstatement of his visa petition. We also noted that both a waiver of inadmissibility and adjustment of status under section 212(i) and 245 of the Act, 8 U.s.c. §§ 1182(i), 1255, are discretionary and, therefore, in light of his fraud, not relief he would merit.
 
On June 1, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit granted the government’s unopposed motion to remand. That motion correctly noted that a lawful permanent resident is not viewed as seeking admission with. 6 exceptions.¿FN1º See section 101(a)(13)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 (a)(13)(C). The government’s motion asserts that the Notice to Appear lacks specificity in that it does not indicate which exception applies to the respondent. Although the respondent admits that he did not specifically raise this issue in his motion to reopen (Respondent’s Motion before the Third Circuit at 6-7), he argued that he was clearly prejudiced by his former attorney’s failure to argue that the factual allegations in the Notice to Appear do not support a finding of removability under section 212 of the Act.
 
*2 At the outset, we note that the respondent has apparently been removed from the United States (Respondent’s Br. Before the Third Circuit). We generally decline to render an opinion in such cases because our regulations specify that departure during the pendency of an appeal constitutes withdrawal of said appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.4; but see Chong v. District Direction, INS, 264 F.3d 378 (3d Cir. 2001) (holding that sufficient collateral consequences flowed from the Board’s order of removal that the case remained worthy of review despite the alien’s deportation). However, since the Circuit Court has mandated an answer to the questions raised in the government’s motion, we understand that mandate to govern this remand.
 
We find that the Notice to Appear alleges adequate facts with which to find the respondent removable as charged.¿FN2º In essence, the Notice alleges that the respondent never lawfully obtained permanent resident status because he obtained his status through fraud: he failed to reveal that his mother, who had filed a visa petition on his behalf, was deceased. Once fraud of this character is established, the respondent would not qualify as a lawful permanent resident relieved of the “admission” construct upon return from a trip abroad. See Matter of Koloamatangi, 23 I&N Dec. 548 (BIA 2003) (finding an alien who acquired permanent resident status through fraud or misrepresentation has never been “lawfully admitted for permanent residence” and was, therefore, ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)).
 
As before, we also decline to remand based on allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. In Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216 (BIA 2000), we stated that where an alien has filed an untimely motion to reopen alleging that the DHS failed to prove the alien’s removability, the burden of proof no longer lies with the DHS to establish removability, but shifts to the alien to demonstrate that an exceptional situation exists that warrants reopening by the Board on its own motion. It is not sufficient for the respondent to argue, as he did in his brief to the Third Circuit, that he could have provided explanations or defenses for the alleged fraud which might exculpate him. As we stated in Matter of Beckford, supra, “¿nºotwithstanding any possible problems with the Immigration Judge’s handling of the hearing or with the actions (or inaction) of previous counsel, the respondent, at a minimum, needed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood that the result in his case would be changed if reopening is granted.” ld. at 1219.
 
The respondent has not adequately shown that he was unaware that his mother was deceased at the time his visa was granted and that he had no role in obtaining the visa by fraud. And, even assuming that the respondent’s sister completed the paperwork for the adjustment of status application or that the visa application was not signed by the respondent, he was still not entitled to the visa or to the resident alien status it provided. Therefore, he was not entitled to this immigration benefit.
 
*3 Furthermore, the fact that he may have been qualified to seek other remedies is now irrelevant in that he was never entitled to the entry document he received. The possible relief for which he might have applied, including a waiver of inadmissibility, is discretionary and we have no way of knowing the outcome if the respondent had disclosed the truth and timely applied for such relief without pursuing his fraud. At this stage, the respondent’s attempts to remedy his fraud, or to excuse the improper receipt of permanent resident status, do not constitute exceptional circumstances which would warrant reopening on the basis of an untimely motion.¿FN3º
 
ORDER: The Board’s October 3, 2006, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen is affirmed.

Footnotes

1

We note that it is clear that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) became aware of the alleged fraud in the respondent’s and his siblings’ visa petition applications in 1999 and the agency intended not to grant their applications for lawful permanent residency. However, other evidence of record establishes that the respondent did adjust his status during that same year (Exh. 2). There is no evidence to establish that this status was ever rescinded.

2

We note the respondent’s argument before the Third Circuit that the DHS officer who issued the Notice to Appear failed to describe his title. According to the respondent, this, along with the fact that the Notice was served on the respondent a month after he attempted to enter, entitle the respondent to termination. However, the fact that the officer’s title was abbreviated as “II” or left off certain lines in the Notice to Appear is not a defect which warrants termination. As we stated in our previous order, at footnote 1, the regulations do not specify the format with which a title must be listed. See 8 C.F.R. § 239.1; see also Diaz-Soto v. INS, 797 F.2d 262 (5th Cir. 1986) (finding that the charging document need not require the actual signature of the Immigration and Naturalization Service official authorized to issue such documents). We decline to find, as suggested by the respondent, that the lack of title means the respondent would have been admitted as a lawful permanent resident because the DHS cannot meet its burden under the regulations.

3

In light of our decision, we decline to address the respondent’s arguments that our previous decision took on a formulaic view of the respondent’s ineffective assistance claims or that it ignored or confused the other issues raised (Respondent’s Br. Before the Third Circuit at 36-47). See Zheng v. Gonzales, supra, at 106 (noting that strict, formulaic view of motions alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, or those in which the alien fails to meet the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, are disfavored).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Borges, Judith A., Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 09, 2007. An alien in removal proceedings is accorded a statutory tight to counsel, but at his or her own expense, under sections 240(b)(4)(A) and 292 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Removal proceedings may be conducted, even though an alien does not have counsel, as long as 10 days have elapsed since service of the Notice to Appear. Section 239(b)(3) of the Act. On appeal, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in holding the heating when the respondent’s attorney failed to appear on his behalf. However, the record reveals that the respondent was provided with a list of organizations and attorneys which provide free legal services when he was served with the Notice to Appear on January 19, 2007. He was again provided with a list of attorneys who might represent him at little or no cost at the hearing on May 7, 2007 (Tr. at 3), and subsequently reminded that he could consult with tan attorney (Tr. at 46). The respondent indicated on more than one occasion that he had not obtained counsel, that he did not intend to obtain counsel (Tr. at 21), and that he intended to speak for or represent himself (Tr. at 6, 21). The record contains no entry of appearance before the Immigration Judge by any attorney. Moreover, at the heating on the merits on July 9, 2007, the respondent made no request for a continuance nor did he otherwise refer to having an attorney who failed to appear. Consequently, the respondent has not shown that there was any ineffective assistance of counsel. Although the respondent asserts that his constitutional tights have been violated, the Immigration Judge and the Board are not empowered to role on the constitutionality of the statutes and regulations under which we adjudicate. See Matter of C-, 20 I&N Dec. 529, 532 (BIA 1992); Matter of Valdovinos, 18 I&N Dec. 343 (BIA 1982).
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R § 1003.1 (d)(3)(1). Under this standard, the Board may not reverse an Immigration Judge’s factfinchng unless we determine that the Immigration Judge committed clear error. See Matter of SH-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002) (stating that the Board must defer to the factual determinations of an Immigration Judge in the absence of clear error). In this case, we find no clear error in the Immigration Judge’s factual findings. In addition, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s negative equities, including his criminal history, gang membership, and lack of stable employment, outweigh his positive equities including his lengthy residence in the United States and his extensive family ties. See Matter of OC-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998); Matter of Matin, 16 I&N Dec. 581 (BIA 1978). On appeal, the respondent argues, through counsel, that the Immigration Judge gave insufficient weight to his positive equities. We disagree. The Immigration Judge considered these factors, but concluded that the recency and seriousness of the respondent’s criminal activities indicated a lack of rehabilitation and outweighed his positive equities. The Immigration Judge’s conclusions were reasonable and we find no reason to overturn them. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

December 21, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nhu H. Muon, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on March 22, 2006, because he failed to appear for a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on December 4, 2006, but the Immigration Judge denied it on January 30, 2007. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that he was the victim of negligent advice provided to him by an individual purporting to be an attorney and such prevented him from attending his hearing. He argues that he established that his failure to appear was caused by an exceptional circumstance. The respondent indicates in his declaration that he received the Notice to Appear reflecting that his hearing would be held on May 2, 2006. He further indicates that he subsequently received the heating notice, and it indicated that his hearing would be held on March 22, 2006. According to the respondent, the non-attorney instructed him that the hearing date on the Notice to Appear controlled. He argues that he should not be penalized for relying on the incorrect advice given by an individual who he believed was an attorney. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision and his reliance on Singh-Bhathal v. INS, 170 F.3d 943 (9th Cir. 1999) (alien’s acceptance of advice of immigration consultant not to appear at deportation hearing does not constitute exceptional circumstance that would excuse his absence from hearing).
 
A claim alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy certain procedural requirements. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Among them is the requirement that the individual accused of negligence be informed of the allegation raised before the Immigration Court or the Board and allowed an opportunity to respond. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2003) (noting that the purpose of the notice requirement is to allow the prior counsel an opportunity to contest the allegations of ineffective assistance so that the adjudicator can more accurately assess the claim). Herein, the respondent filed a complaint against the non-attorney, but he has not provided the individual with an opportunity to reply to the allegation raised in these instant proceedings. Consequently, the Board and the Immigration Judge cannot assess the respondent’s accounts against the accounts of the non-attorney. We will not find that the respondent was the victim of attorney negligence under these circumstances. It follows that the respondent has not shown that exceptional circumstances prevented his appearance for his hearing. We therefore need not address whether the motion to reopen was timely filed.
 
*2 The respondent further argues on appeal that he was not adequately notified of the hearing because neither the charging document nor the hearing notice were written in Spanish. However, the respondent admits that he received both documents, and understood his obligation to appear for a hearing. He also states in his declaration that his failure to attend his hearing was caused by a non-attorney advising not to appear in Immigration Court on the date reflected on the Notice of Hearing. Clearly, the respondent’s failure to appear was not caused by the hearing notice not being written in Spanish. We therefore cannot find that the respondent had no notice of his hearing. There is also no requirement that notices be translated into the respondent’s native language. See generally Lopes v. Gonzales, 468 F.3d 81 (2nd Cir. 2006). This aspect of the appeal is dismissed.
 
Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed, and the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Antonio Salazar, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the December 4, 2006, decision of the Immigration Judge. The respondent’s removability under section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the “Act”) is not at issue on appeal. 8 U.S.C.§ 1182(a)6)(E)(i). The respondent does contends that she was entitled to the relief of cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act as a lawful permanent resident and that the Immigration Judge failed to properly balance the adverse factors of record against those favorable to her. The respondent also alleges that there were due process violations that tainted these proceedings. We find her claims to be without support in the record or legal merit. The denial of relief will be affirmed and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
We find that the Immigration Judge was thorough in his consideration of the record. We agree that the respondent’s equities include her long residence here; family ties and the presence of three United States citizen children;¿FN1º hardship; and her past employment history. However, these equities are outweighed by the unfavorable factors of record which include a criminal record for smuggling and prostitution, an earlier, undisclosed incident of smuggling as well as an adverse credibility finding which is amply supported by the record and undermines any claim she can show rehabilitation (I.J. at 17-19). We agree therefore in the denial of relief. To the extent she contends that the Immigration Judge employed a heightened standard of proof, this claim is without merit. Brief on Appeal at 32-33. Her application for relief was filed on June 13, 2006, or after May 11, 2005, so, her credibility as it related to meeting her burden of proof was properly judged under the REAL ID. Act of 2005.
 
The respondent separately challenges the result in her case on due process grounds. First, she asserts that the Immigration Judge was biased. Brief on Appeal at 21. She fails to point out when he was biased in these proceedings and nowhere does the record bear out her claim. Accordingly, we dismiss it. Secondly, she contends that the government failed to produce Exhibit 8, Form G-166 (Report of Investigation) and Exhibit 9, Form I-213 (Record of Deportable/ Inadmissible Alien), in a timely fashion and that its late submission prejudiced her ability to prepare her case and correctly recollect her prior statements at the time of her arrest for smuggling. The record indicates that these documents were offered by the government as rebuttal evidence, however, to impeach the respondent’s testimony. The Immigration Judge properly overruled the respondent’s objection to the introduction of these documents below (Tr. at 75). Moreover, while claiming prejudice, the respondent’s position on appeal is that notwithstanding the problems she faced preparing her case, the record and her equities “compel” a grant of this appeal. Brief on Appeal at 24. We therefore find she cannot establish prejudice since the late introduction of these documents did not preclude her from presenting her case, even if the government was required to present these documents at an earlier stage in the proceedings. We observe that the respondent is not contesting any of the information contained in exhibits 8 and 9; she simply wishes that had she remembered what she told the officer at the time, she would have testified consistent with those statements at her hearing. Brief on Appeal at 12, 18. Because she is not contesting the truth of the information contained in these exhibits, we find no support for her assertions now that the documents should have been authenticated or certified, too.
 
*2 Lastly, the respondent indirectly claims that she was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of her prior counsel. See Brief on Appeal at 18, fn. 2 and 24. She believes her in-court testimony in particular would have been better prepared, the Immigration Judge would not have concluded she lacked credibility, and her equities generally would have been better presented. Yet, none of the requirements for properly asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), have been met. Additionally, the respondent has not shown, as with her other due process claims, that she was actually prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 2002). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
The appeal is dismissed.

Some contention is made on appeal that the respondent’s parents and siblings should have been considered in this application for relief. However, the respondent, who has the burden of proof in this application, chose not to present supporting evidence from her family members because she did not want them to know she was in removal proceedings (I.J. at 10). See also Tr. at 42-43.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Keili M. Reynolds, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; remand
 
In a decision dated February 13, 2006, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The respondent has appealed. During the pendency of her appeal the respondent filed a motion to reopen, which we will treat as a motion to remand. The appeal will be dismissed, and the motion granted.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nicaragua, was convicted on January 5, 1995, in the Municipal Court of Los Angeles, Van Nuys Judicial District, State of California, for the offense of petty theft in violation of section 490.1 of the California Penal Code. (Exhs. 2, 4). The respondent was also convicted on April 20, 1999, in the Municipal Court of Los Angeles, Van Nuys Judicial District, State of California, for the offense of theft of property in violation of 484(a) of the California Penal Code. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent, who was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1994, could not demonstrate 7 years continuous residence necessary for cancellation of removal because her theft conviction in 1999 triggered the “stop time” rule and ended the respondent’s period of continuous physical presence. See section 240A(d)(l) of the Act.
 
On appeal, the respondent asserts that she is eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A of the Act under the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, decisions in Lepe-Guitron v. INS, 16 F.3d 1021 (9th Cir. 1994), and Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2005). Specifically, the respondent argues that because her father became a lawful permanent resident in 1989 that she should be able to impute his 7 years of lawful permanent residence status (Respondent’s Brief at 3).
 
In Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2005), the Ninth Circuit decided to extend its decision in Lepe-Guitron v. INS, supra, finding that “for purposes of satisfying the seven-years of continuous residence ‘after having been admitted in any status’ required for cancellation of removal…., a parent’s admission for permanent residence status is imputed to the parent’s unemancipated minor children residing with the parent.” Id. at 1029. In that case, the alien had entered the United States with his parents in 1985 and his mother attained lawful permanent residence in 1990, when he was 7 years old. Id. at 1016. The alien in that case obtained his lawful residency on December 4, 1997, when he was 14 years old. Id. Subsequently, on October 16, 2002, the alien was convicted of a burglary offense and was placed into removal proceedings. Id. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the alien in Cuevas- Gaspar had established the 7 years continuous residence for purposes of section 240A of the Act because he could “tack on” the approximately 7 years of his mother’s permanent residency prior to his own, namely 1990 through December 4, 1997. Thus, despite the fact that the alien ceased accumulating continuous residence sometime in 2002 at which time he had only acquired approximately 4 years in his own right, he had accumulated 7 years continuous residence when “tacking on” that of his mother when he was an “unemancipated minor.” Id.
 
*2 Cuevas-Gaspar and Lepe-Guitron allows for the imputation of the parents’ permanent residency to the child based upon the child’s status as an “unemancipated minor,” (emphasis added). Here, the respondent was admitted to the United States in 1994 as a lawful permanent resident on May 23, 1994, when she was approximately 17 1/2 years old. At most, the respondent would be able to impute less than 6 months of her father’s lawful permanent residency before she turned 18 and no longer qualified as an “unemancipated minor child residing with the parent.” Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, supra. We do not view the rationale in these cases to allow the respondent to accumulate her period of permanent residency for a time in which she was not residing with a lawful permanent parent as an “unemancipated minor.”As a result, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent is ineligible for cancellation of removal.
 
We next turn to the respondent’s motion to remand seeking an opportunity to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act. The respondent contends that because of the ineffective assistance of her prior counsel she did not apply for this form of relief, although she was eligible for such a waiver. At the outset, we find that the respondent has complied with the technical requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In addition, “substantial prejudice” must be shown; such prejudice means that the alleged ineffectiveness affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir. 2000). Based upon the record before us, it appears that the respondent may be eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, and that competent counsel should have applied for such a waiver. Accordingly, we will grant the motion and remand for consideration of the respondent’s eligibility for a waiver under section 212(h) of the Act.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is granted and the record remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
CERTIFICATION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Charles H. Kuck, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Arthur S. Raznick
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On November 21,2005, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States in absentia because she failed to appear for her hearing. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on December 12, 2005, but that request was denied on January 27, 2006. The respondent filed a timely appeal from this decision. On August 8, 2006, the Board remanded the record to the Immigration Court to address with specificity the respondent’s argument that her good faith confusion regarding the time of her hearing combined with the alleged negligence of her former counsel constitutes an “exceptional circumstance” to excuse her failure to appear. After considering this argument, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen on September 25, 2006, and certified the record back to the Board. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he or she did not receive proper notice of the time and place of the hearing, or because he or she was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of his or her own. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act. In this case, the only issue is whether the respondent failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances.
 
In her motion to reopen, the respondent explained that she did not appear for her hearing because she mistakenly believed that it was scheduled for November 21, 2005, at 4:30 p.m., rather than at 8:30 a.m. She reported discussing her case with her former attorney the month before the hearing, and advised him that she was relocating to Georgia but would return for the 4:30 p.m. hearing. Although the respondent mentioned the incorrect time for the hearing, her prior counsel did not correct her misunderstanding. The respondent received a telephone call from her former attorney when she arrived at the airport in Phoenix, Arizona at approximately 10:00 a.m. on the day of the hearing, and he asked why she failed to appear. After explaining that an order of removal had been issued in absentia, the respondent’s prior counsel instructed her to drive directly to the courthouse because he planned to advise the Immigration Judge that there was a misunderstanding about the time of the hearing and that she was on her way. According to the respondent, he called her approximately a half an hour later to instruct her to drive to his office. When the respondent’s husband asked whether they could go to the courthouse to explain that they were late for the hearing due to “an honest mistake,” her former attorney explained that all of the hearings for the rest of the day had been canceled and the court was closed because a court employee was having a baby. The respondent maintains that her prior counsel exercised poor judgment when he advised her to drive to his office rather than the courthouse because she could have arrived less than 2 hours late and explained her tardiness. Further, she argues that her former attorney was negligent in failing to file her application for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c).
 
*2 The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent failed to establish exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear at the hearing on November 21, 2005, based on her confusion regarding the scheduled time. See Valencia-Fragoso v. INS, 321 F.3d 1204 (9th Cir. 2003) (alien’s alleged misunderstanding of time of hearing did not constitute exceptional circumstances justifying reopening). Although the respondent submitted evidence showing that she complied with the requirements enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), she failed to establish that she suffered any prejudice due to her former counsel’s actions. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9thCir. 2004); Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241,1246 (9th Cir. 2000). Compliance with the procedural aspects of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel alone is not sufficient to warrant reopening. To prove a Fifth Amendment due process violation, the respondent must show both error from the ineffective assistance of counsel, and that she suffered prejudice as a result of that error. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent was notified of the date and time of her hearing, and she was responsible for ensuring her attendance. The fact that her prior counsel failed to correct her when she misstated the time of her hearing does not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel because the respondent has not shown that she was incapable of recording the proper time and making the necessary arrangements to appear at her hearing, or that her former attorney was obligated to verify that she recalled the information correctly. While the respondent suggests that her prior counsel erred in directing her to come to his office instead of the courthouse, she acknowledged that these instructions were given approximately 30 minutes after he advised her to drive directly to the courthouse and that he subsequently explained that the court was closed before she could arrive. Although the respondent argues that her prior attorney committed error when he failed to seek a section 212(c) waiver of inadmissibility, the Immigration Judge explained that the respondent’s former counsel was prepared to present arguments in support of this form of relief at the November 21, 2005, hearing. Consequently, we conclude that the respondent has not shown prejudice flowing from the alleged errors. We find that based upon the evidence of record, the respondent has not met the burden of demonstrating exceptional circumstances under the statute. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Swaray Conteh, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Alexandra Kostich
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º Convicted of aggravated felony (as defined in section 101 (a)(43)(A))
  
APPLICATION: Waiver under section 212(c)
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Trinidad and Tobago and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s September 1, 2006, decision, denying the respondent’s application for a waiver of removal under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). For the reasons set out below, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
We affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge with the following additions. Because the aggravated felony ground of removal applicable in this case, i.e., “sexual abuse of a minor” under section 101(a)(43)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(A),¿FN1º has no statutory counterpart in the grounds of inadmissibility under section 212(a) of the Act, the respondent is not statutorily eligible to apply for a section 212(c) waiver. Matter of Blake, 23 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 2005); see also Matter of Valere, 473 F.3d 757, 761-62 (7th Cir. 2007) (finding that alien’s crime of indecent assault of a minor, “like Blake’s crime of sexual abuse of a minor-had no statutory counterpart in § 212(a) at the time ¿the alienº pleaded guilty …. and application of Blake … was not impermissibly retroactive).
 
On appeal, the respondent alleges that his case is distinguishable from Blake, supra, and Valere, supra, because his guilty plea was entered prior to enactment of the Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, § 511 (a), 104 Stat. 4978, 5052 (“IMMACT”), which rendered aliens ineligible for section 212(c) relief who had been convicted of an aggravated felony and who served a prison term of at least 5 years. In support of this distinction, the respondent cites Toia v. Fasano, 334 F.3d 917 (9th Cir. 2003), wherein the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the IMMACT bar does not apply to aliens who pleaded guilty prior to enactment of IMMACT. However, we find Toia, supra, inapposite, for the following reasons: (a) unlike Toia, supra, here, the Immigration Judge did not bar the respondent from seeking a section 212(e) waiver based on IMMACT; (b) the record does not indicate that the respondent served a prison term of at least 5 years; and (c) Toia, supra, does not provide any relief for the respondent, as he was otherwise ineligible for a section 212(c) waiver at the time he pleaded guilty for the reasons set forth above. See Toia, supra, at 921 (stating that aliens who pleaded guilty prior to enactment of IMMACT may still apply for a section 212(c) waiver if they are otherwise eligible for such relief).
 
*2 The respondent also raises issues relating to the validity of his underlying criminal conviction, including allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. Even if we were to accept the respondent’s allegations, neither the Immigration Judge nor the Board can entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction, unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to examine an alien’s claims regarding his guilt or innocence. See Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1034 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). In other words, we are bound by the conviction records and have no authority to retry the respondent’s criminal case. Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(l) º - Crime involving moral turpitude (withdrawn)
 
Lodged: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Termination; cancellation of removal
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s July 17, 2007, decision ordering her removed from the United States to Brazil as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. The appeal will be sustained and the removal proceedings will be terminated.
 
The respondent is a native of Taiwan, a citizen of Taiwan and Brazil, and a lawful permanent resident of the United States. On December 7, 2004, she was convicted in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia of unlawfully attempting to remove a child from the United States with the intent to obstruct the lawful exercise of the parental rights of another in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1204(a), the international parental kidnapping statute. As a result of this conviction, the respondent was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 33 months.¿FN1º
 
On the basis of the aforementioned conviction, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent is deportable from the United States pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (2000), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony; to wit, an offense relating to “obstruction of justice” for which the term of imprisonment is at least 1 year. Section 101(a)(43)(S) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(S). In support of that determination, the Immigration Judge observed that because “parental rights” are defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1204(b)(2) as arising “by operation of law, court order, or legally binding agreement of the parties,” it necessarily follows that “¿oºbstructing parental rights ¿in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1204(a)º obstructs justice of the Court.”
 
Whether the respondent’s offense of conviction qualifies as an “aggravated felony” under section 101(a)(43)(S) of the Act is a legal issue that this Board reviews de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2007).¿FN2º In determining whether an offense constitutes an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(S) of the Act, this Board considers that the obstruction of justice offenses listed in 18 U.S.C. §§ 1501-1518 provide “substantial guidance.., as to the contours of the ‘obstruction of justice’ category of offenses.” Matter of Espinoza, 22 I&N Dec. 889, 892, 894 n.4 (BIA 1999) (holding that misprision of a felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 4 does not qualify as an offense “relating to obstruction ofjustice” within the meaning of section 101(a)(43)(S)). In general, those offenses “have as an element interference with the proceedings of a tribunal or require an intent to harm or retaliate against others who cooperate in the process of justice or might otherwise so cooperate.” Id. at 892. As we have explained, moreover, “we do not believe that every offense that, by its nature, would tend to ‘obstruct justice’ is an offense that should properly be classified as ‘obstruction of justice”’ under section 101(a)(43)(S). Id. at 893-94. On the contrary, “¿tºo include all offenses that have a tendency to, or by their nature do, obstruct justice would cast the net too widely.” Id. at 894. With these principles in mind, we turn to the facts of the present case.
 
*2 When the respondent committed her offense the statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. § 1204, provided as follows, in pertinent part:
  
§ 1204. International parental kidnapping
 
(a) Whoever removes a child from the United States, or attempts to do so, or retains a child (who has been in the United States) outside the United States with intent to obstruct the lawful exercise of parental rights shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 3 years, or both.
 
(b) As used in this section—
(1) the term “child” means a person who has not attained the age of 16 years; and
 
(2) the term “parental rights”, with respect to a child, means the right to physical custody of the child—
 
(A) whether joint or sole (and includes visiting rights); and
 
(B) whether arising by operation of law, court order, or legally binding agreement of the parties.
 
 
We conclude that this offense does not qualify as one “relating to obstruction of justice” within the meaning of Matter of Espinoza, supra. Specifically, although the offense is obviously a very serious one, it is not defined by reference to elements requiring interference with the proceedings of a tribunal or the official duties of a law enforcement officer, nor does conviction for the offense require proof that the accused harmed or threatened a person who would otherwise have cooperated in the process ofjustice. And although the definition of “parental rights” at 18 U.S.C. § 1204(b)(2)(B) does make reference to rights of physical custody arising “by operation of law, court order, or legally binding agreement,” this is insufficient in our view to establish that the act of kidnapping necessarily “obstructs justice” in any meaningful sense. Specifically, a parent’s right to physical custody of his or her child need not be determined by a court or administrative tribunal in order to exist “by operation of law.” In New York, for example, a biological parent enjoys a presumptive right to physical custody of his or her children “by operation of law,” unless and until that right is legally terminated. See, e.g., In re Michael B., 80 N.Y.2d 299, 309 (N.Y. 1992). Consequently, an individual who intends to obstruct the “parental rights” of another within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1204(a) does not necessarily intend to thereby disregard or frustrate the execution of any legal order or process.
 
The Immigration Judge’s characterization of the respondent’s offense as one “relating to obstruction of justice” is not without some legal support. We note, for example, that persons convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1204(a) are sentenced pursuant to the federal “obstruction of justice” sentencing guideline. U.S.S.G. § 2J1.2. Furthermore, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held that a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1204(a) warranted imposition of a three-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2J1.2(b)(2) for “substantial interference with the administration of justice” because “¿aºlthough the abduction did not interfere with an ongoing proceeding, ¿itº prevented proper legal proceedings from occurring by taking matters completely outside the purview of the administration of justice.” United States v. Amer, 110 F.3d 873, 885 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 904 (1997). Yet in our view such considerations merely reflect that particular violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1204(a) may “have a tendency to … obstruct justice”; they do not serve to establish that attempted international parental kidnapping can reasonably be considered an “offense relating to obstruction of justice” within the meaning of section 101(a)(43)(S).
 
*3 In light of the foregoing, we will reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision sustaining the aggravated felony charge against the respondent. In view of the fact that the Department of Homeland Security has not charged the respondent with deportability under any alternative ground, moreover, we will also terminate the removal proceedings.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained and the removal proceedings are terminated.

On June 12, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit vacated the respondent’s original 33-month sentence and remanded the matter to the District Court for resentencing and to allow the respondent to pursue a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by means of a petition for habeas corpus. United States v. Bokel, 185 Fed. Appx. 234 (4th Cir. 2006). On August 14, 2006, the District Court re-sentenced the respondent, and once again imposed a 33-month term of imprisonment. See Bokel v. United States, 2007 WL 1052482, at *2, *8 n.9 (W.D. Va. April 4, 2007) (slip opinion). Furthermore, the respondent’s habeas petition was denied by the District Court for insufficient evidence, id., and the respondent’s appeal from that denial has now been dismissed by the Fourth Circuit. United States v. Bokel, 2007 WL 2666794 (4th Cir., September 7, 2007).

We reach the merits despite the fact that the respondent’s handwritten notice of appeal contains a much less explicit challenge to the aggravated felony charge than she advanced before the Immigration Judge. The respondent is pro se on appeal and has attempted to articulate her full legal history to us as she understands it. Under the circumstances, we do not hold her to the same standards of clarity that we would require from a seasoned legal practitioner.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher J. Slender, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Donald W. Pearcy
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration and Reopening
 
This case was last before the Board on November 15, 2002, when we returned the record to the Immigration Court without further action because the respondent withdrew his appeal from the Immigration Judge’s May 21, 2002, decision finding the respondent ineligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), and ordering him removed from the United States as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. The respondent now appeals from the Immigration Judge’s January 16, 2007, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider and reopen proceedings based upon ineffective assistance of counsel and an intervening change in the law. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
As an initial matter, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion to reconsider and reopen was untimely.¿FN1º 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23.
 
In 2001, the respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, and a lawful permanent resident, was convicted of unlawfully taking and driving a vehicle in violation of section 10851(a) of the California Vehicle Code and was sentenced to a 365 day term of imprisonment. Even assuming for the sake of discussion that the respondent’s motion had been timely filed, we conclude the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider because in 2002 she correctly relied upon Matter of V-Z-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 1338 (BIA 2000) (holding that the offense defined by section 10851(a) of the California Vehicle Code qualifies categorically as a “theft offense” under section 101 (a)(43)(G) of the Act). In other words, the respondent’s untimely motion before the Immigration Judge presented no legal argument, change of law, or overlooked argument or aspect of the case that would establish that, based on the law as it existed in 2002, the Immigration Judge erred in her prior conclusion. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57 (BIA 2006).
 
The respondent contends that he is eligible for equitable tolling because his previous counsel withdrew his appeal from the Immigration Judge’s May 21, 2002, decision and the respondent alleges he did not learn of the former counsel’s actions and ineffective representation until 2006. Respondent’s Brief at 2. We conclude that the respondent did not act with due diligence because he failed to demonstrate a steadfast pursuit of his case throughout proceedings before the agency. Cf. Ghahremani v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 993 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding due diligence where alien was steadfast in pursuit of relief, including continual investigation and hiring two other attorneys, in unbroken efforts to retain competent counsel and file motion to reopen). Rather, the respondent delayed contacting current counsel to inquire about the status of his case until 2005, nearly 3 years after his previous counsel filed his appeal. In addition, the respondent has failed to adequately explain why he failed to investigate and pursue relief from removal during this time period.
 
*2 In the alternative, even if the respondent established due diligence, we cannot say that the previous counsel’s act of withdrawing the respondent’s appeal constituted ineffective assistance, given the state of the law at the time the appeal was withdrawn in 2002. See Matter of V-Z-S-, supra. We also note that the respondent has not complied with all of the procedural requirements for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and the record does not show a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582, 5587-88 (9th Cir. 2006), and the cases cited therein.
 
The rationale in the Penuliar case cited by the respondent has been repudiated by the United States Supreme Court in Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez. See Penuliar v. Ashcroft, 395 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir. 2005), petition for reh’g denied, 435 F.3d 961 (9th Cir. 2006); Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 127 S. Ct. 815 (2007). Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit’s decision in United States v. Vidal, 504 F.3d 1072 (9th Cir. 2007) does not provide the respondent with plausible grounds for relief, since the respondent was not convicted under section 10851 (a) as an accessory after the fact. Rather, the respondent plead guilty to driving a motor vehicle and knowing it was stolen, which reflects that the respondent was convicted as a principal. Exhibit 2. The respondent, therefore, stands convicted of an aggravated felony, and his argument on appeal is foreclosed by Duenas-Alvarez, supra. Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER; The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mario Acosta, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
 
CHARGE:
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 13, 2007, denying the respondent!s motion to reopen. An Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent deported in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on November 14, 1996. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge found that there was no good cause to toll the 180-day deadline for the entirety of the 10 year period that elapsed since the respondent received the Immigration Court’s in absentia order of deportation. He also determined that even if timely, the respondent failed to establish exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. Specifically, the Immigration Judge found that pursuant to the holding of the Ninth Circuit in Singh-Bhathal v. INS, 170 F.3d 943 (9th Cir, 1999), the respondcnt’s voluntary choice to follow the advice of an immigration consultant instead of the notice of bearing issued by the Immigration Court is not an exceptional circumstance. The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s request for sua sponte reopening.
 
On appeal, the respondent contends that he has established exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear for the hearing on November 14, 1996, due to ineffective assistance of counsel. He also asserts that he was prejudiced by the actions of the immigration consultant that assisted him, and that he exercised due diligence in seeking to reopen his deportation proceedings.
 
We find that the respondent has established ineffective assistance of counsel, as he relied on the advice of an immigration consultant who falsely represented herself to be a lawyer, that it was not necessary for him to appear for his hearing. See Monjaraz-Munoz, 327 F.3d 892 (9th Cir. 2003) (if an alien fails to appear because of his actual and reasonable reliance on counsel’s erroneous advice, it can constitute a circumstance beyond the alien’s control); see also Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999)(the statute of limitations to reopen an order of deportation is equitably tolled where the alien’s late petition is the result of deceptive actions by a representative); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
However, we find that the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondent’s motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel was filed untimely, even if equitable tolling is taken into consideration. See I.J. Dec. dated April 12, 2007. In Fajardo v. INS, 300 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2002), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the limitation period on motions to reopen based on exceptional circumstances must be tolled until the alien was aware of the harm resulting from his two former attorney’s misconduct. While equitable tolling is available for untimely motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in pursing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See e.g. RodriguezLariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir.); Socop-Gonzalez, 272 F.3d 1176; Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). As noted by the Immigration Judge, according to the respondent’s own declaration, he received the in absentia deportation order in November 1996, and by January 1997, the respondent was fully aware that Ms. Dorantes had defrauded him because he learned that she was being investigated by authorities, and that criminal charges had been brought against her. See Respondcnt’s Declaration, dated March 1, 2007. The respondent claims that since March 1997, he has consulted with three different attorneys, all of whom informed him that he did not have a case and he would not be able to reopen his proceedings. However, the respondent states that prior to meeting with his current counsel in August 2006, he last met with an attorney in late 2003. In his declaration, the respondent avers that if he had known there was something he could do, such as filing a motion, he would have done it in a beartbeat because he wanted to have a meaningful day in court.
 
*2 The respondent has failed to establish that he acted with due diligence required for equitable tolling. The respondent concedes that in November 1996, he received the in absentia order of deportation from the Los Angeles Immigration Court. The respondent was informed that the Immigration Judge’s decision was final unless a motion to reopen is filed with the Immigration Court in accordance with Section 242B(c)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252B(c)(3), and the respondent was provided with the address of the Los Angeles Immigration Court. Yet the respondent never inquired with the Immigration Court after receiving the in absentia order of deportation in November 1996, to pursue reopening through filing a motion to reopen with the court. Moreover, the respondent did not seek out any counsel regarding his in absentia order of deportation from late 2003 until August 2006, at which time he met with current counsel. Even if we accept that prior counsel was ineffective and failed to advise the respondent that he was required to attand the hearing on November 14, 1996, the respondcnt’s assertions of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be overcome by the lack of respondcnt’s due diligence in pursuing his case. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)º -Fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact (AXX XXX XXX & AXX XXX XXX)

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondents, natives and citizens of Georgia, have timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s September 24, 2007, decision. The respondents contend that the Immigration Judge erred in denying their untimely motion to reopen. The respondents request that we stay their removal from the United States. The stay request will be denied and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
We adopt the procedural history set forth in the Immigration Judge’s September 24, 2007, decision. As set forth in the Immigration Judge’s order, in addition to the respondents’ most recent motion to reopen, the respondents previously filed two other motions to reopen. Inasmuch as the respondents are limited, with certain exceptions, to filing one motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondents’ motion is number-barred and should be denied on that basis. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
The respondents also contend that the proceedings should be reopened because of their prior counsel’s ineffective assistance. The respondents contend that they have complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998). In Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639, we held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the claim reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. However, as set forth in the Immigration Judge’s order, the respondents failed to submit an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with their prior counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondents in this regard. Inasmuch as the respondents failed to include an affidavit as required, we agree with the Immigration Judge that they failed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 Lastly, the respondents argue that proceedings should be reopened so that the lead respondent may apply for asylum due to his lengthy absence from Georgia and involuntary renunciation of his Georgian citizenship. However, the regulations concerning motions to reopen before an Immigration Judge only waive the time and numerical limitations for motions to reopen based on “changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality” not personal circumstances as described in the respondents’ motion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i). Based on the foregoing, we find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondents’ motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondents’ request for a stay of removal is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se¿FN1º
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On September 19, 2007, the respondent filed this motion to reopen our February 12, 1988, decision dismissing his appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(e)(2), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days atter the date of that decision, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. In the instant case, the respondent’s motion to reopen would have been due on or before September 30, 1996. Hence, the respondent filed this motion to reopen out of time. We will deny the untimely motion to reopen.
 
This case was last before the Board on June 3, 1993, when we denied a previous motion to reopen in which the respondent sought of voluntary departure, or, in the alternative, reopening to apply for suspension of deportation. The previous motion to reopen was premised on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during the deportation proceedings. The instant motion is, in substance, virtually identical to the previous motion, except that the respondent now requests reopening to enable him to apply for adjustment of status based on an approved visa petition (Form I-360).
 
Initially, we note that while the respondent reiterates the very same ineffective assistance of counsel claim put froth in the previous motion, he has put forth neither arguments nor evidence to account for the untimeliness of the instant motion. The Board, however, retains limited discretionary power to reopen proceedings sua sponte under 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(a). See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (discussing the Board’s limited authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte). Nevertheless, for the following reasons, we refrain from exercising that power in this case.
 
First, the Board has already considered and rejected the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. On November 1, 1983, an Immigration Judge found the respondent deportable as charged, but granted him the privilege of voluntary departure with an alternative order of deportation to Korea. The respondent did not appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision. However, the respondent failed to depart the United States on or before March 1, 1984, pursuant to the grant of voluntary departure, and he failed to present himself for deportation on October 10, 1985, pursuant to a “bag and baggage” letter from the former Immigration and Naturalization Service. In the instant motion to reopen, as in the previous motion to reopen, the respondent claims that he unknowingly failed to depart the United States as required due to ineffective assistance of counsel. In our previous decision, we rejected that claim as frivolous and dilatory. Now, more than 14 years after our June 3, 1993, decision, the respondent reiterates the same ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the instant motion. As a motion to reopen is not an opportunity to repeat previously considered and rejected arguments, we will not revisit the ineffective assistance of counsel claim at this time. See INS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450 U.S. 139, 141 (1981) (discussing motions to reopen); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N 399, 402 (BIA 1991).
 
*2 Second, this case does not warrant reopening sua sponte to enable the respondent to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). See Matter of J-J-, supra. The respondent failed to comply with the terms of a grant of voluntary departure, and he has been subject to a final deportation order entered on March 1, 1984. He failed to present himself for deportation on October 10, 1985, pursuant to a “bag and baggage letter,” and he has remained in the United States in violation of immigration laws for more than 23 years, during which time he abused the immigration process by filing frivolous motions before the Immigration Judge and the Board. Regardless of statutory eligibility for adjustment of status, accrued equities, or potential hardship, the respondent, who has shown utter disregard for the immigration laws of the United States, does not merit a favorable exercise of discretion. See Giri v. Keisler, 2007 WL 3276110 (5th Cir. 2007) (extending the fugitive disentitlement doctrine, which limits a criminal defendant’s access to the judicial system whose authority he evades, to the immigration context where the petitioners are fugitive aliens who have evaded custody and failed to comply with a removal order); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 257 (BIA 1985) (finding that an alien in immigration proceedings who fails to report for deportation does not merit the favorable exercise of discretion required for reopening). Accordingly, the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of deportation is denied.
 
The following order will be entered.

With the motion, the respondent submitted a Form EOIR-28 (Notice of Entry of Appearance or Representative Before the Immigration Court) signed by Mafia L. Saucedo, Esquire. However, Attorney Saucedo has not filed a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney before the Board (Form EOIR-27) as required by the regulations. The respondent is therefore considered to be proceeding pro se. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(1).

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, is a lawful permanent resident of the United States. As a result of his October 24, 1991, conviction for manslaughter in the first degree, for which he was sentenced to 7 to 21 years’ incarceration, he was placed in deportation proceedings. By a decision dated July 20, 1995, an Immigration Judge found the respondent to be deportable as charged, found he had abandoned his application for a waiver pursuant to section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), and ordered him to be deported to the Dominican Republic. The respondent did not file a timely appeal. Subsequently, on April 25, 2005, the respondent filed a special motion with the Immigration Judge, again seeking a waiver pursuant to section 212(c) of the Act in light of INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001). On June 8, 2005, the Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding the respondent to be statutorily ineligible for that relief. By a decision dated September 29, 2005, this Board affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision of June 8, 2005. Thereafter the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board on November 28, 2005, contending that prior counsel had provided ineffective assistance. The Board denied the motion on February 13, 2006, finding that the respondent had failed to comply with the requirements for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
On March 8, 2007, the record was remanded from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. While finding that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen with regard to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the court noted that the Board had not addressed the respondent’s contention in the addendum to his motion dated January 14, 2006, that the Immigration Judge improperly considered statements of a corrections officer and consequently ordered the respondent deported for failure to attend his deportation heating.¿FN1º
 
It is the respondent’s contention that the Immigration Judge improperly considered statements of a corrections officer at the facility at which the respondent was incarcerated, to the effect that the respondent refused to attend his deportation hearing because the respondent had not been permitted to shower before the hearing. The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in determining that the respondent had abandoned his claim for failure to attend his hearing. It is the respondent’s contention that his case should be remanded to the Immigration Judge for consideration of his application for section 212(c) relief.
 
*2 The respondent’s hearing on his application for section 212(c) relief was scheduled to be held on July 20, 1995, at the facility at which he was incarcerated. The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent failed to appear and that the Immigration Judge had been advised by a corrections officer at the facility that the respondent refused to appear unless he were permitted to take a shower first, which privilege had apparently been denied to him by the prison authorities. The Immigration Judge then proceeded to deem the respondent’s application for relief abandoned (Tr. 61-71). The respondent was represented by counsel at the July 20, 1995, hearing, and on July 27, 1995, counsel was provided with a July 20, 1995, letter from the corrections officer describing the respondent’s refusal to attend the hearing.
 
Motions to reopen proceedings are disfavored and this Board has “broad discretion” to grant or deny such motions. INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 322-23 (1992); INS v. Rios-Pineda, 471 U.S. 444, 449-50 (1985). Thus, a motion to reopen under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) will not be granted unless the movant establishes a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). Even if a prima facie case for relief is made out, the Board may deny the motion in discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
In view of the respondent’s refusal to appear at the hearing, at which he was represented by counsel, we find no error on the part of the Immigration Judge in proceeding in his absence. The respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge acted improperly or that he was prejudiced by the Immigration Judge’s conduct of the hearing. We also note that the respondent, who was represented by counsel, did not timely appeal this action, and has not addressed either his failure to submit a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s determination or provided an explanation as to why he did not submit a timely motion regarding this claim. Rather, the respondent waited for more than 10 years after his refusal to attend the hearing to raise this issue. Accordingly, as we find no error by the Immigration Judge, and in view of the respondent’s unexplained and excessive delay in raising this issue, reopening is not warranted.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael Wishnie, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Susan Egan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)º - Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
The respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s August 23, 2007, decision denying her motion to reconsider the Immigration Judge’s June 27, 2007, denial of her motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal order entered against her on June 5, 1997, will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nicaragua, was originally placed into these proceedings with the issuance of an Order to Show Cause on July 24, 1990 (Exh. 1). According to the record, a Notice of Appearance was filed on the respondent’s behalf by an accredited representative on June 25, 1992. On July 28, 1993, the respondent, through her accredited representative, conceded deportability as charged and accepted voluntary departure for a year or until July 27, 1994. Subsequently, after failing to depart, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge seeking suspension of deportation under NACARA. On October 15, 1996, over the objection of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service), the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
The record reflects that a Notice of Appearance was filed on behalf of the respondent by an attorney on September 6, 1996. On October 22, 1996, the respondent’s counsel was sent a Notice of Hearing by certified mailing notifying the respondent of a hearing scheduled on her application for suspension of deportation on February 13, 1997. After the respondent failed to appear at this scheduled heating, her case was postponed until June 5, 1997. On April 3, 1997, the respondent’s counsel was sent by certified mail a Notice of Hearing for June 5, 1997, and a signed return receipt was received by the Immigration Court. However, the respondent again failed to appear and an in absentia order, of removal was entered against her on that date. Subsequently, 10 years later, the respondent, through new counsel, filed the instant motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia order on June 20, 2007, arguing that she did not receive proper notice of her prior June 5, 1997, hearing and also arguing changed country conditions in Nicaragua affecting her claim. According to the respondent, no notice of hearing was sent to her address.
 
On June 27, 2007, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and rescind her in absentia order of removal (I.J. at 1-2). The Immigration Judge noted the respondent’s appearance at her July 28, 1993, hearing and the grant of voluntary departure (I.J. at 1-2). In regard to the respondent’s scheduled June 5, 1997, hearing in relation to the grant of her motion to reopen, the Immigration Judge noted the inclusion in the record of the Notice of Hearing for the June 5, 1997, heating sent to respondent’s counsel and returned with a signed return receipt (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge also noted the respondent’s admission as to having departed the United States on February 15, 1997, after the filing of her motion to reopen but prior to the hearing (I.J. at 2). The respondent remained outside of the United States until 2001 (I.J. at 2). As a result, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent’s motion was untimely and that she did not have jurisdiction over the respondent’s motion under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) (2007), which bars the filing of a motion to reopen on behalf of a person subject to proceedings subsequent to departure from the United States (I.J. at 3-4). The Immigration Judge also noted that she would have denied the motion in discretion given the respondent’s previous immigration history (I.J. at 3-4).
 
*2 On July 23, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge contending for the first time that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel alleging that her attorney failed to notify her of the scheduled hearings and the possibility of an in absentia order. See Respondent’s Motion at 2. The respondent further alleged that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that her motion was untimely filed because of the ineffective assistance of counsel and that she was without jurisdiction because, the respondent argued, she did not depart the United States while she was subject to a final order of removal inasmuch as the motion to reopen had already been granted. Id. at 3 (emphasis added). The respondent alleged that she was facially eligible, for suspension of deportation. The DHS opposed the respondent’s motion arguing that the Immigration Judge had no jurisdiction under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1), and that the respondent failed to show due diligence in regard to her ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The DHS conceded that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that she did not have jurisdiction as found in her decision because the motion to reopen had already been granted.
 
On August 23, 2007, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider noting the DHS’s concession but finding that she had no jurisdiction under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) because the respondent departed the United States prior to the hearing on her motion which bad already been granted. The Immigration Judge also found that, while the respondent substantially complied with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), she did not show due diligence in pursuing her claim. On appeal, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in applying 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) to her case because she was not under a final order of removal at the time she departed. In opposition, the DHS contends that her motion is untimely and also alleges that the respondent has another outstanding order of removal entered against her in absentia and was required to surrender for deportation on February 14, 2002, but did not. According to the DHS, the respondent is in separate proceedings under a different alien number because she reentered the United States in 2001 under a false name.
 
Initially, we find that the Immigration Judge misapplied 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) to the respondent’s case to find that she did not have jurisdiction. The record reflects that the respondent was inside the United States when her attorney filed the motion to reopen on her behalf on September 26, 1996; she did not depart until February 11, 1997, just 2 days prior to her scheduled February 13, 1997, initial hearing date. Thus, the filing bar in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) is not applicable to the respondent’s case.
 
*3 However, we agree that the respondent has failed to establish her burden for reopening and rescission and further find that she has failed to sustain her burden of proof in establishing her ineffective assistance of counsel claim. As previously discussed, the respondent did not file her motion until 10 years after the in absentia order was entered against her. In this regard, she now claims that her motion should be granted because her former attorney, who represented her during her motion, failed to notify her of the hearing date and, on this basis, asserts that she has been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. As we understand the respondent’s contentions, she argues both a lack of notice and that any applicable filing deadline for her motion should be excused because she has been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent predicates her lack of notice argument upon her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and, thus, these arguments in this case are inextricably intertwined.
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, has determined that the deadline for motions to reopen deportation proceedings may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000). In order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in this way, an alien must demonstrate not only that her constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that she has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case. Id. Here, we find that the long delay in filing the motion to reopen is not reasonably explained by the circumstances of this case. The evidence of record indicates that the respondent hired counsel to file her motion to reopen. Contra, respondent’s July 19, 2007 declaration in support of motion to reconsider, (¶ 13), claiming she was never told her case had been reopened, only that her attorney did not thereafter notify her of the bearing date. In this regard, the respondent has failed to provide any reasonable basis as to why, during a 10-year span, she did not contact her counsel to find out when a hearing had been scheduled or why she waited 10 years to learn of the outcome of those proceedings. In this regard, the respondent’s claim that she was not notified of the hearing date is not reasonable inasmuch as she was aware that her motion was granted and failed to take any action for 10 years.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jon Eric Garde, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Leslie E. Smith Turner
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on August 22, 2006, when we affirmed an Immigration Judge’s April 8, 2005, decision denying the respondent’s motion to continue the proceedings pending the adjudication of a visa petition filed on her behalf. The Immigration Judge denied the motion as a matter of discretion based, in part, on her finding that the respondent attempted to conceal the fact that she had participated in fraud to procure a visa to enter the United States. See I.J. at 12-13. See also Onyeme v. U.S. I.N.S., 146 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir. 1998) (whether to grant a motion to continue deportation proceedings is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. On July 2, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit declared that the Immigration Judge’s refusal to grant the continuance was not an abuse of discretion, and denied the respondent’s petition for review of our decision. Flores v. Gonzales, 231 Fed.Appx. 283 (4th Cir. 2007) (unpublished). The respondent’s now moves to reopen our August 22, 2006, decision based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R.§ 1003.2(c). See also Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Although the Board has no record of receiving the motion prior to October 9, 2007, the respondent’s attorney asserts that the motion was timely filed on August 20, 2006, and he has submitted documentation in support thereof. We will deem the motion to have been timely filed. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent attempted to conceal pertinent facts was based on an adverse credibility determination. The respondent now reiterates her appellate arguments that she was confused during the removal hearings, and that she did not knowingly participate in fraud in procuring a visa. The Board rejected these arguments when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision, and we will not revisit them at this time. See INS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450 U.S. 139, 141 (1981) (discussing motions to reopen). The respondent further attempts to blame her former attorney for allegedly failing to prepare her adequately to testify at the removal hearings. It is not alleged by the respondent, and there is no basis to determine, however, that her former attorney advised her to conceal facts from the Immigration Judge. We emphasize that the respondent was placed under oath and that she swore to tell the truth during the removal hearings. See Tr. at 12. The respondent’s current explanations to account for the attempted concealment of facts fail to overcome her obligation to testify truthfully during the removal hearings. We reject the respondent’s efforts to shift the blame for her own actions to her former attorney. Indeed, we find no prejudicial error on the part of the respondent’s former attorney. See Figeroa v. INS, 886 F.2d 76 (4th Cir. 1989) (To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at a deportation proceeding, an alien must show not only ineffective representation, but also prejudice to him which occurred as a result of that ineffectiveness). The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied. The request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Victoria Calle, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mark J. Wurtz
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on June 29, 1999, because he failed to appear for his hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on August 15, 2007, but the Immigration Judge denied it on September 13, 2007. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues On appeal that he was not adequately notified of the hearing. The record reflects that the Notice of Hearing was mailed to the respondent’s former counsel, Bernard Rosenbloom. A copy was also mailed to the respondent at his last known address, 527 Madison Avenue, No. 2, Elizabeth, NJ 07201. The respondent denies having received the hearing notice from either the Immigration Court or his counsel. A Notice of Hearing sent to an alien’s attorney of record is proper notice. See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) and Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (1985). We further consider that the hearing notice was sent to an address provided on the Form I-830 and stated on counsel’s motion to withdraw filed on May 18, 1999. There is also no indication that the post office returned the notice as undeliverable. The respondent has further not denied the correctness of the address and has not alleged that he was not residing at that location when the notice was mailed. He also does not allege any problems with mail delivery at his home. In addition, the respondent was aware that he was in removal proceedings and apparently made no attempt to verify his immigration status until 2003. His reliance on the instruction of another alien that it often takes years to obtain a hearing date is not a valid excuse for failing to do so.
 
We have considered the totality of the evidence presented, and we cannot find based on the respondent’s denial of receipt that he has rebuted the presumption of delivery of the hearing notice. Maknojiya v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 588, 589 (5th Cir.2005) (noting the lower burden required for rebutting the presumption of delivery for correspondence sent by regular mail was met where both alien and his counsel submitted affidavits indicating that they did not receive the notice that reset the hearing from an earlier hearing date than originally scheduled). The notice provided in these proceedings was therefore adequate because it was received by former counsel and mailed to the respondent at his correct address. This aspect of the Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
The respondent further argues that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and therefore exceptional circumstances prevented his appearance for his hearing. He indicates in his affidavit that former counsel Bernard Rosenbloom did not notify him of his hearing, and told him that venue in these proceedings would be changed to New Jersey. He further indicates that Mr. Rosenbloom instructed him to wait for his next hearing date, and presumably did not inform the respondent that he had withdrawn as his representative. The respondent further indicates that he did not know until September 2003 that he was ordered removed from the United States in absentia. He also indicates that a second attorney negligently delayed his submission of his motion to reopen.
 
*2 A request for rescission of an order of removal based on “exceptional circumstances” must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). Even if we equitably tolled the 180-day period for seeking reopening, we cannot find that the respondent satisfied the procedural requirements for establishing attorney negligence. See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383 (5th Cir. 2001); Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The record reflects that a complaint has been filed against Mr. Rosenbloom with a Texas disciplinary authority. However, there was no showing that Mr. Rosenbloom was notified of the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel raised herein and allowed an opportunity to respond. We cannot find based solely on the respondent’s accounts that he was the victim of attorney negligence without a showing that his attorney was given an opportunity to provide his rendition of the facts. The respondent has therefore failed to establish that he was the victim of attorney negligence, and we cannot find that exceptional circumstances prevented his appearance for the hearing. We therefore need not address whether the respondent’s second attorney negligently delayed the submission of the motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Colombia, was ordered removed from the United States on October 10, 2006, because he failed to appear for a hearing. On March 30, 2007, he filed a motion to reopen alleging that he did not receive the Notice of Hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on May 16, 2007. On May 18, 2007, the respondent requested reconsideration before the Immigration Judge, indicating that he had filed a complaint against his prior counsel and that his prior counsel’s negligence caused his failure to appear for the hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on June 21, 2007. The respondent appealed from the Immigration Judge’s June 21, 2007, decision and requested reopening of proceedings based on the criminal court’s August 6, 2007, order granting his motion to vacate his plea on the charge of possession of cannabis. On August 29, 2007, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal and denied his request for reopening because it was unclear whether his conviction had been vacated for substantive reasons and, even if it was vacated for substantive reasons, he remained convicted of attempted burglary of a structure, which rendered him removable under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). The respondent has now filed a motion to reconsider our August 29, 2007, decision. The respondent’s motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
In his motion to reconsider, the respondent argues that we erred in dismissing his appeal. Specifically, the respondent contends that he established that he did not receive notice of his original hearing and that his prior counsel was negligent by failing to submit a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative (Form G-28) before the Immigration Court. The respondent further contends that proceedings should be reopened because his conviction for attempted burglary of a structure has been recently reopened.
 
We find that the respondent’s motion to reconsider fails to identify any material error of fact or law in our prior decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1) (stating that a motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Instead, the motion to reconsider reiterates many of the arguments presented by the respondent on appeal. Specifically, the respondent’s arguments regarding notice of his hearing and his prior counsel’s negligence were raised on appeal. As we considered these arguments in rendering our prior decision, we decline to revisit them. The remaining arguments presented by the respondent do not establish that we overlooked any material issue in rendering our prior decision or that we otherwise erred in dismissing his appeal and denying his request for reopening. Specifically, we reject the respondent’s argument that we erred in our prior decision by finding that it was unclear if he had notified his prior counsel that he had accused him of ineffective assistance of counsel. In this regard, we note that, in our prior decision, we found that, even if the procedural requirements for proving ineffective assistance of counsel were established, reopening was not warranted because the respondent failed to establish that his prior counsel was negligent.
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent argues that proceedings should be reopened because his conviction for attempted burglary of a structure has been reopened by the criminal court, we find that reopening is not warranted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent is not asking us to give effect to an actual court order vacating his criminal conviction. Instead, the respondent seeks to have his removal proceedings reopened and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge only to have the proceedings held in abeyance pending what he hopes is a favorable disposition of the collateral attack on his conviction in the criminal court. Collateral attacks on convictions or requests for post-conviction relief do not prevent a conviction from being final for immigration purposes unless relief is granted. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996).
 
Finally, to the extent that the respondent seeks to have us reopen proceedings sua sponte, we do not find that reopening on our own motion is warranted in the present matter. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see also Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding that the Board’s power to reopen eases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Martin W. Chow, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa M. Putnam
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 On May 4, 2007, the Board affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision, in which the judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings, which were conducted in absentia. The respondent, who is from China, filed a motion to reopen on July 13, 2007. The motion, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”), will be granted, and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The motion to reopen presented to the Immigration Court claimed that the respondent did not appear at his July 5, 2006, removal hearing because a former attorney had told him that he had filed a motion seeking to change venue and the respondent did not have to appear at the scheduled hearing in Texas. In affirming the decision of the Immigration denying reopening, the Board considered the respondent’s contention that the attorney told him that he did not need to attend the scheduled hearing. However, the Board determined, the respondent failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. That is, although the respondent had submitted an affidavit with his motion, he failed to submit evidence that he had filed a disciplinary complaint against prior counsel, or informed prior counsel of his allegations.
 
With the motion to reopen, the respondent presents evidence that he has now filed a disciplinary complaint against prior counsel, and has notified prior counsel of his claims. Former counsel responded, and disputes that he told the respondent that he did not need to attend the hearing.
 
Under the circumstances, we find it appropriate to allow the respondent an opportunity for a hearing.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s order of May 4, 2007, is rescinded.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mario Acosta, Jr., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Angela M. Fontova
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was previously before us on July 12, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 28, 2007, which denied his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, filed this motion to reopen and to terminate removal proceedings on October 9, 2007. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent argues that we should reopen and terminate proceedings because the DHS never established his removability by clear and convincing evidence, and that the failure of his attorney, Edgardo Quintanilla, to raise the issue of removability on appeal constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. See Respondent’s Motion to Reopen at 5-11, Exh. C. With respect to attorney Quintanilla, the motion appears to substantially comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 824-25 (9th Cir. 2003). However, we do not find that the respondent has established the requisite prejudice necessary to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel from attorney Quintanilla to warrant reopening. See Serrano v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 1317, 1319 (9th Cir. 2007).
 
We agree with the respondent that it is the DHS’s burden to establish that an alien is removable. See section 240(c)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(a). However, removability may be established by admission of the respondent. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(a). In this case, during the proceedings before the Immigration Judge, the respondent, through his counsel at that time, attorney Daniel Hanlon, admitted all of the factual allegations and conceded removability as charged in the Notice to Appear (Exh. 1; Tr. at 13, 18). Such an admission by the respondent’s attorney, acting in his professional capacity during the respondent’s removal hearing, is binding on the respondent, and he is not permitted to challenge the factual findings or legal conclusions of the Immigration Judge that arose from that admission. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986). See also U.S. v. Davis, 332 F.3d 1163, 1168 (9th Cir. 2003) (factual stipulations may be treated as judicial admissions, which have the effect of withdrawing a fact from issue and dispensing wholly with the need for proof of the fact, and are binding on both the parties and the court). In this motion, the respondent has not demonstrated that, if attorney Quintanilla had raised the issue of removability before us on appeal, the outcome would have been different, i.e., we would have found that the respondent was not bound by his attorney Hanlon’s admissions on the record and that he was not removable. See Munoz v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 950, 955 (9th Cir. 2003). Although the respondent states that he did not feel that attorney Hanlon adequately represented him because he did not challenge removability, see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Exh. C, we emphasize that the current motion does not comply at all with Matter of Lozada, supra, with respect to attorney Hanlon.¿FN1º Accordingly, the motion is denied.

In the brief on appeal to this Board, the respondent, through attorney Quintanilla, argued that attorney Hanlon provided ineffective assistance when he failed to present to the Immigration Judge the argument that the respondent’s alcohol and drug use was a disease. See Respondent’s Brief at 6-9. We rejected this argument in our July 12, 2007, decision on appeal, noting that tactical decisions in the preparation and presentation of an alien’s case did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel, and citing Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 934 (9th Cir. 1986).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Run A. Kamran, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Maria N. Bjornerud
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before this Board on July 27, 2007, when we sustained the appeal of the DHS from the Immigration Judge’s grant of a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1182(c), in the exercise of discretion, denied the application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Act in the exercise of discretion, and vacated the grant of section 212(c) relief by the Immigration Judge. The respondent, through new counsel, has now filed a motion to reopen alleging that his former counsel, who represented him before the Immigration Judge, was ineffective in his representation because he failed to adequately prepare and present the respondent’s case. The contention of present counsel that former counsel was ineffective is wholly without factual or legal merit.
 
The instant motion does comply with the requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth by this Board in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). However, the instant motion does not establish that his former counsel was ineffective in representing him at his hearing before the Immigration Judge. Respondent’s present counsel asserts that respondent’s former counsel was ineffective because he did not present the testimony of available witnesses, because he did not present the testimony of an expert witness, and because he did not object to questioning by the Immigration Judge which present counsel argues concerned immaterial matters.
 
The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“DHS”), correctly notes in opposition to the respondent’s motion, that former counsel presented affidavits executed by the available witnesses and informed the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s spouse would testify to facts consistent with her affidavit. The DHS also notes that respondent’s former counsel did submit a recommendation letter from a clinical psychologist in support of the respondent’s claims of rehabilitation. Finally, the DHS also correctly asserts that the questioning of the respondent by the Immigration Judge concerning the respondent’s sexual practices is relevant to a determination of whether a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted where concerns in the case arise due to the respondent’s sexual abuse of a child.
 
Ineffective assistance of counsel in a removal proceedings is a denial of due process if the proceeding was so fundamentally tmfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case. See Lopez v. INS, 775 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir. 1985). In any case presenting an ineffectiveness claim, the performance inquiry must be whether counsel’s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984). Methods of case presentation are within counsel’s professional judgment and are afforded great deference. See Strickland v. Washington, supra at 688-89. Strategic decisions, such as whether to call a particular witness at the hearing, rest upon the sound professional judgment of the lawyer.  Gustave v. United States, 627 F.2d 901, 904 (9th Cir. 1980). Such appropriately informed strategic decisions are virtually unchallengeable. See Strickland v. Washington, supra at 690.
 
*2 The assertion by respondent’s present counsel that presenting witnesses likely would have altered the outcome of the instant case is not fact but opinion. On the contrary, the presentation of witness testimony also carries with it the right of cross-examination which may result in the identification of additional adverse information or reason to discount the favorable information in a statement or affidavit that would otherwise go unchallenged. The decision in this matter to rely upon certain written statements and affidavits rather than presenting testimony subject to cross-examination is precisely the kind of informed strategic decision that rests upon the sound professional judgment of an attorney. Similarly, respondent’s former counsel had nothing to gain on behalf of the respondent by objecting to questioning by the Immigration Judge that the Immigration Judge found relevant to whether he was going to grant section 212(c) relief in the exercise of his discretion. Indeed, while information was elicited by the Immigration Judge’s questioning which concerned this Board, the Immigration Judge determined by his questioning that, in his opinion, the respondent was deserving of a favorable exercise of discretion.
 
The judgments of former counsel criticized by present counsel are the kind of strategic decisions that are virtually unchallengeable. In this matter, former counsel’s strategic decisions in the presentation of the respondent’s case initially resulted in a favorable determination. We do not find that those strategic decisions represent an attorney performing below the minimum standards of competence which the respondent had a right to expect. This is not an instance where former counsel failed to meet a deadline or submit an application, nor is this an instance where former counsel did not reasonably prepare for the hearing or present any evidence on the respondent’s behalf. Rather, this is an instance where present counsel is second-guessing former counsel’s method of case presentation and strategic decisions, out of a belief, which may not be accurate, that his own methods would not only have resulted in success before the Immigration Judge but also before this Board. As such, in the absence of “egregious circumstances,” an alien is bound by the “reasonable tactical decisions of his counsel.” See Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938, 942 (BIA 1995), citing Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 383 (BIA 1986); see also Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 933-34 (9th Cir. 1986). The respondent was not prevented from reasonably presenting his case that he was deserving of a favorable exercise of discretion. Accordingly, the instant motion to reopen is denied because the motion does not establish that respondent’s former counsel was ineffective.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Chris A. Chouteau, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Olga El Bagdadi
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Remand
 
The respondent appeals the October 5, 2006, decision of the Immigration Judge ordering her removed to Mexico and has filed a motion to remand. The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition to the motion to remand. The motion to remand will be granted.
 
The respondent moves to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel. To warrant such a remand, the respondent must comply with the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and demonstrate that she was prejudiced by her former counsel’s deficient performance. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent has sufficiently complied with the Lozada requirements, including having given her former counsel an opportunity to respond to the allegations and having filed a complaint with the State Bar of California. The respondent argues that her former counsel admitted the factual allegations and conceded removability without the respondent’s knowledge or consent, despite being told by the respondent before the hearing that she had not known that the passengers in her car were not in possession of legal documents to enter or reside in the United States.
 
The respondent submits that her former counsel did not meet in advance with her to prepare for the hearings, did not adequately review and discuss with her the facts of the case, and failed to take into account the respondent’s statement to him minutes before her first hearing that she had not known that the passengers in her car were not in possession of legal documents to enter the United States. The documents in the record support the respondent’s claim that she lacked knowledge that her passengers did not have valid documents (Exhs. 4, 6). By admitting on behalf of the respondent the charge of alien smuggling, the respondent’s former counsel waived the defense of lack of knowledge. This amounts to deficient representation.
 
The Immigration Judge based his finding of removability on the admissions and concessions that the respondent’s former counsel made on her behalf. We therefore conclude that the respondent was prejudiced by her former counsel’s deficient performance. Under these circumstances, we conclude that a new hearing is warranted. We will therefore grant the respondent’s motion to remand.
 
ORDER: The motion to remand is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

IN RE: RAMON ARCADIO GUTIERREZ-CASTILLO
FILE: AXX XX5 617 - BOSTON, MA
November 30, 2007
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert J. Caron, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on August 20, 2001. The respondent, who is from the Dominican Republic, filed the pending motion to reopen on October 3, 2007. The motion is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent was convicted in 1980 in New York of assault in the first degree, and was sentenced to incarceration for 6-18 years. The respondent spent 11 years in prison as a result of this conviction (Tr. at 53). The Immigration Judge concluded that, after passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Division C of Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (“IIRIRA”), the respondent was ineligible for relief under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), and the Board affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge.
 
The respondent claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from Randy Olen, who represented him before the Immigration Judge and on appeal to the Board. The respondent claims that Olen erred in not filing a brief with the Board contending that he should be able to apply for 2120(h) relief. Equitable tolling of the motions deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence. Chen v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 151, 154 (1st Cir. 2005); Jobe v. 1NS, 238 F.3d 96, 98-99 (1st Cir. 2001). The Board notes that the appeal was filed on December 12, 1996, and according to their affidavits neither the respondent nor Olen made any effort to check the status of the appeal until August, 2007, almost 11 years later. However, the Board also acknowledges that its August 20, 2001, decision was sent to an incorrect address for Olen.
 
Even tolling the motions deadline in this case, the motion is denied for failure to show prejudice resulting from the alleged failures of prior counsel. Zeru v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 59, 72 (1st Cir. 2007); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent contends that he should have been able to seek relief under section 212(h) of the Act, notwithstanding the passage of IIRIRA, as he was eligible for such relief at the time deportation proceedings were instituted in 1994, and proceedings were delayed while the now-DHS considered an I-130 visa petition filed on his behalf. However, the respondent is statutorily precluded from a section 212(h) waiver of inadmissibility as an alien who has been admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident who has been convicted of an aggravated felony. See Matter of Yeung, 21 I&N Dec. 610 (BIA 1996) (finding that IIRIRA’s amendments to section 212(h) relief, which make a lawful permanent resident alien convicted of an aggravated felony ineligible for a waiver, are retroactive); see also Alvarez-Barajas v. Gonzales, 418 F.3d 1050, 1054-55 (9th Cir. 2005); Guaylupo-Moya v. Gonzales, 423 F.3d 121 (2d Cir. 2005).
 
*2 The respondent urges the Board to reopen proceedings under its sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). This action is taken only in “exceptional situations.” Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373 (A.G. 2002); Zhang v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 51, 53 (1st Cir. 2006)(acknowledging Board’s authority to reopen sua sponte is beyond court’s jurisdiction to review). As the respondent is ineligible for the relief requested, the Board declines to reopen proceedings under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
The pending motion is, therefore, denied, and the request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

November 30, 2007
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Juan C. Freire, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider the Board’s June 6, 2007, decision affirming the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed an opposition. The motion will be granted, the appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.
 
A motion to reconsider must specify the errors in the prior Board decision and be supported by pertinent authority. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). In his motion to reconsider, the respondent maintains that the Board erred in failing to address his contention on appeal that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion by denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. We agree that the Board should have addressed that issue. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
Immigration Judges have regulatory authority to set filing deadlines, and if those deadlines are not met the “opportunity to file that application or document shall be deemed waived.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). While Immigration Judges have broad authority under the regulations, 8 C.F.R. § 1240.41, that authority is not without limitation. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (the Board may review de novo the exercise of discretion by an Immigration Judge). The respondent contends that clerical error on the part of his former counsel caused him not to timely file his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (repealed 1996).¿FN1º
 
In this case, we conclude that the Immigration Judge was unnecessarily rigid in his application of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) and abused his discretion by denying the respondent’s timely motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge appears to have failed to take into account all factors relevant to reopening. First, the motion to reopen was filed, including the completed application for relief, well over a month before the scheduled Individual Hearing and indicated a readiness to go forward on that scheduled date. Cf. Matter of Shanu, 23 I&N Dec. 754, 764-65 (BIA 2005) (affirming the Immigration Judge’s pretermission of the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal when it was filed after the deadline set by the Immigration Judge and on the scheduled day of the Individual Hearing, thereby precluding advance review of it by the government and the Immigration Judge), vacated on other grounds, 450 F.3d 578 (4th Cir. 2006). Second, the DHS did not oppose the motion to reopen.¿FN2º There is no asserted prejudice to the DHS or negative effect on the Immigration Court that may have resulted from the late filing. Finally, the respondent’s application for a section 212(c) waiver on its face reveals a substantial likelihood of success. It shows the respondent has very strong positive equities, including the fact that he has been a lawful permanent resident for almost 40 years and that the convictions serving as a basis for removability occurred in 1977. Accordingly, the prejudice to the respondent by denying the late filing was significant. Under these circumstances, we conclude that it was an abuse of discretion for the Immigration Judge to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen. See Ungar v. Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 589 (1964) (“a myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay” can amount to an abuse of discretion). Accordingly, the motion to reconsider will be granted. Upon reconsideration, the appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for proceedings consistent with this order.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reconsider is granted, and the Board’s June 6, 2007, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Upon reconsideration, the appeal is sustained and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

While the respondent is still represented by the same law firm, he notes in his motion to reconsider that the law firm terminated the employment of the attorney whose error is at issue. Although it is clear that the respondent was prejudiced by his former counsel’s error, he does not raise ineffective assistance of counsel and has not met the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER:
 
Elizabeth M. Mendoza Macias, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Pauline A. Appelbaum
Associate Regional Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Petition to classify status of alien relative for issuance of immigrant visa
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The petitioner filed an appeal from a decision dated September 19, 2005, by the district director of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) denying the petition to classify the respondent as the child of a United States citizen. The district director, in denying the visa petition, referenced the Notice of Intent to Deny, dated August 9, 2005, which stated that section 204(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1154(e), applied because the beneficiary’s prior marriage was fraudulent. Matter of Tawfik, 20 I&N Dec. 166 (BIA 1990), states that the evidence of a fraudulent marriage “must be documented in the alien’s file and must be substantial and probative.” Id. at 167.
 
In the instant case, the petitioner did not respond to the NOID. Further, the record contains substantial and probative evidence of marriage fraud, both in statements made by the beneficiary’s former spouse indicating that their marriage was not bona fide, and in investigative reports presented by DHS.
 
On appeal, the petitioner submits several sworn statements where the beneficiary’s spouse has recanted her statements that her marriage to the beneficiary was not bona fide. However, the petitioner has not explained why this evidence was not submitted previously. He states that his prior attorney should have submitted this evidence, but the petitioner has not raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Where, as here, a petitioner has been put on notice of a deficiency in the evidence and has been given an opportunity to respond to that deficiency, this Board will not accept evidence offered for the first time on appeal. Matter of Soriano, 19 I&N Dec. 764 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of Obaigbena, 19 I&N Dec. 533 (BIA 1988). Under the circumstances, we need not and do not comment on the sufficiency of the evidence forwarded on appeal. For the reasons stated above, the appeal is dismissed.
 
The petitioner may, of course, file a new visa petition that is supported by competent evidence that the beneficiary is entitled to the status sought under the immigration laws.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTIONS
  
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&Y Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43XF)
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals an Immigration Judge’s August 20, 2007, decision finding him removable as charged. The respondent also moves to remand the proceedings and to stay his removal pending the disposition of this appeal. The appeal will be dismissed; the motion to remand will be denied and the motion to stay will be denied as moot.
 
The respondent argues that his state felony conviction resulting in a sentence of more than one year stems from ineffective assistance of counsel. He asserts that he was originally offered a plea bargain requiring him to serve less than 1 year’s confinement in the county jail, and he was aware that a sentence of less than 1 year would have no immigration consequences. However, the respondent contends, his trial counsel advised him that he could accept a term of probation in lieu of incarceration, without informing him that if he violated the terms of the probation, he could face deportation. The respondent further asserts that his probation officer illegally imposed a “special condition” by requiring him to report to a probation office in another county. Since the “special condition” was not announced at sentencing, the respondent posits, according to Florida law it was invalid and could not form the basis for the probation revocation and the imposition of the sentence that underpins his aggravated felony removal charge.
 
To the extent that the respondent attempts to assert a claim of ineffective assistance by his state criminal trial counsel, this is not the forum with jurisdiction to address such a grievance. See Matter of Rodriguez-Carillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031 (BIA 1999) (the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider a collateral attack on a facially valid judgment of conviction). Similarly, the respondent’s challenge to the conditions of his probation constitute a collateral attack that properly should be resolved before the body that imposed those conditions. See id. According to the record before us, the removal charges against the respondent have been sustained by clear and convincing evidence and no forms of relief from removal are available to him. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s findings.
 
The respondent alleges in his remand motion that he was never presented with or served personally or by certified mail with a Notice to Appear.¿FN1º This statement is belied by his testimony at his June 22, 2007, telephonic removal hearing, when, in response to the Immigration Judge’s query as to whether he had received the charging document setting forth the reasons why the government alleged that he was reportable, the respondent replied “Yes.” See Tr. at 1 line 19. He acknowledges that he was aware of the charges, but claims that the 2-day telephonic notice of his hearing provided him insufficient time to retain counsel or prepare for the hearing. In contrast, not only does the record reflect that he conceded service of the charging document, but the Immigration Judge continued his hearing for 4 weeks to allow him to obtain counsel. See id. at 4, 5. The respondent also propounds his arguments that he received unsatisfactory advice from trial counsel and that he was ill-served by the conditions of his probation, issues which, as discussed supra, are beyond the purview of the Board. See Matter of Rodriguez-Carillo, supra. He also identifies factors that would mitigate in his favor if he qualified for a form of relief from removal, which, as noted, he does not. Under these circumstances, there is no purpose to be served by remanding the proceedings.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to stay removal during the pendency of this appeal is denied as moot.

The respondent also argues that he was never served with an Order to Show Cause. However, an Order to Show Cause would have been inapplicable to these removal proceedings, which were commenced on March 13, 2007. The “Order to Show Cause,” which initiated deportation proceedings, was replaced with the “Notice to Appear,” which initiated removal proceedings, upon the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), effective April 1, 1997.

We affirm the Immigration Judge’s May 17, 2006, decision ordering the respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, removed from the United States as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation. Section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S,C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) (2000)
 
In a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) filed with the Immigration Court on February 3, 2005, the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) charged the respondent with inadmissibility under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act on the basis of a 1997 conviction for attempted criminal sale of cocaine in violation of sections 110 and 220.39 of the New York Penal Law. (Exh. 1). At a removal hearing conducted on March 30, 2005, the respondent’a attorney admitted all factual allegations contained in the NTA, admitted “the basis for charge of removal,” and requested a continuance to explore whether the respondent was eligible for any form of relief from removal. (Tr. at 8). At a subsequent hearing conducted on May 16, 2006, moreover, the same attorney conceded that the respondent was not in fact eligible for any form of relief. (Tr. at 30-31). Accordingly, the Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed on the basis of his admissions and concessions. On appeal, the respondent now argues for the first time that his removability was not established by clear and convincing evidence, despite the admissions and concessions of his counsel, because the DHS offered no documentary evidence to prove the existence of his 1997 drug conviction. The argument is meritless.
 
Applicable regulations, which have the force and effect of law as to the Immigration Judges and this Board, provide in pertinent part that “the immigration judge may determine that removability as charged has been established by the admissions of the respondent.” 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c) (2005). Accordingly, the distinct and formal concession of removability, made by the respondent’s attorney acting in his professional capacity during the respondent’s removal hearing, is binding on the respondent as a judicial admission, and he will not now be heard to challenge the factual findings or legal conclusions of the Immigration Judge that arose from that concession. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986); see also Ali v. Reno, 22 F.3d 442, 446 (2d Cir. 1994) (citing Matter of Velasquez, supra, and holding that an alien in deportation proceedings is bound by the admissions of counsel); Oscanyan v. Arms Co., 103 U.S. 261, 263 (1880) (holding that “¿tºhe power of the court to act in the disposition of a trial upon facts conceded by counsel is as plain as its power to act upon the evidence produced”); cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(B) (authorizing summary dismissal of appeals when “¿tºhe only reason for the appeal specified by the party concerned involves a finding of fact or a conclusion of law that was conceded by that party at a prior proceeding”).¿FN1º Furthermore, an attorney’s concession of removability is binding even if the removal proceeding is predicated on criminal convictions. See Matter of Pichardo, 21 I&N Dec. 330, 333 n.2 (BIA 1996) (“had the respondent admired to the Service’s factual allegation or conceded his deportability … it would have been unnecessary for the Service to present a record of conviction or other documents admissible as evidence in proving a criminal conviction”); LeTourneur v. INS, 538 F.2d 1368, 1371 (9th Cir. 1976) (holding alien bound by counsel’s concession of deportability in the crime involving moral turpitude context).
 
*2 In conclusion, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s decision ordering the respondent removed from the United States on the basis of his attorney’s concession of removability. Because the respondent is removable on the basis of his concession, moreover, we do not address his appellate arguments regarding application of the categorical and modified categorical approaches.
 
The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Pro se
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Daniel J. Menes
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(D)(i)º Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s September 10, 2007, decision denying as number-barred his motion to rescind the in absentia order of removal entered against him on April 15, 1998, and reopen proceedings. The Immigration Judge noted that a prior motion to reopen had been denied by the court on July 31, 2007. The respondent argues on appeal that his prior attorney rendered ineffective assistance, which resulted in the denial of his initial motion to reopen and the failure of the Immigration Judge to consider the merits of his later-filed motion. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) urges affirmance. The motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, we note that the respondent has failed to comply with any of the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).¿FN1º Even assuming that the respondent had complied with Matter of Lozada, supra, and established that his former counsel’s performance was deficient, we find that the respondent has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by counsel’s representation. See Figeroa v. INS, 886 F.2d 76, 78 (48th Cir. 1989) (finding that to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim there must be a showing of prejudice by counsel’s performance). The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s initial motion to reopen because he failed to submit an affidavit to support his contention that he did not receive the Notice to Appear, and did not consider the merits of the respondent’s subsequently-filed motion to reopen because the respondent was number-barred from presenting a successive motion. The record reflects that while the respondent attached an affidavit to his later-filed motion stating that he did not receive the Notice to Appear, he did not address the evidence attached to the response by the DHS reflecting that the Notice to Appear was sent by certified mail to the address that the respondent provided and that the return receipt contains a signature reflecting delivery. In his appeal brief, the respondent argues that the opposition of the DHS to his motion to reopen “was only about court notice slip and P.O. Box address,” and that the Immigration Judge only considered this evidence but did not consider the other evidence in the record regarding the bona fides of his marriage and his request for adjustment of status. However, the respondent was required to establish that he was entitled to rescind the in absentia order of removal and reopen proceedings before the Immigration Judge could consider his request to adjust status.¿FN2º Because the respondent does not address the relevant issues regarding notice of the heating, he has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by his former attorney’s alleged deficient performance.
 
*2 As for the merits of the appeal, the Immigration Judge properly determined that the respondent is entitled to file only one motion to reopen an in absentia order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4). Because the respondent previously filed a motion to reopen that was considered and denied by the Immigration Judge on July 31, 2007, the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s subsequently-filed motion as number barred.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Under Matter of Lozada, supra, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be supported by an affidavit, reflect whether a complaint had been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, and include a response to the allegations by former counsel or report counsel’s failure or refusal to respond. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639.

While an alien in certain circumstances may seek to reopen to apply for new relief without rescinding a motion to reopen, the respondent was not seeking new relief, and any request to reopen to apply for adjustment of status would be untimely under 8C.F.R. § 1003.23 Co)(3).

APPLICATION: Continuance
 
On June 29, 2006, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s request for a continuance and ordered him removed from the United States. The respondent has appealed from this decision. The appeal will be dismissed. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(7).
  
I. BACKGROUND
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Pakistan. He originally entered the United States in 1980 but left in 1983 to return to Pakistan. He then returned to the United States in 1987 and appears to have entered without inspection. The respondent filed an application for labor certification through his former attorney, Terry Gish, in 2001. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) placed him in removal proceedings in January 2005. Mr. Gish appears to have been the respondent’s attorney at this time, but he never appeared at the respondent’s hearings. The Immigration Judge thus gave the respondent the opportunity to obtain new counsel.
 
On December 22, 2005, the respondent appeared at his hearing with his present attorney. The Immigration Judge then granted the respondent three continuances to allow his attorney to look into the availability of various forms of relief and to obtain the respondent’s file from his former counsel. The respondent’s current counsel was never able to obtain the respondent’s file. On June 29, 2006, however, the respondent’s attorney asked the Immigration Judge to continue the respondent’s case once again to preserve the respondent’s eligibility for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1551 (i). The Immigration Judge denied the request on the ground that the case had already been postponed on numerous occasions and many efforts had been made to assist the respondent in pursing relief but the respondent’s prospects for relief remained highly speculative. The respondent has appealed from this decision.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge’s denial of his request for a continuance was a denial of due process because it pretermitted both his potential application for adjustment under section 245(i) of the Act and his claim of prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent contends that he retained his former attorney to file a labor certification before April 30, 2001 to preserve his eligibility for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act, but it appears that his former attorney may not have filed the labor certification in a timely manner. The respondent argues that this potential failure constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel because it effectively precludes him from pursuing adjustment under section 245(i) of the Act. The respondent also maintains that his former attorney’s failure to turn over his file constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and makes the Immigration Judge’s removal order reversible as the order denies the respondent due process. The respondent claims that it is his former attorney’s failure to turn over his file that makes him unable to show the Immigration Judge that he is eligible for adjustment under section 245(i) of the Act and entitled to a continuance of his case.
  
II. ANALYSIS
 
*2 The key issue before us on appeal is whether the Immigration Judge erred in denying the respondent’s request for a continuance given all of the circumstances in the respondent’s case, including a potential claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. According to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29, an Immigration Judge “may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.” The decision to grant or deny a continuance is within the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge and will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that the respondent was deprived of a full and fair hearing. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987); see also Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 1984) (finding that an alien must show that he was prejudiced by a procedural defect before his proceedings will be invalidated).
 
In this case, we find that the Immigration Judge had good cause to deny the respondent’s request for a continuance. And the respondent has not offered any evidence to indicate that the Immigration Judge’s ruling deprived him of a full and fair hearing. The evidence of record instead indicates that the respondent is not eligible for any relief from removal.
 
The only relief for which the respondent claims eligibility is adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act. To be eligible for this form of relief, the respondent had to file an application for labor certification or an application for an immigrant visa on or before April 30, 2001. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.10(a)(1). The information in the respondent’s brief on appeal suggests that the respondent did not meet this requirement. Specifically, the respondent’s attorney states in footnote 1 on pate 7 of the brief that he has obtained the respondent’s file from the Department of Labor and that the cover letter to the respondent’s application for labor certification bears a stamp stating “ALC Rcvd May 04, 2001”. See Brief for Appellant at 7, fn 1. The respondent contends that it is the date the application was postmarked rather that the date of the stamp that establishes the filing date, but this contention is incorrect. The pertinent regulation, 8C.F.R. § 1245.10(a)(2), states that, for an application for labor certification, “properly filed” means that the application was filed and accepted pursuant to the regulations of the Secretary of Labor.”¿FN1º The regulations of the Secretary of Labor, in turn, indicate that the filing date for a non-electronically filed application is the date the application is stamped. See 20 C.F.R. § 656.17(c)(titled “filing date” and stating that “¿nºon-electronically filed applications accepted for processing shall be date stamped” while ¿eºlectronically filed applications will be considered filed when submitted”). Given this information, it does not appear that the respondent’s failure to obtain his former attorney’s file and the postmarked date of his application for labor certification impacts his case. The information in the respondent’s appellate brief establishes that the respondent’s application for labor certification was properly filed on May 4, 2001. The respondent therefore does not appear to qualify as a “grandfathered alien” for the purposes of section 245(i) of the Act and does not appear eligible for adjustment of status under this provision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.10(a)(1). In light of this fact, we cannot conclude that the Immigration Judge erred in refusing to continue the respondent’s proceeding to allow him to pursue adjustment of status. See Ahmed v. Gonzales, 447 F.3d 433, 439 (5th Cir. 2006) (finding that alien lacked good cause for a continuance because he was ineligible for removal relief under the relevant statutes); Ramchandani v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 337, 339-40 (5th Cir. 2005).
 
*3 In addition, even if the respondent’s application for labor certification had been filed on or before April 30, 2001 so that the respondent could qualify for adjustment under section 245(i) of the Act, the respondent, at the time of his hearing before the Immigration Judge, still would have had many requirements to satisfy before he truly would have been entitled to adjustment of status. First, his application for labor certification would have to have been approved, and, as of the date of his appellant brief, this had not happened. Next, the respondent would need to have an employer file a visa petition on his behalf, have that petition approved, and have a current priority date. This process could take years and, given the number of opportunities for denials and the ultimate discretionary nature of adjustment itself, we cannot conclude that the Immigration Judge erred in denying the respondent’s request for a continuance to pursue the process. See Ahmed v. Gonzales, supra, (finding that Immigration Judge had good cause to deny continuance when alien had only filed labor certification and did not yet meet requirements for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act).¿FN2 º In fact, once the DHS initiates deportation or removal proceedings, neither an Immigration Judge nor this Board can terminate or indefinitely adjourn the proceedings in order to delay an alien’s deportation or removal. See Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348 (BIA 1982). Given these facts, we find no basis for reversing the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request for a continuance.
 
In reaching this conclusion, we note that the respondent’s possible claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not alter our findings. While the respondent’s former counsel may have been responsible for the late filing of the respondent’s application for labor certification, our ruling on the Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance would have been the same whether the labor certification was timely filed or not. And the late filing will not prejudice the respondent with respect to his ability to apply for adjustment until his labor certification is approved and he becomes the beneficiary of an approved and current visa petition. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003)(indicating that alien must show that he or she was prejudiced by the actions or inactions of counsel). Accordingly, we cannot find that the respondent is entitled to further proceedings on account of the actions of his former counsel.¿FN3º
 
Finally, with respect to the respondent’s due process arguments, we note that the Fifth Circuit repeatedly has held that discretionary relief from removal, including an application for adjustment of status, is not a liberty or property right that requires due process protection. See Ahmed v. Gonzales, supra, at 440, citing Assaad v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir. 2004)(stating, in a removal context, that due process claims revolving around an alleged failure to receive discretionary relief are not based upon a constitutionally protected liberty interest) and Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, 349 F.3d 213, 219 (5th Cir. 2003) (holding that eligibility for discretionary relief from a removal order is not a liberty or property interest warranting due process protection). We therefore cannot conclude that the respondent has raised valid due process arguments.
 
*4 Based on the foregoing, we find that the Immigration Judge acted properly in denying the respondent’s request for a continuance, and we dismiss the respondent’s appeal.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The regulation (8 C.F.R. § 1245.10(a)(2)) cross-references 20 C.F.R. § 656.21 for labor certifications, but 20 C.F.R. § 656.17 (basic labor certification process) appears to be the relevant regulation.

2

The respondent has cited Subhan v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 591 (7th Cir. 2004), in support of his arguments, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the circuit in which the respondent’s case arises, has declined to follow the Seventh Circuit’s reasoning in Subhan. We therefore cannot conclude that the ruling is controlling in this case.

3

In reaching this conclusion, we note that it is not clear that the Immigration Judge or this Board has the power to remedy the late filing of the respondent’s labor certification even if the respondent is able to establish potential eligibility for adjustment of status and prejudice.

*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Termination; Remand
 
On February 28, 2005, the Immigration Judge found the respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, removable as charged. This matter was last before us on July 13, 2006, when we granted the respondent’s motion to remand pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), in finding that the evidence submitted revealed a factual question as to whether the respondent smuggled aliens into the United States. The respondent now appeals the Immigration Judge’s November 17, 2006, decision again finding him removable as charge d. The appeal is dismissed.
 
In pertinent part, the regulations provide that the Board may summarily dismiss any appeal in which the only reason for the appeal specified by the party concerned involves a finding of fact or a conclusion of law that was conceded by that party at a prior hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(2)(B). In this case, the respondent indicated through counsel at the November 17, 2006, hearing that he was not objecting to the Form I-213, the essential document through which the Department of Homel and Security (“DHS”) aimed to prove the charge (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 8-12). The Form I-213 reflects that the respondent admitted to borrowing the California birth certificates of his sister- in-law and his cousin’s son in an attempt to smuggle two aliens into the United States from Mexico (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 4-5). The respondent further indicated at the hearing that he would not be presenting any rebuttal evidence, motion to suppress the DHS documentation, or allegations of coercion (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 11-13). Moreover, the respondent does not contest the Form I-213 in his brief, stating “I know what I did was wrong and have learn ¿sicº my lesson.” The respondent also conceded that he is not eligible for any form of relief from removal (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 2-3, 13- 14). Therefore, we find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s decision ordering him removed to Mexico.
 
We further note that the respondent alleges in his brief that his former attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to contest the Form I-213. As an initial matter, remand is not warranted on this basis because the respondent failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, supra. Additionally, the record does not support the respondent’s contention that his former attorney provided ineffective assistance. The espondent’s attorney stated that he reviewed the Form 1-213 with him through a Spanish interpreter and he offered no objections (Tr. at 8-9). The respondent also did not object to the Form I-213 or the representations of his attorney at the hearing, despite the fact that a Spanish interpreter was present. Accordingly, we reject the respondent’s claim that his concession of removability resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 For these reasons, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mike Ochoa
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)º - Convicted of crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Removability
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s November 22, 2006, decision ordering the respondent removed from the United States as an alien who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within 5 years after admission for which a sentence of 1 year or longer may be imposed. See section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i).
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that the Immigration Judge deprived her of a full and fair hearing when he denied her request for a continuance so that she could pursue post-conviction relief with respect to her January 6, 2006, conviction for the offense of theft, a Class A misdemeanor under Texas law (Exh. 2; Tr. at 4-5). The decision whether to grant a continuance is committed to the sound discretion of the Immigration Judge, if good cause is shown. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29 and 1240.6. Thus, an Immigration Judge’s denial of a continuance request will not be overturned on appeal unless the respondent establishes that the denial deprived her of her due process right to a full and fair hearing. See Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433 (BIA 1987). As a rule, an Immigration Judge need not hold removal proceedings in abeyance based on the mere possibility that a collateral criminal proceeding could have a future impact on the alien’s immigration status. The respondent had (and has) a valid “conviction” for immigration purposes, and her collateral attack upon that conviction does not operate to negate its validity until it is in fact overturned or materially amended. Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). We have received no indication that the respondent’s conviction has been vacated or otherwise affected by her collateral attack. Therefore, the respondent has not established that the Immigration Judge’s denial of her continuance request has compromised the fairness of her removal proceedings or resulted in prejudice. See Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354 (BIA 1983). Consequently, we find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s request for a continuance.
 
During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent’s counsel filed a motion to re-calendar the briefing schedule. While he noted that the respondent’s prior attorney indicated in her Notice of Appeal that he would not be filing an appellate brief, the respondent’s current counsel requests a copy of the transcript and an opportunity to file a brief in support of her appeal. We note that a copy of the transcript was provided to the respondent’s prior attorney, and the respondent was given until April 12, 2007, to submit a brief to the Board. The respondent had an opportunity to request an extension of the briefing schedule prior to April 12, 2007. However, her request to file an appellate brief was received by the Board more than 2 months after this deadline. We note that there are no allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel in this case. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Under the circumstances, we find it inappropriate to re-calendar the briefing schedule. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed and her motion is denied.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Linda I. Spencer-Walters
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
REISSUED DECISION
 
*1 The Board dismissed an appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying reopening on July 14, 2006. On June 1, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen that is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003. 2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “D HS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion. The Board will reopen proceedings under its sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003. 2(a), and reissue the July 14, 2006, decision.
 
The respondent alleges that her former attorney, Jose L. DelCastillo, failed to properly advise her so that she could file a petition for review with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The respondent has met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). More over, in a submission concerning the respondent’s complaint against him, former counsel reveals his lack of knowledge regarding the respondent’s appeal rights, by stating that the respondent could have filed a petition for review with the Second Circuit, as she lived in Connecticut. In fact, this case arises within the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit: “The petition for review shall be filed with the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the Immigration Judge completed the proceedings.” See section 242(b) (2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(2). In this case, the proceedings took place in Phoenix, Arizona, as an Immigration Judge there issued an order of removal in absentia, and then denied motions to reopen this decision.
 
The Board’s July 14, 2006, decision will be reissued and treated as if entered on today’s date. See Firmansjah v. Ashcroft, 347 F.3d 625 (7th Cir. 2003) (Board has authority to reissue decision).
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reissue is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated July 14, 2006, attached hereto, is here by reissued and shall be treated as entered as of today’s date.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Justin Conlon, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The Board issued its final administrative decision in this proceeding on August 31, 2006, when we dismissed the rcspondent’s appeal. On June 14, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The motion is untimely and the respondent has not demonstrated that a regulatory exception applies. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2) and (3). The respondent contends that the time limit on reopening should be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance of former counsel.
 
The motion will be denied because the respondent has not demonstrated that his former counsel, Mr. DelCastillo, provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Mr. DelCastillo was an attorney that the respondent hired to file a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Apparently, a labor certification was approved on behalf of the respondent in September 2006, and Mr. DelCastillo agreed to arrange for the filing of an I-140 employment based visa petition, which he did in October 2006, It is unclear, however, whether the respondent agreed to have Mr. DelCastillo file a motion to reopen with the Board, or entered into an attorney-client relationship for this purpose. Further, it is unlikely that the Board would have granted such a motion because the respondent’s I-140 was not approved until March 2007, long after the expiration of the 90-day time limit within which to file a timely motion to reopen.
 
In addition, in order to qualify for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i), the respondent would have to demonstrate that he was “grandfathered” by the previous religious worker visa submitted on his behalf, which was approved in 2000. However, despite this approval, subsequent events, including this Board’s affirmance on August 31, 2006, of the decision to deny adjustment of status on that petition, call into serious question whether that petition was genuinely “approvable when filed,” or was fraudulent. The mosque which filed the petition closed amidst allegations that it generated numerous fraudulent visa petitions of “religious workers.” The respondent has earned his primary income from work as a taxi driver, supplemented by teaching private students. Accordingly, at the time a timely motion to reopen could have been filed, it was speculative, and remains speculative, whether the respondent is eligible for the relief he seeks, adjustment of status. Therefore, the respondent would not have been entitled to reopening of his proceedings based on approval of the labor certificate. See Elbahjah v. Keisler, --F.3d--, 2007 WL 2935884 (2d Cir. Oct. 10, 2007)(IJ not required to continue proceedings based on speculative eligibility for adjustment of status). As such, the motion is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael Conlan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 20, 2007, to deny her motion to reopen an order of deportation entered in absentia on February 27, 1996. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that she was not adequately notified of the hearing. Former section 242B(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(a)(2), provides in pertinent part that in deportation proceedings written notice shall be given in person to the alien (or, if personal service is not practicable, written notice shall be given by certified mail to the alien) of the time and place of proceedings. Former section 242B(c)(1) of the Act states that the written notice shall be considered sufficient if provided at the most recent address provided by the alien. However, no written notice is required if an alien has failed to provide an address pursuant to the requirement set forth in section 242B(a)(1)(F) of the Act. See former section 242B(c)(2) of the Act; Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995).
 
On November 15, 1995, the Immigration Court sent the respondent the hearing notice via certified mail at 15 Hawthorne CT, #3, Aurora, IL 60506. That address is contained on a form EOIR-33 filed by the respondent on June 16, 1995. The respondent states in her declaration that she moved to Minneapolis in September 1995 and did not file a change of address form with the Immigration Court. We therefore find that the notice was proper in these proceedings because it was sent to the respondent’s last known address. The respondent was also not entitled to written notice of her hearing by failing to comply with her address reporting requirements.
 
The respondent further argues that exceptional circumstances prevented her from appearing for her hearing. She indicates that she hired an attorney prior to her hearing who had assured her that he would receive all notices on her behalf and notify her of all required appearances in the Immigration Court. According to the respondent, former counsel did not file a Notice of Appearance in these proceedings resulting in her inability to receive the hearing notice. The respondent indicates that she received a letter from former counsel dated May 16, 2007, that informs her of the order of deportation and asks whether she wanted to seek reopening. The respondent states that she authorized former counsel to do so. She further states that she was later informed by counsel’s office that her case was reopened and closed administratively with the consent of the government. The respondent indicates that she believed that her case had remained closed until she was later arrested and learned that she was subject to an order of deportation. She argues that these proceedings should be reopened based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 A motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days of the order of deportation. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this matter arises, has held that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies to the time limitations for motions to reopen during periods when a respondent is prevented from filing his or her motion because of deception, fraud, or error, provided that the respondent acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error and was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance. See Patel v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 1011 (7th Cir. 2006). Herein, the respondent charges former counsel with providing her with incorrect information regarding her immigration status and has filed a complaint against former counsel with a state bar association. The respondent has not, however, provided any evidence that she advised former counsel that he was accused of ineffective assistance of counsel before the Immigration Court and given an opportunity to respond to the motion to reopen. The declaration from current counsel states that former counsel was notified of the bar complaint to satisfy the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). He does not state that he also informed former counsel of the ineffective assistance of counsel argument raised in these proceedings.
 
In Patel v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 829 (7th Cir. 2007), the Seventh Circuit stressed the importance of notifying an attorney that his competence and integrity has been impugned to allow counsel to present his rendition of the facts. We cannot find that the respondent established that she was the victim of attorney negligence based solely on her personal accounts. It follows that the respondent has not shown that she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel and equitable tolling of the period for seeking reopening is inappropriate. The motion to reopen was filed untimely. The Immigration Judge’s decision is also affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rekha Sharma-Crawford, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joseph B. La Rocca
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s September 19, 2006, decision denying her motion to reopen and rescind an in absentia deportation order that was entered on March 13, 1997. The respondent argues that she did not receive notice of her hearing.
 
We find that proper notice was provided to the respondent. The record reflects that on February 27, 1997, the hearing notice was successfully delivered, by certified mail, to the office of the respondent’s former attorney.¿FN1º See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(b)(5)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a).
 
The respondent does not dispute that Richard A. Bimbaum was her counsel at the time of the scheduled hearing. She was aware that she was in proceedings, yet the affidavit originally provided with the motion to reopen makes no mention of any communications with Mr. Birnbaum or the immigration court regarding the status of her case after he filed the motion to change venue to New Orleans in January of 1997. The respondent provided a second affidavit on appeal. The Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995).
 
While there are some instances where we will consider new evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent was hardly diligent in pursuing such a claim.¿FN2º Her motion was not filed until more than nine years after she last communicated with her prior counsel. The rcspondent’s October 10, 2006, bar complaint states that the “reason for not following up with Mr. Richard all those years is that I was under the assumption that my case was ¿pºending.” It was not until a supplemental affidavit dated January 16, 2007, that the respondent claimed to have made any efforts to contact Mr. Birnbaum about her case. Her affidavit states that those attempts ended approximately three months after the January 1997 motion to change venue. She did not exercise due diligence by failing to make any inquiries about her deportation case for nearly a decade. Thus, even if the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit were to adopt the doctrine of equitable tolling in the Context of untimely motions to reopen in absentia orders, a favorable exercise of our discretion is not warranted in this case because the respondent did not act with due diligence.¿FN3º We affirm the result reached by the Immigration Judge because the motion is untimely.
 
*2 The appeal is dismissed.

In the Mofion to Reopen, the respondent claimed that there was no notice for the March 13, 1997, hearing in the record. A copy of the notice with the signed certified return receipt is in the record at Exhibit 6. The respondent was provided a copy of the hearing notice after filing the motion to reopen.

2

The respondent first mentioned a claim of ineffective assistance in a “supplemental motion” that was filed with the Immigration Judge on September 22, 2006. It was not mentioned in the Immigration Judge’s September 19, 2005, decision because it had not yet been received.

Her argument that she was detained and her evidence of health pxoblems do not excuse the delay, since these complications did not arise until 2006.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Matthew Guadagno, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(D), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(D)º- Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nigeria, has timely appealed the Immigration Judge’s August 13, 2007, decision. The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We adopt the procedural history set forth in the Immigration Judge’s August 13, 2007, decision. We briefly note, as set forth in the Immigration Judge’s order, that the respondent was granted voluntary departure on December 23, 2005. More than a year later, on August 7, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. He claimed that his prior counsel failed to advise him to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(b), and a Form I-751 hardship waiver. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent met the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), but failed to establish that the filing deadline for his motion should be equitably tolled. Furthermore, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent failed to submit supporting evidence to show that his children would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship, as required to establish eligibility for cancellation of removal. The respondent now appeals the Immigration Judge’s denial of his motion to reopen.
 
We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. Inasmuch as the respondent is in deportation proceedings, he is not eligible for cancellation of removal.¿FN1º Furthermore, the record indicates that the respondent filed a Form I-751 waiver, which was denied (Exh. 3). Therefore, the respondent has not shown that his prior attorney provided him ineffective assistance or that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance.
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge failed to inform him of his apparent eligibility for cancellation of removal. We recognize that an Immigration Judge is under an affirmative obligation to inform the respondent of any apparent forms of relief from deportation which may be available to him. See Matter of Cordova, 22 I&N Dec. 966, 970-71 (BIA 1999); Matter of Ulloa, 22 I&N Dec. 725, 726 (BIA 1999). Nonetheless, we note that the respondent did not make this claim in his motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge. Furthermore, we find no due process violation, as alleged by the respondent, because the respondent, who is in deportation proceedings, is not eligible for cancellation of removal.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William J. Baker, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before us on October 7, 2004, when we determined that the respondent’s appeal was untimely filed, dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, and returned the record to the Immigration Judge without further action. 8 C.F.R. §§1003.38(b), (c).
 
On August 9, 2007, the respondent filed the instant motion to reconsider the dismissal of her appeal. See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(6). The respondent seeks reinstatement of her appeal. The respondent’s motion is premised on their argument that their appeal was untimely filed due to their counsel’s ineffectiveness. See generally Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
The respondent’s motion to reconsider filed nearly 3 years after the issuance of our prior order is untimely. See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Act (a motion to reconsider shall be filed within 30 days of the entry of a final administrative order of removal). However, because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether this case warrants equitable tolling of the time limits on motions to reopen. The Ninth Circuit has held that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
We find that equitable tolling is not warranted in this case where the respondent has failed to establish that she exercised due diligence in the 3-year period sought to be tolled. The respondent’s motion is not supported by her own statement or affidavit describing her efforts to determine the status of her appeal. The respondent attached a “verification” to the motion in which she states that she has read and believes the contents of the motion to be true. According to the motion, one week after the hearing, the respondent retained Attorney Rodriguez to file an appeal on her behalf. After three months, she did not hear from him and began calling him. For six months she tried unsuccessfully to contact him at which time she gave up and decided to “wait for the attorney.” See Respondent’s Motion at 2-3. Around April 2007, she spoke with the attorney and was informed by the attorney’s secretary that her case was “impossible.” Id. The respondent does not state when she hired new counsel who informed her that the appeal was dismissed as untimely filed. Id.
 
*2 Given the respondent’s “verification” and accepting the motion as the respondent’s own statement, we find that she was on notice that there was a problem with her appeal three months after she retained Mr. Rodriguez when despite her numerous efforts, she was unable to communicate with him. She said at times “the office would even be closed.” See Respondent’s Motion at 3. It was not until two years later that she actually spoke to Mr. Rodriguez. The respondent simply failed to show that she exercised due diligence during this time. She does not state when she retained new counsel and how long it took her to file the instant motion. Although we need not reach the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because the motion is untimely filed, we add that the respondent has failed to comply with any of the procedural requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). This is not a case where the ineffective assistance of counsel is obvious and undisputed on the face of the record so that we would dispense with these requirements. Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion will be denied as time barred.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

October 19, 2007
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Arthur Evangelista, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. In a decision dated December 4, 2006, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen her deportation proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The respondent filed a timely appeal from that decision. The appeal is dismissed.
 
The respondent does not contest the fact that she was personally served with an Order to Show Cause on June 9, 1989 (Exh. 1). The respondent also concedes that on August 22, 1989, she and her counsel appeared before an Immigration Judge, and were informed she was scheduled for a hearing on November 2, 1989. This hearing was later rescheduled to March 23, 1990, and notice of the same was sent to respondent’s counsel. In her motion and on appeal the respondent contends that counsel did not inform her of either the rescheduled hearing, or that she was ordered deported in absentia on March 23, 1990. While she contended in her motion to reopen that her prior representative thus afforded her ineffective assistance of counsel, she submitted no evidence in this regard. On appeal the respondent has submitted an affidavit alleging former counsel failed to inform her of her rescheduled hearing and the Immigration Judge’s in absentia decision. She also provided a copy of a letter purportedly sent to counsel in this regard.
 
An Immigration Judge may conduct a hearing in absentia if an alien has been given a reasonable opportunity to be present at a proceeding, and without reasonable cause fails or refuses to attend or remain in attendance. Matter of Nafi, 19 I&N Dec. 430 (BIA 1987); see also Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988). Lack of notice may constitute reasonable cause for missing a hearing. See Matter of Lopez-Barrios, 20 I&N Dec. 203 (BIA 203). Moreover, the Board has held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute “reasonable cause” where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997).
 
Here, the respondent failed to submit any evidence with her motion substantiating her claim that she did not receive notice of her deportation hearing because of former counsel’s ineffective assistance. While she has submitted some evidence in this regard on appeal, the Board ordinarily will not consider evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). Moreover, we do not find that a remand in this regard is warranted. The respondent has submitted two of her own declarations and a copy of a letter purportedly sent from current counsel to her former representative in this regard. However, there is no evidence indicating that Mr. Vega was, in fact, ever served with the letter from present counsel. Moreover, the respondent states she has not complied with the requirement that she submit a complaint with the appropriate bar authorities because she “only recently discovered” she had been ordered deported in absentia and was unaware she could file a complaint, and did not know how to do so (Resp.’s Br. at 8).¿FN2º
 
*2 The respondent has not cited any regulation or precedent citing such lack of knowledge as an excuse for failing to comply with the requirements enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), nor do we otherwise find that any exists. Nor has the respondent explained how the bar complaint requirement has otherwise been “fully served by other means.” See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000). The timing of her knowledge of the alleged ineffective assistance is irrelevant to this requirement. The respondent is represented by counsel who should be able to assist her in filing an appropriate complaint, and comply with this central requirement of Matter of Lozada, supra. Given this basic deficiency, we do not find that a remand for further review of this claim is warranted. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2; see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992). Similarly, the aspect of the respondent’s motion requesting reopening to pursue an application for adjustment of status and/or NACARA relief, was untimely because it was not filed by September 30, 1996. See 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(1). We note that the result of this case is not guided by our decision in Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998), which applies to motions to reopen under section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b, not to motions to reopen under section 242(b) of the Act.
 
In sum, we agree that the respondent had proper notice of her March 23, 1990, hearing as the same had been given to her attorney of record. Consequently, the Immigration Judge did not err in declining to reopen the respondent’s deportation proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

On June 5, 2005, the respondent was convicted in the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, for the offense of transportation of an unlawful alien within the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) and (B)(ii), and was sentenced to 33 months’ imprisonment (Exh. 3). The respondent was placed into the instant proceedings with the issuance of the Notice to Appear on May 29, 2007 (Exh. 1).
 
In his July 16, 2007, decision, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and ineligible for relief from removal due to her conviction for an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(N) of the Act (I.J. at 2).¿FN1º On appeal, the respondent contends that she has been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel arguing that her prior attorney failed to zealously object to the Department of Homeland Security’s evidence of her conviction and failed to prepare proper applications for relief, e.g., an application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3). See Respondent’s Brief at 4-5 and 8. On appeal, the respondent claims eligibility for withholding of removal as a member of a “particular social group” comprised of “Mexican women who have been raped and who fear reporting the crime to the Mexican police who will not protect her.” Id. at 12-13. The respondent claims that she was raped by her former fiance. Id. The respondent also asserts that her conviction is not one for an aggravated felony. Id. at 5-7. Finally, the respondent contends that the record should be remanded so that she may apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227b(a). See Respondent’s Brief at 11-13.
 
*2 Despite the respondent’s contentions on appeal, we concur in the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the record of conviction in this case establishes that the respondent has been convicted of an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(N) of the Act. See Matter of Ruiz, 22 I&N Dec. 486 (BIA 1999) (holding that an alien who is convicted of transporting an illegal alien within the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii), was convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(N)of the Act). As a result of her conviction, the respondent is not eligible for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act.¿FN2º
 
Moreover, even if we concluded that the respondent had met the technical requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), we find that she has failed to show that any action by her former counsel in not filing a withholding of removal application prejudiced the outcome of her case. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). In this regard, the respondent has failed to set forth a valid claim for withholding of removal under the Act based upon her claimed membership in a particular social group. See Castro-Perez v. Gonzales, 409 F.3d 1069 (9th Cir. 2005) (finding that a woman, basing her claim on membership in a particular social group, who claimed that she suffered past persecution when she was raped by a man she dated and that the Honduran government would not protect her, failed to show eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal because she could not show that an agent of the government committed the rape or that the government was unable or unwilling to protect her). The evidence the respondent has submitted with her appeal does not establish that the Mexican government would be unable or unwilling to protect her and, thus, does not affect the outcome of her case; therefore, she has failed to establish that a remand is warranted for any reason. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(2007).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

The respondent applied solely for voluntary departure during her underlying proceedings.

It appears that the respondent may have confused the original charge against her which was withdrawn and the aggravated felony charge. Insofar as the respondent disputes the original charge, we find no reason to address her arguments since the charge was withdrawn.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jorge Guttlein, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
Lodged: Sec. 241(a)(1)(A), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(A)º - Inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act
  
APPLICATION: waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Act
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated June 20, 2006. On that date, we adopted and affirmed an Immigration Judge’s November 2, 2004, decision finding that equitable estoppel did not prevent the government from initiating deportation proceedings against the respondent after he was granted permanent resident status through the Special Agricultural Worker (“SAW”) program. The respondent was granted temporary resident status through that program (under section 210 of the Immigration and Nationality Act) on September 9, 1988 and was convicted on July 25, 1989, of attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance. His adjustment to permanent resident status was finalized after the conviction—on September 1, 1990. Because his previous conviction rendered him inadmissible to the United States, the Department of Homeland Security initiated deportation proceedings against the respondent.
 
In support of his July 30, 2007, motion to reopen, the respondent now states that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that his former counsel should have cited to the controlling United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit precedent Lok v. INS, 548 F.2d 37 (2d Cir. 1977) (“Lok I”), in arguing that he was eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Lok v. INS, supra, a case involving a waiver of inadmissibility submitted in conjunction with an application for adjustment of status, stands for the proposition that an alien’s 7 years of lawful unrelinquished domicile need not follow an admission for lawful permanent residence. That is, an alien could accrue “lawful domicile” without being admitted for lawful permanent residence, or prior to such an admission. See Matter of Lok, 16 I&N Dec. 441 (BIA 1978). In that case, both this Board and the Second Circuit later found that Lok’s period of residence prior to his admission as a lawful permanent residence could not count toward the 7 years required under former section 212(c) of the Act because prior to his admission, he was under an order of deportation, awaiting action on a private relief bill pending in the United States Senate. See Lok v. INS, 681 F.2d 107 (2d Cir. 1982) (“Lok II”). The respondent’s former counsel has filed a response to the allegation that she provided ineffective assistance below, and argues that Lok I does not apply to the respondent’s case because his drug-related conviction rendered him inadmissible to the United States, and, accordingly, he was ineligible for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act.
 
*2 The motion is denied as untimely, and because the respondent failed to demonstrate any ineffective assistance of counsel. A motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Although the Second Circuit, under whose jurisdiction this case arises, recognizes equitable tolling of such deadlines in ineffective assistance of counsel cases, the court held that an alien must demonstrate not only that his constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000). Here, the respondent does not explain why some 13 months passed after our last decision before he was able to discover and pursue a remedy for the allegedly ineffective assistance. The respondent appears to suggest that he learned of the basis for the ineffective assistance of counsel claim through the results of a Freedom of Information Act request. Yet, he provides no detail on this contention (except to claim, erroneously, that there is no copy of his 212(c) application in the record of proceedings), and in the end, he does not demonstrate that he pursued any available claims with due diligence. Moreover, the respondent failed to comply with the requirements for alleging ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), in that he failed to lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between him and his former attorney. The affidavit accompanying the motion to reopen does not reveal any details of the representation agreement between the respondent and his former attorney, such as any fee structure, or descriptions or dates of meetings between the two parties.
 
Moreover, we cannot on this record find that any ineffective assistance occurred. The respondent’s former attorney was justified in not relying upon Lok v. INS, supra, because there was no issue below as to the respondent’s accrual of the required 7 years of lawful residence. Rather, at issue below was the respondent’s admissibility, and, therefore, eligibility for the waiver. Below, counsel diligently advanced the argument that the respondent was eligible to apply for such relief. Although we do not agree with his former counsel’s current argument-raised in defense of the ineffective assistance claim-that the respondent’s drug conviction rendered his prior admission through SAW void pursuant to Matter of Koloamatangi, 23 I&N Dec. 548 (BIA 2003), we also do not agree with the respondent that counsel’s failure to cite to Lok I rendered her representation of him ineffective. We therefore find no justification for the late motion to reopen, and we accordingly deny the motion.

IN RE: GLADYS NNENNAYA JORDEN,BENEFICIARY OF A VISA PETITION FILED BY BOBBY HARRIS JORDEN, PETITIONER
FILE: AXX XX5 616 - HOUSTON, TEXAS
October 15, 2007
 
IN VISA PETITION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER:
 
Michael Eheman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Pauline Appelbaum
Associate Regional Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The petitioner has appealed the December 17, 2005, decision by the District Director, denying the visa petition which was submitted by him on behalf of the beneficiary, his spouse. In denying the petition the District Director referenced the Notice of Intent to Deny, which cited discrepancies in interviews between the petitioner and beneficiary. With his appeal, the petitioner submitted a motion to reopen, seeking to have new evidence considered. The motion is denied and the appeal is dismissed.
 
In visa petition proceedings, the petitioner has the burden of establishing eligibility for the benefits sought. See Matter of Brantigan, 11 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 1966). The petitioner must prove the required elements by a preponderance of the evidence. See Matter of Pazandeh, 19 I&N Dec. 884 (BIA 1989). Where the bona fides of a marriage are challenged, the petitioner must present documentary or testimonial evidence to show that it was not entered into for the primary purpose of evading the immigration laws. See Matter of Phillis, 15 I&N Dec. 385 (BIA 1975). However, we note that the failure to produce affirmative evidence of the bona fides of the marriage, by itself, is not sufficient to establish that the marriage is a sham marriage. Compare 8 C.F.R. §§ 204.2(a)(1)(iii)(B), (D) (2007) with 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(ii) (2007).
 
The parties married on July 17, 2003, and the visa petition was filed on October 9, 2003. The Department of Homeland Security Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS), held separate interviews of the petitioner and the beneficiary in November of 2004 to determine the bona fides of the marriage. See Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604 (1953); Matter of Laureano, 19 I&N Dec. 1 (BIA 1983); Matter of McKee, 17 I&N Dec. 332 (BIA 1980). Following the interviews, the District Director denied the visa petition, concluding that the petitioner failed to prove the existence of a bona fide marital relationship.
 
During the interviews, there were discrepancies between the testimony of the petitioner and the beneficiary. For example, the petitioner stated he met the beneficiary at his home in April 2004, while the beneficiary stated they met at her aunt’s home in April 2003. The petitioner also reported she had met both of his sisters, while she stated she had not met either. Moreover, the documentation provided by the parties regarding cohabitation was all created within a short time before the interviews although by that time they had been married for more than a year. None of this documentation related to the period encompassing their first year of married life. Although the parties were issued a request for further evidence detailing specific documentation needed to support the petition, they failed to adequately reply to the same. Rather, the petitioner provided only an unsworn and uncorroborated statement from his aunt, a 2001 tax return, and evidence of employment regarding the beneficiary.
 
*2 On appeal, the petitioner filed a motion to reopen, and submitted additional evidence. However, the Board has held that, where a petitioner has been put on notice of a deficiency in the evidence and has been given an opportunity to respond to that deficiency, it will not accept evidence offered for the first time on appeal. Matter of Soriano, 19 I&N Dec. 764 (BIA 1988). As noted, the petitioner failed to adequately respond to the request for further evidence. In the subsequently-issued notice of intent to deny the petitioner was informed of the perceived discrepancies between his answers and those of the beneficiary obtained at the interviews, and was again provided an opportunity to submit further evidence and respond to the same. However, the petitioner offered no response, and thus failed to rebut the noted derogatory evidence. On appeal, the petitioner submitted evidence with his motion in support of the bona fides of his marriage.¿FN1º As noted above, the Board does not accept new evidence on appeal where, as here, the petitioner previously was given an opportunity to submit such evidence. As such, the motion to reopen is denied.
 
The evidence before the District Director supports the denial of the visa petition. No satisfactory explanation for any of the noted discrepancies or evidentiary deficiencies has been provided. As such, we agree with the District Director the parties failed to demonstrate that a bona fide marriage exists. Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied, and the appeal is dismissed.
 
The petitioner may, of course, file a new petition on the beneficiary’s behalf that is supported by competent evidence that the beneficiary is entitled to the status sought under the immigration laws.

We recognize that petitioner’s counsel avers the petitioner had, in fact, provided him with documentation responsive to the Notice of Intent to Deny, but that he erroneously failed to file the same. This assertion is in the nature of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, no effort has been made to comply with any of the requirements for such a claim, including the filing of a bar complaint. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10(1st Cir. 1988). In light of this failure, and as we do not accept evidence offered for the first time on appeal, denial of the motion is warranted. For the petitioner’s benefit, we note that the evidence submitted with the motion contains the same deficiencies as that previously offered as it fails to include documentation relating to the first year of their marriage. Nor is any explanation offered for the noted discrepancies in their interviews.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rebecca L. Maxey, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Edward L. Dunlay
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on August 1, 2005, when we affirmed, without opinion, the Immigration Judge’s May 24, 2004, decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(4).
 
On May 11, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen based, inter alia, on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion, which was filed nearly two years after the issuance of a final administrative order, is untimely filed. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
However, because this case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the respondent presents an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we will consider whether this case warrants equitable tolling of the time limits on motions to reopen. The Ninth Circuit has held that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). The respondent has substantially complied with the procedural requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The respondent claims that his prior counsel, Mr. Ra Shipps, failed to timely inform him of our August 1, 2005, decision. He first learned of our decision on or about April 17, 2007, and filed the instant motion within one month. We find that the respondent exercised due diligence and that this case warrants equitable tolling. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) states that it does not oppose the respondent’s motion. It notes that if the respondent’s allegations against Mr. Shipps are true, that the respondent acted with due diligence and established that Mr. Shipps prejudiced his case. The respondent subsequently filed a statement from Mr. Shipps who accepted responsibility for failing to inform the respondent of our August 1, 2005, decision. In addition, the respondent has provided evidence that he is the beneficiary of an approved immediate relative visa petition and that he is prima facie eligible for adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1255(a).
 
*2 Based on the foregoing, we find that the respondent has established that his case should be reopened to allow him the opportunity to apply for relief from removal. The appropriate orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Regis Fernandez, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On August 13, 1998, the respondent’s proceedings were “terminated” on Form I-471, by motion of the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), to allow the respondent the opportunity to pursue an adjustment of status claim. Specifically, on the Form I-471, entitled Motion by Trial Attorney to Immigration Judge After Commencement of Deportation Hearing, the INS requested that “the deportation proceedings against the respondent be terminated to permit his case to be considered or reconsidered by the District Director.” The Form I-471 was signed by the Immigration Judge on August 13, 1998. At the bottom of the page, in fine print right above the Immigration Judge’s signature, the form explains that “if the action taken by the District Director is favorable to the respondent, the pending deportation proceedings shall be terminated; but that if the action taken by the District Director is not favorable to the respondent the pending deportation proceedings shall remain in full force and effect.” On January 10, 2003, the INS made a motion to “recalendar” the respondent’s proceedings. Therein, the motion indicated that the respondent lived at 12 Sanford Place, Apt. #106, and that his attorney, Lawrence LeRoy, Esquire, practiced at 228 Mt. Prospect Avenue. Notices of Hearing were subsequently sent out to those addresses, and on July 17, 2003, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable in absentia. Thereafter, on August 8, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, arguing that he did not appear for his hearing because neither he nor his former attorney still resided at the addresses provided in the INS’ January 10, 2003, motion. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion on August 16, 2007, stating that the Notice to Appear, dated January 30, 1998, was personally served on the respondent, and Mr. Leroy was the respondent’s last counsel of record. The respondent appealed this decision. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the pending appeal, which will be sustained.
 
The respondent now argues that neither he nor his attorney understood that they were required to continue updating the Immigration Court about their address subsequent to the Immigration Judge’s grant of the 1998 motion. The respondent argues that he moved from his address of record before January 10, 2003, and that he never received a copy of the Immigration Judge’s 2003 decision; he also indicates that he did not maintain contact with Mr. Leroy throughout the process of his adjustment application process. Lastly, the respondent states that he only recently learned that he had been ordered removed when he was detained by immigration agents in 2007, and he filed the AXX XXX XXX instant motion within a short period after his detention. The respondent requests that we remand the record to allow him a full evidentiary hearing regarding his removability.
 
*2 As an initial matter, we note that the Form I-471 used in 1998 to “terminate” the respondent’s proceedings is a form appropriate for deportation, rather than removal, proceedings. As such, the process by which the Immigration Judge administratively closed the respondent’s hearing has been misplaced from its inception. Moreover, given that the Form I-471 never employs the words administrative closure, but rather appears to request termination of the respondent’s proceeding, we find the Immigration Judge’s grant of the motion, and the respondent’s subsequent confusion regarding his status, understandable. While the fine print at the bottom of the page explains the subsequent actions that may be taken by INS, the more prominent statements on the form do not indicate the conditional nature of the termination. Lastly, we note that the Form I-471 was filed by the legacy INS, and while the respondent’s attorney signed the form itself, it is also understandable that the respondent may not have understood the effect of the motion.¿FN1º
 
Given the circumstances presented by the respondent, we herein sustain his appeal, and remand the record to the Immigration Court for further proceedings regarding the respondent’s removability and relief therefrom.

While the respondent does not argue an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the basis of his appeal is that he was under the impression that his proceedings had been terminated.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; termination
 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has appealed a decision from an Immigration Judge rescinding and reopening the respondent’s in absentia deportation proceedings, and subsequently terminating the deportation proceedings. The respondent has filed an opposition to the appeal. The appeal filed by the DHS will be dismissed.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent had a legitimate claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent contends that he was not able to file complaints against the firm Immigration Legal Options because it does not seem to exist anymore. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding that the requirements for making claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are generally reasonable, but need not be rigidly enforced). In addition, we agree that, given the DHS’s continued acceptance of the respondent’s various immigration applications throughout the years, the respondent had no actual or constructive notice of the deportation order entered against him. Moreover, given that the DHS granted the respondent’s application for advance parole, the respondent departed the United States with the express approval of the DHS, and it is reasonable to conclude that the respondent was not aware of the consequences of his departure. Given the totality of the circumstances in this case, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent is not barred by the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) from applying for a motion to reopen, and was eligible for rescission of his in absentia deportation proceedings.
 
Further, we also find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent, having returned to the United States under advance parole, is an arriving alien and no longer subject to deportation proceedings. Therefore, the Immigration Judge properly terminated the respondent’s deportation proceedings, noting that the DHS could properly place the respondent in removal proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The DHS’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patricia Vargas, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
This case was last before the Board on July 27, 2007, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The respondent now moves for reconsideration and reopening pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 (2007). The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion asks the Board to reconsider our conclusion that, on balance, his equities in the United States were insufficient to outweigh his criminal record. Specifically, the respondent argues that the Board erred in referring to his criminal record, which consists of two convictions, as “extensive.” He also suggests that we did not give sufficient weight to his equities in this country, particularly his family ties, which include his lawful permanent resident grandmother, two United States citizen parents, and two United States citizen children.
 
A motion to reconsider must include an allegation of material factual or legal error in the prior decision that is supported by pertinent authority. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). While the respondent’s criminal record may not qualify as “extensive,” it is indeed a serious adverse factor in this case, as it consists of a controlled substance violation as well as a firearms offense (I.J. at 8-9; Exhs. 2, 3). Additionally, we observed in our decision that the respondent failed to demonstrate rehabilitation, as the record reflects that he failed to appear for court-ordered rehabilitation after being convicted in December 2005 of possession of a controlled substance, to wit, cocaine, in violation of section 11350(a) of the California Health and Safety Code (I.J. at 8-9; Exh. 2). Thereafter, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest (I.J. at 14). We further note that during his removal hearing, the respondent failed to take responsibility or demonstrate remorse for his November 2006 conviction under section 12025(a)(1) of the California Penal Code for carrying a concealed firearm within a vehicle (I.J. at 15, 17). In light of these serious adverse factors, we are unable to conclude that we erred in finding that the respondent’s equities, while considerable, were insufficient to outweigh the adverse factors evidencing his undesirability as a permanent resident of the United States. See Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7, 11 (BIA 1998); Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581, 584-85 (BIA 1978). We find, therefore, that the respondent has failed to identify any error of fact or law in our previous decision.
 
*2 The respondent also seeks reopening on the basis of new evidence, including a declaration from the mother of his two children, two Western Union receipts, and a copy of his grandmother’s passport. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). He asserts that, while this evidence could have been obtained prior to his hearing, his former attorney failed to recognize the need to do so; he therefore argues that his case warrants reopening on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has submitted an affidavit concerning the details of his agreement with his former attorney, along with a complaint filed with the State Bar of California, a copy of which was apparently served on the respondent’s former counsel. Thus, the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for motions to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 824-25 (9th Cir. 2003). Nevertheless, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that the outcome of his case was prejudiced by his attorney’s actions or inaction. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Although the Immigration Judge cited the respondent’s failure to document his financial support of his children in his overall discussion of potential hardship to his qualifying relatives, it appears that the more significant consideration was the fact that the respondent had not seen the children, ages 3 and 2, since they relocated to Arkansas with their mother in June 2005 (I.J. at 13-14). Thus, even assuming the respondent was contributing to their upbringing financially, there is still insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that his removal to Honduras would exercise a significant hardship on his young children, given that he has not been a regular presence in their lives for quite some time. Furthermore, while the Immigration Judge criticized the respondent for claiming his lawful permanent resident grandmother as a dependent on his 2002 and 2003 federal income tax returns, when she apparently did not relocate to the United States from Honduras until 2004, we did not consider this to be a significant factor in our prior decision; thus, even if the respondent were able to establish that his grandmother was living with him prior to 2004, it would not affect the outcome of his case. We conclude, therefore, that the respondent has failed to show that he was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel and that he has failed to meet the heavy burden required for reopening. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider and reopen is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eric P. Lin, Esquire

Lessa N. Whatmough,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER;
 
*1 PER CURIAM, The respondent, a citizen of Honduras, was ordered removed from the United States after she failed to appear for a hearing on June 26, 2001. Over five years later, on November 16, 2006, she filed a motion to reopen supported by an affidavit which explained that when she was first released on bond she provided the address of a friend in Seattle, Washington, as her contact address and that “her friend advised me that if I received any documents from immigration he would contact me so that I would be able to show up to court and comply with my responsibilities.” She indicated in her affidavit that after she went to Seattle she maintained contact with her friend and called him every week to inquire about her court date, She stated that “¿i ºt was not until this year that I was aware that I had been ordered removed because I had failed to appear for court.” On December 29, 2006, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, finding that she had not demonstrated that she had not been provided with proper notice of her July 26, 2001, removal hearing. That decision was not appealed to the Board.
 
On May 29, 2009, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. In this motion, the respondent, claimed that she was not provided with proper notice of the removal hearing and also claimed ineffective assistance of prior counsel in preparing the first motion to reopen. The second motion includes an affidavit executed on June 8, 2007, by the person who had provided his address as the contact address for the respondent which states: “I never received any mail for ¿the respondentº at my address until late 2001 when I received a document from Immigration saying that the bond had been revoked and that I was supposed to bring ¿respondentº in to Immigration.”¿FN1º
 
The Immigration Judge denied the second motion to reopen on July 6, 2007, finding that it was number barred. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent asserts in her Notice of Appeal that the bar on successive motions to reopen should be equitably tolled because the respondent’s prior attorney negligently prepared her initial motion to reopen. The respondent indicated that a brief would be filed, but no brief has been submitted. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s second motion to reopen was number barred from consideration. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (providing that an alien may file only one motion to seek reopening of an order of removal entered in absentia).
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has not yet published a decision on whether it is proper to equitably toll either the time or number restrictions on seeking reopening if attorney negligence prevented compliance with those requirements. Even were equitable tolling appropriate in some instances involving ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has not demonstrated that prior counsel provided ineffective assistance or that the outcome of her first motion to reopen would have been altered by more effective representation. Under these circumstances, the respondent has not demonstrated that the Immigration Judge erred in denying the second motion to reopen.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

Counsel for the respondent also provided an affidavit explaining that an initial affidavit purportedly executed by the respondent’s contact person on January 23, 2007, and submitted with the second motion to reopen, contained incorrect information, and had been discovered to have been prepared and executed without the affiant’s knowledge.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
June Beack, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on February 5, 2004, at which time we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s December 20, 2002, decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen her March 7, 1997, in absentia hearing for ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion, which will be denied. A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed within 90 days of the administratively final order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent’s final order was issued in absentia on March 7, 1997, and the motion to reopen is therefore both number-barred and filed years out of time. Id.
 
The respondent argues that we should reopen proceedings based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel that she received from the attorney who represented her before the Immigration Court. The respondent concedes that she has already filed one motion to reopen based on her allegations, and we note that both the Immigration Judge and this Board found that she has failed to meet the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent now requests, three years subsequent to our last consideration of her ineffective assistance of counsel claim, that we grant her motion to reopen because she has now set forth sufficient evidence in support of her claim. However, equitable tolling of the motions deadline is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf. Chen v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 151, 154 (1st Cir. 2005); Jobe v. INS, 238 F.3d 96, 98-99 (1st Cir. 2001). The respondent does not assert an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against her second attorney, who represented her in her prior motion, and she has otherwise presented an insufficient explanation for her 10 year delay in bringing the current motion. Accordingly, she has failed to demonstrate due diligence sufficient to equitably toll the motions deadline, and the motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Glenn L. Formica, Esquire
*1 The respondent has filed a motion to reopen, following our order entered on July 24, 2007.
 
We find the contentions regarding alleged ineffective assistance of counsel to be unavailing. Litigants are generally bound by the conduct of their attorneys absent egregious circumstances. LeBlanc v. INS, 715 F.2d 685 (1st 1983); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Ineffective assistance of counsel is a denial of due process only if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his or her case. Mejia Rodriguez v. INS, 178 F.3d 1139 (11th Cir. 1999); Ramirez-Durazo v. INS, 794 F.2d 491 (9th Cir. 1986).
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be supported by: 1) an affidavit by the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; 2) a showing that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and 3) a showing that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, or if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Stroe v. INS, 256 F.3d 498 (7th Cir. 2001).
 
On the one hand, the respondent argues that the assistance provided by former counsel Kevin Hoffkins was so egregious as to prejudice his case; on the other hand, it is argued that Mr. Hoffkins’ assistance was not such as to warrant filing a disciplinary complaint. In any event, it is not explained, and it is not evident to us, how the outcome would have been any different had Mr. Hoffkins provided any different assistance. The focus of our order was whether or not the Immigration Judge’s decision not to grant a continuance was valid, and we agreed that the respondent had failed to provide good cause for a continuance. The events related by the respondent in an effort to establish ineffective assistance of counsel do not provide for a different conclusion regarding the basis for the denial of a continuance by the Immigration Judge.
 
However, it is now reported that the respondent’s approved work visa has since become current. As the respondent appears eligible for adust his status, we will remand this case to permit him to pursue such relief.
 
*2 Given the lack of adverse factors in this case, and the non-opposition to the motion, we will grant it and remand the case to afford the respondent the opportunity to pursue his application for adjustment of status.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(D)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(l)(D)(i)º - Conditional resident status terminated
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before the Board on June 7, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying her application for a waiver of the joint petition filing requirement under section 216(c)(4)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4)(B). The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of her prior counsel. The motion will be denied.
 
In her motion to reopen, the respondent maintains that she was prejudiced by her former attorney’s failure to seek a waiver of the joint petition filing requirement under section 216(c)(4)(A) of the Act, or file an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act, 8U.S.C. § 1229b(b). In addition, she argues that her prior counsel erred in failing to file a brief with the Board in support of her appeal.
 
Although the respondent has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec.637 (BIA 1988), she has failed demonstrate prejudice flowing from the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Mojsilovic v. INS, 156 F3d. 743, 749 (7th Cir. 1998); see also Pop v. INS, 279 F.3d 457, 460-461 (7th Cir. 2002). The respondent’s dissatisfaction with her former counsel’s strategy in pursuing relief is not grounds for reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309, 310 (BIA 1998). Further, the respondent has offered no evidence in her motion to establish that she would have prevailed if her former attorney had pursued these forms of relief. To the contrary, after questioning the respondent regarding potential forms of relief, the Immigration Judge concluded that she was ineligible for cancellation of removal based on her lack of a qualifying relative (Tr. at 12-17). See section 240A(b)(l)(D) of the Act. Finally, the respondent has failed to establish that the Board might have sustained her appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision had her prior counsel submitted a brief. The record reflects that the Board reviewed the Immigration Judge’s decision and affirmed the results of the decision, deeming it the final agency decision. The respondent’s motion to reopen fails to establish that the further development of the arguments contained in her Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) might have led to a different result in this matter. Based on the forgoing, we conclude that the respondent has not shown prejudice flowing from the alleged errors. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on December 18, 2006, at which time this Board summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s June 13, 2006, decision to deny the respondent’s motion to reopen his in absentia hearing on account of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has now filed a second motion to reopen, on April 17, 2007, requesting an opportunity to adjust his status based on his marriage to a United States citizen. The instant motion is both barred by regulations involving time and number limits of motions of this sort. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes this motion on the sole basis that the respondent has not provided a copy of his approved Form I-130. In response to the DHS opposition, the respondent submitted a copy of his approved Form I-130. The DHS has not further responded to the respondent’s motion. Inasmuch as there appears to be no further opposition to the respondent’s motion to remand the record to allow his pursuit of adjustment of status, we will reopen the proceedings based on our sua sponte authority, and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings regarding the respondent’s adjustment request. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373 (A.G. 2002). The DHS may present any evidence in opposition to the respondent’s request at that time.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anita Delgado, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM The respondent is a native and citizen of Ecuador who pled guilty to two separate crimes of petit larceny in New York. The respondent hired an attorney who appeared telephonically on several occasions. On July 9, 2007, the Immigration Judge attempted to contact the respondent’s attorney, but was unable to do so (Tr. at 26-27; Letter dated July 20, 2007 from Jay C. Sherman). The Immigration Judge informed the respondent that his attorney was not available and asked the respondent what he wanted to do regarding his removal case. The respondent indicated that he would “rather just sign off for a deportation order.” (Tr. at 27). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was removable as charged, and ordered the respondent removed (Tr. at 28-30). The respondent accepted the Immigration Judge’s order of removal as final and waived his right to an appeal (Tr. at 30-32). See also I.J. Dec. dated July 9, 2007.
 
On August 2, 2007, the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal. He alleges that his due process rights were violated because his former attorney provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel. He contends that the Immigration Judge should have provided him with the opportunity to obtain new counsel, and that he may be eligible for a U visa. The respondent has not substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 a 2 (5th Cir.2001). Further, the respondent has not shown prejudice resulting from former counsel’s ineffectiveness. See Ogbemudia v. INS, 988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir. 1993). The respondent did not ask for a continuance or request the opportunity to obtain new counsel. The respondent asked for an order of deportation and waived his right to an appeal. Further, the respondent does not argue that the order of removal was incorrect and has not demonstrated that he is prima facie eligible for relief from removal.
 
Since the record indicates that the respondent’s waiver was knowing and intelligent, and since the respondent has not demonstrated a basis for accepting the appeal despite the waiver, we lack jurisdiction over the instant appeal. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(G) (summary dismissal of appeal appropriate where appeal is barred based on waiver of right to appeal). See also Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jon E. Jessen, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; section 212(c) waiver
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on October 18, 2005, when we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal based upon his failure to file an appeal brief after stating in his Notice of Appeal that such a brief would be filed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E). On May 25, 2007, the respondent filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance by the attorney who represented him on appeal to the Board. We have nothing in the record to indicate that the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The motion will be granted and the record will be remanded.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), an individual may move to reopen his case but must generally do so within 90 days of the entry of the final order in the underlying proceeding. However, the 90-day filing deadline may be equitably tolled where the motion to reopen is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154 (2d Cir. 2006). In order to prevail on such a motion the movant must show that he exercised “due diligence in pursuing the case during the period ¿heº seeks to toll.” Ali v. Gonzales, 448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir. 2006); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000). A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must also meet the procedural requirements set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Finally, the movant must establish that he suffered prejudice because of his attorney’s actions or failure to act. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638. The documents submitted with the motion to reopen establish that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, and that he has shown he exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period he seeks to toll.
 
Upon review of the record before us we find it significant that the respondent was represented at his hearing by the same attorney who failed to file a timely brief during the appeal before the Board. We also find it significant that the respondent’s only criminal conviction of record occurred almost 15 years ago. Taking these factors into account, along with the lack of opposition by the DHS to the motion to reopen, we find it appropriate to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. While we conclude that the Immigration Judge properly set out the law concerning what factors should be considered and how the factors should be balanced in a section 212(c) waiver determination, we will provide the respondent with another opportunity to present evidence in support of his application. We note that one reason the Immigration Judge denied the section 212(c) waiver application previously was that the testimony and documents in the record showed that the respondent was a productive and contributing resident only during the few years prior to the 2004 hearing and the respondent did not account for other years of his residence in the United States (I.J. at 3). On remand, the respondent will be given an opportunity to account for his other years in the United States prior to the 2004 hearing, as well as for the years that have passed since the hearing. The DHS will also be given the opportunity to submit further evidence relevant to the respondent’s application for relief.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s decision dated October 18, 2005, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 28, 2004, is vacated insofar as it denied the respondent’s application for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge’s July 19, 2007, denial of his motion to reopen removal proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on March 21, 2007. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argues that the respondent’s appeal should be dismissed, and the Immigration Judge’s decision affirmed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent appeared for an initial master calendar hearing on September 13, 2006. The hearing was rescheduled until March 21, 2007, to allow time for the adjudication of a pending I-130 visa petition (I.J. at 1). The respondent and his counsel failed to appear for the March 21, 2007, hearing. An in absentia order was entered ordering the respondent removed to Niger (I.J. at 2). On May 31, 2007, the respondent’s former counsel filed a motion to reopen, and on June 14, 2007, the Immigration Judge denied the motion (I.J. at 2). A second motion to reopen was filed on June 14, 2007, by respondent’s new attorney, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen finding that the respondent had notice of the hearing, and that he failed to establish that his former attorney’s actions prejudiced his case (I.J. at 3). On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not finding that the ineffective assistance of his former counsel amounted to exceptional circumstances sufficient to rescind the in absentia order. The respondent further argues that the Immigration Judge erred in requiring that the respondent demonstrate his former counsel’s ineffective assistance prejudiced his case. See Respondent’s brief at 4-5.
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because he was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of his own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(B)(4)(iii); Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
*2 The respondent states on appeal that he did not appear for the March 21, 2007, hearing because his former counsel advised him he did not have to go back to court until his I-130 visa petition was adjudicated. The respondent argues that his former attorney’s misrepresentations amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel and should be considered “exceptional circumstances” for purposes of rescinding the in absentia order. Respondent’s brief at 4. In order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel the respondent must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Lozada, supra, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
Along with the respondent’s motion to reopen which was filed with the Immigration Judge, he also submitted an affidavit detailing the interactions with his former attorney, a letter to his former attorney requesting a response to the respondent’s affidavit, and a written request for investigation of an attorney with the attorney grievance commission for the state of Michigan. Based on this documentation, it appears that the respondent has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in requiring that he further demonstrate his case was prejudiced by his former counsel’s actions in order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. To support his argument the respondent cites to two Board decisions, over a decade old, that hold that in deportation proceedings under section 242B(c)(3) of the Act, prejudice need not be shown to obtain relief from an in absentia order. See Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599, 603 (BIA 1996); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). Section 242B(c)(3) of the Act was repealed by Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRAIRA). The respondent has not cited to any current legal authority under the applicable section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act to support his argument. Furthermore, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, where this case lies, has held that to establish ineffective assistance of counsel in order to rescind an in absentia order, a claimant must establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. See Denko v. I.N.S., 351 F.3d 717, 723-4 (6th Cir. 2003) citing Taniguchi v. Schultz, 303 F.3d 950, 958 (9th Cir. 2002) (to show ineffective assistance of counsel, a party must demonstrate that the actions of his/her attorney resulted in prejudice to the party). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
*3 We agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent has failed to demonstrate he was prejudiced by the actions of his previous counsel. See Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 1984). First, the respondent received actual notice of the March 21, 2007, hearing date in open court on September 13, 2006 (Exh. 2). The Notice of Hearing contained warnings that he could be taken into custody and/or an order may be entered for removal in his absence if he failed to appear at the hearing. The notice was personally served on the respondent and his former attorney. See Denko, supra at 725 (failure to heed prior warnings regarding attendance at hearing and neglect to confirm understanding of attorney’s instruction does not result in fundamental unfairness). Additionally, the respondent has not demonstrated that but for his former attorney’s counsel that he need not attend another hearing until his I-130 petition was adjudicated, he would be entitled to continue residing in the United States. The respondent admitted the charges of removability at the September 13, 2006, hearing. The respondent has not demonstrated that he is the beneficiary of an approved I-130 visa petition so that he is eligible to apply for adjustment of status. Finally, the respondent has not demonstrated that he is eligible or has applied for any other form of relief from removal. See Denko, supra, at 723-25.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent has failed to establish that the in absentia order should be rescinded due to exceptional circumstances. In light of our denial of the respondent’s appeal, we decline to address his further request for stay of removal. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

Christina Playton
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) º - Controlled substance violation
Sec. 212(a)(6)(C)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)º - False claim to United States citizenship
 
  
APPLICATION: Termination; cancellation of removal; remand
 
The respondent has appealed from an Immigration Judge’s written decision dated May 4, 2007. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
A central issue in this case is whether the respondent derived United States citizenship from her mother, who was born in the United States. It is undisputed that the respondent was born in Mexico in 1981. Therefore, she is presumed to be an “alien” within the meaning of section 101(a)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(3), and must come forward with evidence to demonstrate that she is a United States citizen. Matter of Rodriguez-Tejedor, 23 I&N Dec. 153, 164 (BIA 2001) (citing Matter of Leyva, 16 I&N Dec. 118, 119 (BIA 1977)). The respondent contends that she derived United States citizenship through her mother pursuant to section 309(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1409(c). That provision provides that a child born outside the United States and out of wedlock acquires the “nationality status of the mother, if the mother had the nationality of the United States at the time of ¿the child’sº birth, and if the mother had previously been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year.”
 
The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had provided insufficient evidence of citizenship to rebut the presumption of alienage arising by virtue of her foreign birth. In relevant part, he stated that the respondent’s mother, who was the only witness with direct knowledge of the dispositive facts relating to continuous presence, testified in a vague manner. The Immigration Judge stated that the testimony “lacks specificity in detail as to names, address, and most importantly dates. The Court cannot conclude that Respondent has come any where near the level of establishing by a preponderance of the credible evidence that she acquired U.S. citizenship.” I.J. at 7. The Immigration Judge later stated that he found that the respondent’s mother testified credibly “to the extent that she believed what she stated but she simply has insufficiently detailed, independent, corroborated knowledge to meet Respondent’s burden of proof as to the claim of U.S. citizenship.” I.J. at 8.
 
*2 We conclude that the Immigration Judge’s decision, as presently constituted, does not provide us with a meaningful basis for appellate review. See generally Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We are unable to ascertain the extent to which the testimony of the respondent’s mother was reliable; the Immigration Judge’s statements on page 7 as to vagueness and lack of detail imply an adverse credibility finding, but a positive credibility finding was made on page 8. Further, the Immigration Judge’s decision does not contain findings as to the credibility of a witness who testified at length with regard to whether the respondent’s mother had made inconsistent statements about her continuous physical presence in the United States. Also, the Immigration Judge did not specify what type of corroborative evidence the respondent should have presented, and did not articulate why such evidence was necessary to the burden of proof. Absent these specific findings, we are unable to assess the arguments of the parties on appeal with respect to whether the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the respondent is a United States citizen. Therefore we will remand the record for more complete findings on any disputed issues of fact. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (Board will not engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals).
 
As an independent basis for remanding this record to the Immigration Judge, we agree with the respondent’s arguments regarding ineffective assistance of counsel. In support of a motion to remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel,¿FN1º the respondent has submitted an affidavit setting forth in detail the nature of her problems with the representation by former counsel (see Declaration, dated August 21, 2007). A complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and former counsel was provided an opportunity to respond. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), qff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Former counsel’s response included an explanation that the respondent’s application for relief, which was deemed as abandoned by the Immigration Judge, was not timely filed due to poor communication and a mistake in the attorney’s office. See Respondent’s Exh. C. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded in any level of detail to the assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, because it appears that the respondent has complied with the threshold requirements pursuant to Matter of Lozada, supra, and since the respondent, as the record now stands, appears prima facie eligible for relief, the motion will be granted.
 
Finally, we find no basis to remand to a different Immigration Judge, as requested by the respondent. We have reviewed the several reasons asserted by the respondent in support of such a course of action. These reasons, taken singly or in conjunction, are insufficient to justify remand to another Immigration Judge. Over the course of these lengthy proceedings, the Immigration Judge has conducted the hearings in a generally fair way, and we see no persuasive evidence of bias on the part of the Immigration Judge, such as to require a remand to a different Immigration Judge. See Matter of G-, 20 I&N Dec. 764, 781 (BIA 1993). We note that, to the extent that the respondent complains of testimony that was stricken by the Immigration Judge (see Tr. at 94), the respondent is free to present an affidavit or other proffer of evidence to the Immigration Judge detailing the stricken testimony, and is also free to move that a new evidentiary hearing be allowed.
 
*3 For the foregoing reasons, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Termination; remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The appeal is dismissed. The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the June 20, 2007, decision of the Immigration Judge. The respondent contests the Immigration Judge’s determination that he has been convicted of an aggravated felony and is ineligible for relief from removal. The record reflects that the respondent has a Texas state conviction for burglary with intent to commit other felonies, to wit, assault in a habitation under Texas Penal Code Ann. § 30.02 (Vernon 2003). We uphold the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent has been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G) (I.J. at 2; Exh. 2). We support the Immigration Judge’s determination as consistent with Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 598 (1990) (“the generic, contemporary meaning of burglary contains at least the following elements: an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with the intent to commit a crime.”) See also United States v. Ortega-Gonzaga, 490 F.3d 393 (5th Cir. 2007) (definition of state burglary conviction for purposes of federal sentencing guidelines); cf. Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005) (modified categorical approach applicable if a divisible statute).
 
We have considered the respondent’s additional arguments on appeal and the evidence regarding the citizenship status of his family members. However, we do not find that he has demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to his removal proceedings, and we cannot consider the competence of his representation during his criminal case. Further, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established his eligibility for relief from removal, and so there is no basis to remand.

APPLICATION: Ineffective assistance of counsel; cancellation of removal
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s May 21, 2007, decision. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, g U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation. The Immigration Judge, incorporating his November 8, 2004, decision, also denied the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a), as a of discretion, and ordered him removed from the United States. The appeal is dismissed.
 
The Board reviews findings of facts by an Immigration Judge, including those as to the credibility of testimony, to determine whether the findings are “clearly erroneous.” $ C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i)¿FN1º.The Board may review all questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues on appeal from decisions of the Immigration Judge “de novo.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iii).
 
The record shows that on November 2, 2002, the respondent was convicted in the Criminal Court of New York, New York, for the offense of criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree, in violation of section 221.40 of the New York Penal Code. The respondent’s attorney, at a hearing conducted on May 21,2007, conceded that the respondent was removable for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation. The respondent argues on appeal that the professional negligence of the attorney representing him in Immigration Court deprived him of due process. The respondent avers that the ineffective assistance of counsel was reflected by the counsel’s concession that the respondent was removable (Tr. at 4). Where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is made, the Board has found that certain criteria must be met. Specifically, the claim must be supported by an affidavit of the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make, counsel must be informed of the allegations against him and provided an opportunity to respond, and the respondent must indicate whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities.  of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000) (upholding the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra).
 
*2 The United States Court.of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, held in Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir. 1994) that an alien seeking to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must show not only that counsel was ineffective, but also that the alien suffered “substantial prejudice” as a result of counsel’s errors. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553,558 (BIA 2003) (finding that the respondent had failed to show the requisite prejudice to warrant consideration of his late appeal on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel). While the respondent argues that, but for his attorney’s neglect, he would have prevailed as evidence of removability was not submitted, the record shows that respondent’s previous counsel in no way prejudiced the respondent.
 
The record, as noted above, reflects that the respondent was convicted in the Criminal Court of New York, New York, for the offense of criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree. Section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act provides that any alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation relating to a controlled substance, other than a single offense involving possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of marihuana, is deportable. We fred that, as the record showed that the respondent’s November 2002 conviction involved the criminal sale of marihuana, this conviction rendered him removable under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i). The fact that there was no showing of either the mount of marihuana or whether the sale was for remuneration is of no consequence as the respondent’s offense does not fall within the personal use exception. Accordingly, he has not identified how the actions ofhls previous counsel resulted in “substantial prejudice” to him, and his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is without merit. Absent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made before, during, or even after a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity binds his client as a judicial admission. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). Thus, the respondent is now precluded from contesting the Immigration Judge’s determination that he is removable based on that conviction.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ouyana, and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, further argues that the Immigration Judge erred when he denied the respendent’s application for cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent in this case does not merit, as a matter of discretion, a grant of cancellatiun of removal. In adjudicating an application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, the adverse factors evidencing the respondent’s undesirability as a permanent resident must be balanced with the favorable factors and social and humane considerations presented in his behalf to determine whether the grant of cancellation of removal is in the best interests of this country. Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998); Matter of Marin, 16 I&N Dec. 581 (BIA 1978). Although the respondent established that he had lived in the United States since 1981, as a lawful permanent resident, and has family ties here, we find that his continued criminal history in this country outweighs the favorable factors of record.
 
*3 Among the factors deemed adverse to an alien are the nature and underlying circumstances of the removability ground at issue, the presence of additional significant violations of this country’s immigration laws, the existence of a criminal record and, if so, its nature, recency, and seriousness, and the presence of other evidence indicative of a respundent’s bad character or undesirability as a permanent resident of this country. Favorable considerations include such factors as family ties within the United States, residence of long duration in this country (particularly when the inception of residence occurred while the respondent was of young age), and evidence of hardship to the respondent and family if deportation occurs. Additional favorable factors include service in this country’s Armed Forces, a history of employment, the existence of property or business ties, evidence of value and service to the community, proof of genuine rehabilitation if a criminal record exists, and other evidence attesting to a respondent’s good character (e.g., affidavits from family, friends, and responsible eomrnunity representatives).
 
We conclude that significant negative factors militate against a favorable exercise of discretion in this instance. His lengthy period of criminal activity includes a June 1988 conviction for unlawful possession of marihuana, an August 1989 conviction for criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree, a February 1992 conviction for criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree, a November 2002 conviction for criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree, and a May 2004 conviction for criminal possession of marihuana in the fifth degree (EOIR-42A). We also note that the respondent has testified that he has been smoking marihuana habitually for some 5 to 6 years, and has never voluntarily entered a drug treatment program (Tr. at 32).
 
The respondent has also adduced a number of countervailing equities. The respondent entered the United States in 1981 as a lawful permanent resident, although he has been involved with the criminal justice system for a substantial period of time. The respondent, who has never been married, was briefly employed for periods on 1988, 1996, and 2000 (Tr. at 12-13, 17-18). He has one United States citizen child, age 18, who lives in Miami and who the respondent has had no contact with for some 4 to 5 years (Tr. at 14-15). His mother, brother, and sister live in the United States, and the respondent, who has always lived with his mother, owns no property, and has no money or other assets (Tr. at 26-33). He has not served in the armed forces, and does not appear to have been a person of any particular value to his community at large. His application for relief is not supported by testimony, or affidavits, from family.
 
Turning to the issue of rehabilitation, we consider it to be an important factor in light of the nature of the respondent’s criminal record. The Immigration Judge, after delineating the respondent’s criminal activity, found no evidence of genuine rehabilitation, noting the lack of affidavits from family or friends attesting to the respondent’s good character (2004 LJ. Dec. at 5).
 
*4 In balancing the various factors in the respondent’s case, we take note of his favorable equities. However, when we weigh these equities against the adverse factors of his extensive history of criminal conduct, and his substance abuse, and our lack of confidence as to his rehabilitation, we must conclude that a favorable exercise of discretion would not be in the best interest of the United States in tlais instance.
 
• Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Adjustment of status; waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s May 3, 2007, decision. The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s denial of his request for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying him a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act as a matter of discretion. In evaluating whether relief under section 212(h) is warranted, we balance the adverse factors evidencing an alien’s undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented on his behalf. See Matter of Mendez, 21 I&N Dec. 296 (BIA 1996). The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge did not give sufficient weight to his claim of rehabilitation and hardship to his spouse.¿FN1º We agree with the Immigration Judge that even considering the hardship to his wife and four children, it is not in the best interest of the United States for the respondent to remain in this country (I.J. at 9-11). The respondent has an extensive and recent criminal record. For example, in 2000, he was convicted of resisting arrest (Exh. 2B). In 2002, he was convicted of burglary of a vehicle and sentenced to 100 days’ confinement (I.J. at 1; Exh. 2B). In 2003, he was again convicted of burglary of a vehicle and sentenced to 60 days’ imprisonment (I.J. at 2; Exhs. 2B, 9D). He was convicted on three occasions, including once in 2003 and 2005, of driving while intoxicated (Exh. 9D; Tr. at 45-46; I.J. at 5). Based on the foregoing, we find no reversible error in the Immigration Judge’s discretionary denial of a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act.
 
The respondent also claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The record of proceedings includes a motion to reopen and reconsider filed with the Immigration Court, in which the respondent claims that his prior counsel was ineffective. The Immigration Court lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion because the respondent’s appeal had already been entered with the Board. In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires; (1) an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the claim reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. The motion filed with the Immigration Court contains a grievance form but does not indicate that the respondent’s prior counsel was notified of the allegations. Therefore, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. Furthermore, he has not shown that he was prejudiced by his prior counsel’s alleged misconduct. See Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent has not shown that the outcome of his case would have been different but for his prior counsel’s alleged misconduct. Based on the foregoing, the respondent has not established a due process violation resulting from his prior counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent also contends that the Immigration Judge erred in not allowing sufficient testimony regarding his rehabilitation. However, the respondent does not cite examples of any instances in which the Immigration Judge prevented him from presenting such testimony. Furthermore, the respondent does not indicate on appeal how he has rehabilitated.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Georgia B. Gillett, Esquire¿FN1º
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s May 11, 2007, decision ordering the respondent removed to Trinidad and Tobago. The Notice of Appeal was filed on June 11, 2007. While the appeal has been pending, on August 9, 2007, the respondent’s counsel filed a Motion to Withdraw Appeal. The motion indicated the respondent wants to be removed as soon as possible.
 
However, on August 22, 2007, the respondent filed a note to the court indicating that he never requested his attorney to withdraw his appeal. Included in the note is a copy of a letter to the respondent’s attorney requesting the case be mailed to his mother, and stating the attorney’s services are no longer needed. The letter appears to be dated in July, but the day and year are not clear from the copy. There is also a copy of a June 20, 2007, letter to the attorney from the respondent’s mother indicating that services are no longer required and, inter alia, requesting all documents to be sent to a Mr. Sampson. There is also an August 8, 2007, letter from the attorney to the respondent indicating that, pursuant to his request, the Motion to Withdraw Appeal was filed, and documents related to an application for adjustment of status via the respondent’s wife are being forwarded, as well as other documents and the Board’s appeal briefing schedule and transcript.
 
There is no allegation of, or compliance with the procedures to establish, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, so the documents will be considered in the most logical light. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). It appears that the respondent terminated the services of the attorney by July 2007, at the latest. The appeal brief was due on August 10, 2007. The Motion to Withdraw the appeal was not filed until August 8, 2007 and this motion also indicates the respondent’s entire immigration file was forwarded to the respondent on that date. The August 8, 2007, letter from the attorney forwarding material to the respondent does not indicate, as stated in the motion, that the entire immigration file was forwarded to the respondent; just that certain documents were sent to the respondent. Notwithstanding, the respondent’s letter notifying the Board that he never intended to withdraw his appeal was timely filed, although after the due date for the brief. Given the inconsistencies in these documents, the attorney’s motion to withdraw the appeal will be denied.
 
While the motion filed by the attorney does not indicate that she wishes to withdraw from the case, in light of the respondent’s August 22, 2007, note to the Board and supporting letters, we will construe the motion as such. The motion to withdraw from the case by counsel will be granted.
 
*2 There has been ample time during which the respondent was represented by counsel to file an appeal brief, yet none was filed. No request for an extension has been received. There is no allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. Consequently, we also consider the merits of the appeal.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that he should be allowed to apply for adjustment of status via his wife because he is eligible for a section 212(h) waiver for his criminal offenses. However, the June 16, 2006, drug trafficking conviction is an aggravated felony and a 212(h) waiver is therefore not available. The respondent mentions that he is challenging the conviction in criminal court because he was not informed of the immigration consequences of accepting a plea in that case. However, there is no claim that the motion to vacate has been granted. Consequently, we are still bound by the underlying conviction. See Section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A); Resendez-Alcaraz v. United States Attorney General, 383 F.3d 1262 (11th Cir. 2004); Matter of Punu, 22 I&N Dec. 224 (BIA 1998); cf. Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006) (conviction vacated for failure of the trial court to give the alien defendant the statutorily required advisal of the possible immigration consequences of a guilty plea is no longer a conviction for immigration purposes).
 
Accordingly, the motion to withdraw the appeal is denied. The motion to withdraw as counsel is granted. The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rodel E. Rodis, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reissuance of Board decision
 
*1 This case was initially before us on March 2, 2005, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision which found the respondent removable from the United States. On December 27, 2005, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen that was rejected due to filing defects. On January 19, 2006, the respondent filed a corrected motion to reopen. On February 23, 2006, we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen because it was filed more than 90 days after the Board’s March 2, 2005, final order was entered. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
The respondent subsequently filed a petition for review of our denial of his motion to reopen with the Ninth Circuit. The government filed an unopposed motion to remand, which the Ninth Circuit granted. In its motion, the government requested that the case be remanded so that the Board may be given an opportunity to reevaluate our February 23, 2006, decision, in light of the Ninth Circuit’s recently issued decision in Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding that ineffective assistance of counsel entitled alien to tolling of filing deadline for motion to reopen), and to consider whether tolling of the motion to reopen deadline is appropriate in this case.¿FN1º
 
Upon reconsideration of our February 23, 2006, decision, we find that we must still deny the respondent’s motion to reopen, as it was untimely filed, and he has not shown that he should be exempt from the 90-day deadline for filing such a motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). In the respondent’s motion to reopen, the respondent requested that we reopen his case and reissue our March 2, 2005, decision, so that he may timely file a petition for review with the Ninth Circuit. He claims that his attorney, Ted Laguatan (“Laguatan”), was out of the country when the Board decision was issued, and Laguatan did not inform him of the decision until after the expiration of the deadline for filing a petition for review with the Ninth Circuit.¿FN2º
 
To the extent that the respondent has claimed that reopening and reissuance of his decision is warranted due to Laguatan’s ineffective assistance, the respondent has not attempted to comply with any of the procedural requirements when raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and approved by the Ninth Circuit. See Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 582 (9th Cir. 2006). In Ray v. Gonzales, supra, the Ninth Circuit has acknowledged that the procedural requirements in Lozada serve important policy goals of ensuring the legitimacy of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and in developing an adequate factual basis to adjudicate such a claim. The Ninth Circuit further recognized that there are cases when the requirements of Lozada need not be rigidly applied, such as when there is an adequate basis in the record for an ineffective assistance complaint and when the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one. See id. and cases cited therein. In support of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent’s sole submission consisted of an unsworn letter alleging, in general terms, that Laguatan gave him notice of the Board’s decision only after the expiration of the deadline for filing a petition of review with the circuit court. The respondent’s minimal submission in his motion does not satisfy the policy goals underlying the threshold procedural requirements in Lozada. The respondent likewise has not demonstrated that circumstances exist that would justify non-compliance with any of these requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to consider the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim against previous counsel.
 
*2 Because the respondent has not met the procedural requirements in Lozada, we need not consider whether equitable tolling of the 90-day filing deadline is warranted due to ineffective assistance of counsel. However, in light of the language in the government’s motion to remand, we will further address the issue of equitable tolling. Even assuming arguendo that we can consider the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel despite his failure to comply with the Lozada requirements, we have not been provided with a sufficient basis upon which to conclude that equitable tolling should be applied in his case. The respondent has not identified, either in his motion letter or on remand, what period of time he seeks to toll. His letter does not indicate when he was made aware of the Board’s decision, and/or Laguatan’s alleged negligence. The respondent has neither claimed nor demonstrated that he exercised due diligence in filing the present motion to reopen as required to establish eligibility for equitable tolling. See Ray v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d at 589, fn. 5 (finding that alien who acted with diligence in filing his claim after learning of counsel’s ineffectiveness was entitled to equitable tolling of the filing deadlines); see also Valeriano v. Gonzales, 474 F.3d 669 (9th Cir. 2007); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
After reevaluating the respondent’s motion to reopen in light of the Ninth Circuit’s case in Ray v. Gonzalez, supra, and the government’s motion to remand, we are unable to conclude that the respondent has adequately demonstrated that his untimely motion to reopen should be granted. We likewise note that the respondent has not argued nor has he adequately shown that exceptional circumstances warrant the exercise of our limited authority to sua sponte reopen his proceedings. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). In view of the foregoing, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

The respondent has not alleged that the Board’s decision was not properly mailed to Laguatan. See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). He has not alleged that any administrative error at the Board resulted in a defect of service of the March 2, 2005, decision.

DISSENTING OPINION:
Roger A. Pauley
*1 I respectfully dissent. I would find that the respondent is bound by the concession of his attorney that the battery offense was a crime involving moral turpitude. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N dec. 377, 382-3 (BIA 1986). The fact that, in retrospect, the concession may be shown to have been ill-advised does not mean that the respondent can escape its consequences, particularly in the absence of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).

APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on June 19, 2007, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b, as a matter of discretion. In addition, we concluded that the respondent is ineligible for Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) because of her criminal record. See section 244(c)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(c)(2)(B)(i). We also rejected the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim finding that the respondent the had not sufficiently shown patent error or complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Zheng v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005). Finally, we noted that the respondent’s newly offered evidence on appeal was not sufficient to warrant a remand. The respondent has timely filed a motion requesting reopening and reconsideration. The respondent has not identified any error of fact or law in our previous detailed decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b) (2007); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24-I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). Furthermore, the respondent’s motion fails to comply with both the statutory and regulatory requirements for reopening. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent has not submitted or identified additional evidence demonstrating that further hearings are warranted. See Matter of S-V-, 22 I&N Dec. 1306, 1307-1308 (BIA 2000); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied and, as a result, the respondent is ordered removed to El Salvador.¿FN1º

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert L. Oswald, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)º - Convicted of crime involving moral turpitude
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
  
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
 
The respondent appeals the February 14, 2006, decision of an Immigration Judge finding that the respondent had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude and of an aggravated felony, under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F), that he, therefore, was removable, as charged, and denying the motion to terminate. The appeal will be sustained.
 
The respondent is a 61-year-old native of India and citizen of Pakistan, who was admitted to the United States on or about June 9, 1992, as a lawful permanent resident. The respondent’s record of conviction, admitted into evidence below, demonstrates that on February 9, 1998, the respondent was convicted on a plea of guilty of battery committed on May 17, 1997, in the Circuit Court of Mercer County, West Virginia, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months for that offense (Exh. 2). The execution of the sentence was suspended and he was placed on probation. He was released from probation and the remainder of the sentence was suspended on August 6, 1998. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) charged the respondent with being subject to removal from the United States based upon that conviction, asserting that the respondent is removable under sections 237(a)(2)(A)(i) and (iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1237(a)(2)(A)(i) and (iii), as an alien who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within 5 years after the date of admission and of an aggravated felony at any time after admission into the United States. The DHS alleged that the respondent’s conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Act, because it constitutes a crime of violence for which the respondent was sentenced to at least 1 year in prison. The Immigration Judge ruled that because the respondent was convicted of a battery that involved the intentional infliction of harm, it constituted an aggravated felony and that the charging documents demonstrated he had committed a crime involving moral turpitude.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that battery in the State of West Virginia under W.Va. Code § 61-2-9(c) is a misdemeanor, and as such cannot be an aggravated felony under section 16(b) of title 18 United States Code. The Immigration Judge found he was not convicted of an aggravated felony under title 18 section 16(b) of the United States Code. The respondent further argues that his conviction is not for a crime of violence under title 18 section 16(a), because it does not involve the use of force as an element of the crime. One commits the crime of battery under West Virginia Code § 61-1-9(c): “¿iºf any person unlawfully and intentionally makes physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature with the person of another or unlawfully and intentionally causes physical harm to anther person, …” The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in which this case arises, has held that when a definition of a crime is ambiguous and will not necessarily provide the answer as to whether a particular conviction is for a “crime of violence,” it is permissible to look beyond the definition of the crime to examine the facts contained in the charging document on which the defendant was convicted. See United States v. Kirksey, 138 F.3d 120, 124 (4th Cir.), cert denied, 525 U.S. 849 (1998).
 
*2 Because the intentional employment of physical force against a person or thing is not an “element” of this offense, the offense is not a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. § 16(a). Even if the respondent had pled guilty to the portion of the statute criminalizing unlawfully and intentionally causing physical harm to another person, he would not necessarily have used force to cause that harm. See Leocal v. INS, 543 U.S. 1 (2004). Moreover, the statement of charges does not refer to any degree of harm such as pain or bruising and it is not clear from the record that the respondent was not found guilty of “physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature.” Accordingly, he was not convicted of an aggravated felony.
 
The Immigration Judge found that battery in this case was a crime of moral turpitude. The respondent admitted through counsel that he was convicted of a crime of moral turpitude (Tr. at 8); however, the Immigration Judge relied on the record of conviction to find the respondent was convicted of a crime of moral turpitude and the respondent has disputed that finding on appeal. The respondent has not claimed ineffective assistance of counsel in regard to the admission made by counsel. Nevertheless, as this issue was adjudicated below, we will consider whether the record supports the Immigration Judge’s finding.
 
“It is the inherent nature of the crime as defined by statute and interpreted by the courts and as limited and described by the record of conviction which determines whether the offense is one involving moral turpitude.” Matter of Short, 20 I&N Dec. 136, 137 (BIA 1989). When the statute includes some offenses which involve moral turpitude and some which do not, we look to the record of conviction (indictment, plea, verdict, and sentence) to determine the offense of which he was convicted. Id. He was originally charged with first degree sexual assault. The conduct described in the criminal complaint would readily meet the definition of crime involving moral turpitude. In this case, the respondent pled guilty to the lesser included offense of battery and the recitation of facts included in the criminal complaint in support of another charge cannot be used to demonstrates that the respondent was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. See Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, 468 F.3d 1159 (9th Cir. 2006). Therefore, we cannot agree that the respondent was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude on the record before us.
 
Based on the foregoing, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained; the respondent is found not removable.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The order of removal is vacated and proceedings are terminated.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mayra Joli, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered removed from the United States on October 10, 2006, because he failed to appear for a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on March 30, 2007. Therein, the respondent argued that he did not receive the Notice of Hearing. We note that he was personally served with the Notice to Appear that advised him of the requirement to provide his most updated address with the Immigration Court. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on May 16, 2007. The Immigration Judge noted that the hearing notice was mailed to the address reflected on the Notice to Appear, 11521 NW 10 Street, Pembroke Pines, Florida 33026, and the respondent had provided no evidence to establish that he did not receive the notice. On May 18, 2007, the respondent requested reconsideration before the Immigration Judge. Therein, the respondent indicated that he had filed a complaint against his former counsel, and counsel’s negligence caused his failure to appear for the hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion on June 21, 2007, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
A motion to reconsider is a request that the Board or an Immigration Judge reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked. Matter of Ramos, 23 I&N Dec. 336, 338 (BIA 2002) (quoting Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 n.2 (BIA 1991)). A motion to reconsider challenges the original decision and alleges that it is defective in some regard. Matter of Cerna, supra, at 402. A motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based on the previous factual record, as opposed to a motion to reopen, which seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence. Id. at 403; see also section 240(c)(7)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) and Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that it was correct to deny reconsideration based on the record that existed when the motion to reopen was adjudicated. The Notice of Hearing was mailed to the respondent’s last known address, and the respondent failed to establish in the reconsideration request that the Immigration Judge erred in this determination. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny reopening.
 
We further note that the respondent argued in his motion to reconsider that attorney negligence may have caused his failure to appear. We characterize this argument as a request for reopening based on exceptional circumstances rather than an argument pertaining to lack of notice. A request for rescission of an order of removal based on exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. Because a request for reopening based on exceptional circumstances was not made within 180 days of the date of the respondent’s order of removal, it is barred from consideration. In addition, we characterize the respondent’s motion to reconsider as a second request for reopening. Under the regulation, an alien may only file one motion to reopen an order of removal entered in absentia. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
 
*2 We would also deny reopening notwithstanding the above bars. Initially, we note that it is unclear if the respondent notified his prior counsel that he had accused him of ineffective assistance of counsel, and allowed him an opportunity to respond to the motion. Dakane v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005); Gbaya v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 342 F.3d 1219 (11th Cir. 2003) (noting that it is required that an alien establish substantial if not exact compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988)). The respondent indicates that his current attorney advised former counsel of the accusation, but we note no evidence that clearly indicates that such notice was given. Even if the procedural requirements for proving ineffective assistance of counsel were established, we cannot find that counsel was negligent in these proceedings. The respondent states in his declaration that former counsel advised him that he need not appear in court until he received the Notice of Hearing. Such advice appears to be proper. We cannot ascertain from the record any evidence that former counsel suggested that the respondent need not appear for the hearing after he received the notice. The respondent presumably received the Notice of Hearing, and he was under an obligation to appear. His failure to do so has not been shown to be the result of attorney negligence.
 
We further cannot grant the respondent’s motion to reopen that was filed with the Board on August 20, 2007. Therein, the respondent has submitted an order from the criminal court that shows that his motion to vacate his plea on the charge of possession of cannabis was granted on August 6, 2007. It is unclear whether the criminal court did so for substantive or rehabilitative reasons. Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003) (if a court vacates an alien’s conviction for reasons solely related to rehabilitation or immigration hardships, rather than on the basis of a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the conviction is not eliminated for immigration purposes). Even if the respondent’s conviction was vacated for substantive reasons, he remains convicted of attempted burglary of a structure that rendered him removable from the United States under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act. Inasmuch as the respondent is a removable alien, we see no reason to terminate these proceedings or remand the record to determine the reason why the criminal court vacated his possession of cannabis conviction. The motion is denied.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thomas A. Lappin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kristin Piepmeier
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent was ordered deported from the United States on March 3, 1998, because she failed to appear for her hearing. She filed a motion to reopen on April 23, 2007, but the Immigration Judge denied it on May 23, 2007. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that she was not adequately notified of the hearing. However, as noted by the Immigration Judge and the respondent on page 2 of her brief, a Notice of Hearing sent to an alien’s attorney of record is proper notice. See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5; Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (1985). In these proceedings, the respondent received personal service of the Order to Show Cause and her former attorney was sent the hearing notice via certified mail. It also appears that an individual received the Notice of Hearing on behalf of the respondent’s counsel as evidenced by the signature on the Form 3811. The signature is illegible, but we will presume that it was received by former counsel or someone acting on his behalf. Inasmuch as the respondent received the charging document and her counsel received the hearing notice, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent was properly notified of the hearing.
 
The Immigration Judge further found that reopening of these proceedings based on exceptional circumstances was inappropriate because the motion was filed untimely, and the respondent had not pursued with due diligence reopening after learning that she was a possible victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Albillo-DeLeon v. Gonzales, 410 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir.2005) (the limitations period is tolled until the petitioner “definitively learns”of counsel’s fraud) ;Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003). The Board will generally presume that an alien learns of counsel’s negligence on the day alleged in the alien’s statement or affidavit. See Ghahremani v. Gonzales, —F.3d—, 2007 WL 2332069 (9th Cir. 2007) (noting that the Board must accept an alien’s statement regarding when he learned that he may have been the victim of attorney negligence unless the representation is unbelievable). Herein, the respondent indicates in her statement that she learned in 2000 that she was subject to an order of deportation when she attempted to renew her application for a work permit. According to her statement, she was confused by the information because she did not know that an Immigration Judge had ordered her deportation. She indicated that she consulted some attorneys, but was advised to just wait and see what happened. The respondent further indicated that she consulted her former attorney, and he could not explain why she was not notified of her hearing.
 
*2 Based on this scenario, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not seek reopening with due diligence. Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2007). The respondent consulted with counsel in 2000 and was aware that she was subject to an order of deportation. She apparently chose to ignore her immigration status possibly under the hope that the government would not seek to deport her from the United States. The Immigration Judge correctly refrained from equitably tolling the period for seeking reopening. The Immigration Judge was also correct to find that the request for reopening based on exceptional circumstances was untimely. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: ALVARO DAVID DELGADILLO
FILE: AXX XX9 548 - DENVER, CO
August 28, 2007
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Laura L. Lichter, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Special motion to reopen to seek 212(c) relief
 
*1 This case was last before us on April 30, 1998, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent ineligible for relief from deportation. On May 14, 2007, the respondent filed the instant “Special Motion to Reopen to Seek 212(c) Relief.” The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not submitted a response to the respondent’s motion. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
As recognized by the respondent, his present motion is untimely, as a special motion to reopen to file for 212(c) relief must have been filed on or before April 26, 2005. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(h). The respondent seeks to overcome the untimeliness of his motion by claiming that the ineffective assistance of prior counsel, L. Ari Weitzhandler (“Weitzhandler”), aggravated by his unavailing consultations with immigration attorneys, Philip Alterman (“Alterman”) and Jeff Joseph (“Joseph”), caused the delay in the filing of his present motion to reopen. We are unable to consider the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as he has not complied with the procedural prerequisites as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA). While the respondent submitted a printout which purports to show that a letter was sent to an “Ari” via e-mail, we do not find that this is sufficient indication that Weitzhandler was properly notified of the allegations leveled against him by the respondent. The respondent, for instance, has not provided any evidence linking the generically-named e-mail to Weitzhandler, or any evidence that Weitzhandler received this e-mail or any notification. Likewise, there is no evidence, apart from counsel’s bare assertion in the motion, that a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Id. We note that statements of counsel regarding whether a bar complaint was filed, and whether former counsel was notified of the allegations, are not evidence (Motion at 4-5). See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984); Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980).
 
Moreover, to the extent that the respondent has implied that Alterman’s and Joseph’s conduct prevented him from becoming aware of Weitzhandler’s alleged misfeasance and contributed to the delay in the filing of the present motion to reopen, we note that the respondent has not filed a claim of ineffective assistance against these attorneys pursuant to Matter of Lozada, supra. Absent such a claim, and in the absence of any other evidence that would otherwise corroborate the respondent’s assertions with regard to these meetings, the nature and the substance of his conversations with these attorneys, including what these attorneys may have represented to him that “lulled ¿himº into a sense of security,” we do not find there is a sufficient reliable basis upon which we can conclude that the respondent’s actions following these alleged meetings with these attorneys were reasonable under the circumstances.
 
*2 In addition to his failure to comply with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, we are also unable to find that the respondent has shown that he exercised due diligence as required to warrant equitable tolling of the April 26, 2005, filing deadline of this motion. Although the respondent claimed that he began to be concerned about Weitzhandler’s unavailability as early as September 2004, he did not retain another attorney to take his case until 2007. The respondent claims that he contacted attorney Alterman and told him that Weitzhandler was not returning his phone calls. Despite the respondent’s difficulties in reaching Weitzhandler, Alterman apparently succeeded in contacting Weitzhandler himself. The respondent alleged that Alterman told him, after speaking to Weitzhandler, that “it sounded like the motion was simply pending” and that if the respondent wished that he take his case, the respondent needed to get his file from Weitzhandler. The respondent claimed to have gone to Weitzhandler’s office multiple times, but the office was always locked. In reviewing the respondent’s affidavit, we are left with the question as to why, knowing that Alterman had the means and the ability to reach Weitzhandler, the respondent did not press upon Alterman to contact Weitzhandler in order to obtain his file. It is likewise unclear as to why, although he called Weitzhandler’s office “15-20 times” throughout 2005 without receiving any response, and given Weitzhandler’s alleged behavior in September of 2004, the respondent did not retain the services of another attorney to handle his case in 2005, or after he was informed that Weizhandler was “no longer practicing law” in 2006.
 
As such, because the respondent has neither complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, for claims involving ineffective assistance of counsel, nor has he established that equitable tolling should be applied in his case, we will deny as untimely filed the respondent’s special motion to reopen for 212(c) relief. See Infanzon v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 1359 (10th Cir. 2004). In view of the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
