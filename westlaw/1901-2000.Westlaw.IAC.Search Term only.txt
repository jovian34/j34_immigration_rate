APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Emilio Amaya
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal is untimely. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was rendered orally on November 5, 2004. The appeal was accordingly due on or before December 6, 2004. The record reflects, however, that the Notice of Appeal was mailed after the due date and filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on January 14, 2005. We accordingly find that the appeal is untimely. In conjunction with the appeal the respondents claim ineffecitve assistance of counsel, asserting that prior counsel failed to file their appeal. However, the respondents have failed to meet the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), in order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondents have failed to submit a detailed statement of their agreement with Fred Browne, there is no evidence that the respondents informed prior counsel of the allegations against him, and it does not appear that the California Bar complaint was actually filed1. Nor have the respondents established that they were prejudiced by any ineffective assistance of counsel. See Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000), amended by 213 F.3d 1221 (9th Cir. 2000). Therefore, we do not find this claim to be an adequate reason to consider this appeal by certification. The Immigration Judge’s decision is therefore now final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.
 
We note that because we have dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J- J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Steven R. Espinoza, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julia C. Chimarusti
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (both respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Remand; cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(b) of the Act
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondents have appealed the Immigration Judge’s September 25, 2003, decision to deny their request for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The respondents argue that we should remand the record because of their prior counsel’s ineffective assistance. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639, we held that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the claim reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not.
 
The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the respondents’ motion because there is no evidence that the respondents’ former counsel has been informed of the charges against her and given an opportunity to respond. The respondents contend, by way of a vague declarative statement, that they notified their prior counsel of the charges by telephone.
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the circuit in which this case arises, recently issued a decision regarding Lozada’s notice requirement. In Reyes v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2003), the alien sent a letter regarding the ineffectiveness of the alien’s prior counsel to the California State Bar. The letter included a line stating “cc” and the prior counsel’s name. Reyes v. Ashcroft, supra. The court observed that the “cc” notation, at best, indicated that the alien intended on sending the prior counsel notice of the state disciplinary proceedings, but that the respondent offered no evidence that he sent the prior counsel notice of the state disciplinary proceedings. Id. at 1131. Furthermore, the court noted that the alien failed to give the prior counsel notice of his motion to reopen. Id. at 1131-1132. The court emphasized that the purpose of Lozada’s notice requirement is to encourage the prior counsel to contest the allegations of ineffective assistance so that the adjudicator can more accurately assess the claim of ineffective assistance. Id. at 1132. Inasmuch as the alien provided no evidence that the prior counsel received the notice of the motion to reopen and did not give the prior counsel an opportunity to respond to the allegations, the court held that the alien failed to comply with Lozada’s notice requirement. Id.
 
*2 In the instant case, neither the respondents’ letter to the disciplinary authorities nor any affidavit from the respondents themselves or their current counsel indicate that a copy was sent to the respondents’ prior counsel. We also note that the respondents have not provided an affidavit regarding any communications with their prior counsel. Therefore, we find that the mere assertion that notice was given without any other evidence is insufficient to establish that the respondents substantially complied with Lozada’s notice requirement. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, supra. Inasmuch as the respondents do not appeal any other portion of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the appeal is dismissed and the motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondents are permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS, formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondents fail to so depart, the respondents shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondents fail to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondents shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: DAVINDER PAUL
File: AXX XX3 114 - Los Angeles
March 7, 2005
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Helen A. Sklar, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on August 16, 2002, when we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s applications for relief. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen these proceedings. The motion is denied.
 
We find that the respondent’s motion to reopen, filed on November 15, 2004, is untimely. Motions to reopen removal proceedings must be filed within 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). In the present case, this Board rendered the final decision in these proceedings on August 16, 2002. Therefore, under the strict language of the regulations, the respondent’s motion was due no later than November 14, 2002. However, we acknowledge that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies to the time limitations for motions to reopen or reconsider during periods when a respondent is prevented from filing his motion because of deception, fraud, or error, provided that the respondent acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
The respondent argues that the time limitation on his motion to reopen should be tolled due to ineffective assistance of counsel before the Immigration Judge and the Board. In the present case, the respondent was represented by Surjit Singh during his removal proceedings. After the Board’s decision of August 16, 2002, the respondent hired new counsel, Vera A. Weisz, who filed a Petition for Review with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on September 16, 2002. This petition was denied on June 23, 2004. Subsequently, the respondent hired present counsel on August 17, 2004, who filed the motion on November 15, 2004, claiming that the respondent received ineffective assistance from his prior counsels.
 
Although the respondent claims that his applications for relief were denied solely because Mr. Singh failed to prepare the respondent for the removal hearings and failed to obtain additional corroborating evidence, a review of the record indicates that the asylum application was denied due to inconsistencies and omissions in the respondent’s testimony, which led to an adverse credibility finding in this case (I.J. at 11-12; 16). In addition, the respondent testified that he was unable to obtain some of the corroborating evidence because it was not available to him (I.J. at 18). After our affirmance of the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent was on notice that the evidence he submitted in support of his claim was deficient. The respondent did not raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against Mr. Singh until after the Petition for Review had been denied by the Court of Appeals, and he realized that his attorney’s tactical approaches failed. We find that it is inappropriate to toll the statute of limitations under these circumstances. Therefore, we conclude that the respondent’s motion was untimely. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra; see also Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999).
 
*2 Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.

IN RE: TCHERNO DJAMUGUE

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ashley Mammo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Richard VanVeldhuisen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on May 24, 2004, when we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision dated March 20, 2003, for failure to file a brief in accordance with 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(D). On January 12, 2005, the respondent filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of his first attorney due to that counsel’s failure to file an appeal brief, and requesting reopening on the basis of changed country conditions in Guinea. The motion to reopen will be denied.
 
First, the motion to reopen is untimely. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on May 24, 2004. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before August 24, 2004. The record reflects that the respondent’s motion was filed on January 12, 2005. Consequently, the respondent’s motion is not properly before us for consideration. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
Second, even assuming arguendo we assumed jurisdiction, the motion would be denied. We consider that although the respondent has generally complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), he has not shown that his former counsel acted ineffectively. He argues that his former counsel was obligated to file the appeal brief and provided ineffective assistance when he failed to do so. The Board, however, has held that satisfying the above procedural requirements is in and of itself an insufficient reason to reopen, and that an attorney’s failure to file an appeal on behalf of an alien is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Id. This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id.
 
The respondent has failed to identify the substantive arguments he would have raised on appeal but for counsel’s ineffectiveness which prevented him from fully presenting his appellate arguments. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226 (9th Cir. 2002) (ineffective assistance of counsel is a due process violation if the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his or her case due to fundamental unfairness of the proceedings). Consequently, although the respondent has generally met the requirements of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Matter of Lozada, supra, he has not shown that he suffered prejudice that affected the outcome of his case. See Matter of Assaad, supra.
 
*2 Finally, we find that the respondent has not proffered any material new evidence that was previously unavailable, as to changed country conditions in Guinea, or in any other regard, in support of his motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1242.22, 1003.2, and 1003.8. Moreover, he has not supported his motion with any applications for relief from removal and deportation, including asylum, and has failed to establish prima facie eligibility for the relief requested. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 470-474 (BIA 1992).
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David Swaim, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sabrina Hall,
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves to reopen and remand the proceedings for consideration of an application for adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion. Although this motion is untimely, the respondent submits it should be excused from the usual time limitations because she had ineffective assistance of counsel from attorney Daniel W. Son, Jr. Although the respondent has included with this motion a detailed affidavit stating what problems she encountered with her former attorney, a copy of the letter her current attorney wrote to Mr. Son, and Mr. Son’s reply letter, she also contends in this motion that she cannot fully comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). She explains that the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure prohibit any disclosure about whether a claim has been filed. Motion to Reopen at 7.
 
Holding aside the fact that this motion already appears to compromise the respondent’s interpretation of the Texas rule stated above, we find that the respondent has failed to prove she was prejudiced by Mr. Son’s representation. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). See also Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999). The evidence does not prove her prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. As an initial matter, the record does not contain a copy of the I-130 that was filed on the respondent’s behalf or an application for relief (I-485). Further, the qualifying marriage took place during proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 245.1(c)(9). Finally, there is an adverse credibility finding in the record, bearing on discretion (I.J. at 6). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Accordingly, we hold that reopening is not warranted.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Section 212(c) waiver
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on October 26, 2000, when we affirmed the Immigration Judge’s December 8, 1998, decision finding the respondent removable as charged, and statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal. The respondent now moves the Board to reopen his case pursuant to recently issued regulations allowing special motions to seek relief under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (repealed 1996), for aliens who pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to certain crimes. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44.1 The respondent argues in his motion that, because he entered his plea agreement in February 1997, he is eligible to seek relief under 212(c) of the Act. The regulations, with certain exceptions not here applicable, specifically bar section 212(c) relief to an alien who has been charged and found removable on the basis of an aggravated felony. See 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(f)(4). The respondent was charged and found removable on the basis of an aggravated felony, and he has not shown that his plea agreement was made prior to April 24, 1996. Accordingly, the respondent is ineligible for a section 212(c) waiver and the motion to reopen is denied.

While the respondent, in a supplemental brief, requests that, in adjudicating his special motion to seek relief under section 212(c), we consider his arguments as to whether the Immigration Judge’s decision was in error, proceedings pursuant to special motions to seek relief under section 212(c) are solely for the purpose of adjudicating the application for section 212(c) relief. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(e).
Further, in his original appeal, the respondent did not dispute that his crime was an aggravated felony under the amended aggravated felony definition. Importantly, there are substantial indications in the record that the conviction was for residential burglary and the respondent has not complied with our requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. For us to even consider entertaining an untimely motion as to removability, the respondent would need to make an affirmative showing that his conviction would not be deemed an aggravated felony, such as by proffering his plea transcript showing that this burglary was not of a residence. See Matter of Beckford, 22, I&N Dec. 124 (BIA 2000).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Claudia Slovinsky, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Susan Egan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying a motion to reopen on July 30, 2003. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board on November 9, 2004. A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
Underlying the motion is a claim of ineffective assistance of the respondent’s former counsel. However, we cannot excuse the lateness of the motion in this case. In Iavorski v. INS, 124, 127, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000), the court suggested that the filing deadline for motions with the Board may be tolled based on deceptive actions of counsel. However, such tolling is unavailable when a party fails to exercise due diligence on his own behalf. See Tho Dinh Tran v. Alphonse Hotel Corp., 281 F.3d 23, 36-37 (2d Cir. 2002). Here, the respondent fails to show that he exercised diligence in pursuing his rights. The pending motion was filed over a year and 3 months after our last decision in the case. The respondent, while complaining about counsel who represented him at the time of our last decision, does not argue that counsel failed to inform him of that decision. Moreover, the respondent does not state when he consulted current counsel (Respondent’s Mot., at p. 21; Respondent’s Affidavit, at ¶ 25).
 
In any event, we will not favorably exercise our discretion, where the respondent failed to report for removal as ordered. In its opposition to reopening, the DHS states that the respondent was ordered to report for removal on July 11, 2000, but he did not appear. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 257 (BIA 1985) (finding that an alien in deportation proceedings who fails to report to the Service following notification to report for immediate deportation does not merit the favorable exercise of discretion required for reopening); see also Bar-Levy v. INS, 990 F.3d 33, 35 (2d Cir. 1995)(holding that an alien who had failed to surrender for deportation was a “fugitive from justice” and was barred as a result of his fugitive status from calling upon the resources of the court to examine his claims). Counsel states in a letter that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel during this period. However, there is nothing from the respondent himself to indicate that he reasonably thought that he could ignore the order to report for removal. The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent now appeals from the Immigration Judge’s denial of her application for cancellation of removal. See section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). Based on the respondent’s credible testimony and the statements on her written application, we reject the Immigration Judge’s finding that she failed to satisfy the “good moral character” requirement for the relief. See sections 240A(b)(1)(B) of the Act. See also Vera- Villegas v. INS, 330 F.3d 1222, 1225, 1230-31 (9th Cir. 2003). For the reasons set forth in the decision, however, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent failed to sustain her burden of proof with regard to the “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” requirement for the relief. See sections 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The respondent further contests the fairness of the removal hearings based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. She has failed, however, substantially to comply with the procedural requirements for such a claim. See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, 320 F.3d 1061(9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). She has also failed to put forth arguments and evidence to demonstrate that she suffered prejudice as a result of the attorney’s alleged mishandling of her case. See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, supra. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the alien fails to so depart, the alien shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated December 16, 2004.1 In our prior decision, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“the Act”), 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b), based on the fact that the respondent did not have a qualifying relative for purposes of section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act. The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
In his motion, the respondent contends that he does, in fact, have a United States citizen child but did not believe that he could claim the child as a qualifying relative because the respondent’s name was not correct on the child’s birth certificate. In support of his motion, the respondent has submitted a copy of the child’s birth certificate, which lists the respondent’s name as “Luis Ibarra Vasques,” rather than “Jose Luis Ibarra Vasquez.” The respondent maintains that he has filed an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his prior attorney as a result of this error.
 
We find that the respondent has failed to establish a basis for reopening proceedings. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Specifically, the respondent has failed to establish that the evidence he seeks to offer was not available and could not have been discovered or presented during proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Moreover, we do not find the respondent’s explanation that he did not believe he could claim the child due to the discrepancy on the birth certificate to be reasonable, particularly in light of the fact that the respondent was specifically questioned by the Immigration Judge as to whether he had any United States citizen children. See Tr. at 7-8. Furthermore, as the respondent has not alleged any specific hardship to the United States citizen child, he cannot establish prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Act. See generally INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
Turning to the respondent’s claim against his former counsel, we find that the respondent has not meaningfully attempted to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See generally Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000). The only evidence that the respondent has even attempted to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, is a copy of a complaint form purportedly filed with the State Bar of California. The complaint form, however, is incomplete and does not describe the nature of the respondent’s complaint against his former counsel. Furthermore, the respondent has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by the actions of his former counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra. The respondent has not claimed that his prior counsel was even aware of the existence of his alleged United States citizen child, nor has he claimed that he was advised by prior counsel not to reveal the existence of the child as a result of the error on the birth certificate.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

Although the respondent characterizes his motion as a motion to reconsider, the motion is, in substance, a motion to reopen and has been adjudicated in accordance with the regulations governing such motions. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); see also Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991).

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julia C. Chimarusti
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening and reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This matter was last before us on June 30, 1999, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from a decision of an Immigration Judge dated October 10, 1997, denying his motion to reopen deportation proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of deportation entered in his case on October 1, 1996. The respondent has submitted what is styled as a motion to reconsider and reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
Initially, if treated as a motion to reconsider, the respondent’s motion is untimely filed. The regulations provide that a motion to reconsider in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 30 days after the date of that decision, or on or before July 31, 1996, whichever is later. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The Board denied the respondent’s appeal on June 30, 1999. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the respondent’s motion until December 28, 2004. If treated as a motion to reconsider, the motion is not properly before us for adjudication, as it was untimely filed.
 
Moreover, even if it had been timely submitted, the motion would have been denied. When deciding a motion to reconsider, the Board considers the case as though the decision in the case on the record before us had never been entered. If the respondent was eligible for relief at the time of the original decision, then in reconsidering the decision, we treat his status as that which it had been at the time of the initial decision. “The very nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard.” Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991). The respondent’s motion alleges error in the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent had the opportunity on appeal to raise all alleged errors in the Immigration Judge’s decision. However, the respondent raised no arguments on appeal which were not addressed by the Immigration Judge or which would have caused us to reverse the Immigration Judge’s decision. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995), (proper service of notice of service or receipt of the notice by the respondent is not required to effect service). Because the respondent has not shown that our previous decision was defective in any way, the motion for reconsideration is denied.
 
Furthermore, if the respondent’s motion were treated as one to reopen, denial would still be appropriate. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on February 8, 2001. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before September 30, 1999. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the respondent’s motion until December 28, 2004. Therefore, the motion to reopen was filed out of time.
 
*2 Notwithstanding, even assuming arguendo the respondent’s motion had been timely filed, denial would still be appropriate. A “motion to reopen proceedings seeks to reopen proceedings so that new evidence can be presented and so that a new decision can be entered, normally after a further evidentiary hearing.” Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 403 (BIA 1991). Such a motion may not be granted unless the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Finally, an alien must establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought before a motion to reopen will be granted. Matter of Gutierrez, 21 I&N Dec. 479, 482 (BIA 1996). Here, the respondent reiterates arguments that were made, and considered, below.
 
Furthermore, to the extent the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has failed to meet the threshold requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as articulated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637(BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997). We recognize that the present case arises within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which has held that the procedural requirements established in Lozada are not sacrosanct. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F. 3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). However, aside from the respondent’s declaration that is appended to his motion and his contention that he has communicated with said former attorney and the Bar disciplinary authorities in Illinois concerning his former attorney’s actions, the respondent has not presented any evidence to corroborate these claims.
 
Moreover, the respondent waited more than five years to file this motion and does not allege any fraud or deception on the part of his former attorney that could possibly invoke consideration of “equitable tolling” of the statute. See Ituribarria v. INS, 321 F. 3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (in order for equitable tolling to apply, the invoking party must show that he was prevented from properly filing a motion to reopen because of fraud, deception, or error); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F. 3d 1176, 1193 (9th Cir. 2001) (in order for equitable tolling to apply, respondent needs to show that his ignorance was caused by circumstances beyond his control, and which go beyond a claim of excusable neglect.). The arguments contained in the respondent’s motion were previously considered, and rejected. Consequently, where the respondent has failed to comply with any of the Lozada requirements and where the respondent has also failed to show any prejudice, we are respondent has failed to comply with any of the Lozada requirements and where the respondent has also failed to show any prejudice, we are compelled to deny the motion to reopen on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*3 Therefore, as the respondent offers no new or previously unavailable evidence, we find reopening is not warranted. Accordingly, the respondent’s motions are denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Phuong D. Mai, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Debra H. Workeneh
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before us on September 3, 2004, when we dismissed the respondent’s motion to reopen our decision of June 1, 2004, in which we affirmed without opinion an Immigration Judge’s March 18, 2003, decision to deny the respondent’s cancellation of removal application. The respondent was granted the privilege of voluntary departure. The respondent now has filed a motion to reconsider. The DHS has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
A party seeking reconsideration requests that the original decision be reexamined in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that was overlooked. See Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). A motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and be supported by any pertinent precedent decisions. 8 C.F.R § 1003.2(b)(1) (2004). A motion to reconsider based upon a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied. See Matter of Tiwari, 20 I&N Dec. 254 (BIA 1991), citing Matter of Medrano, 20 I&N Dec. 216 (BIA 1990, 1991).
 
By way of background, an Immigration Judge had determined that the respondent had failed to establish exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his United States citizen children, and he therefore denied the cancellation application. In the respondent’s previous motion, which we denied on September 3, 2004, he had requested reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel, and he also requested additional time to present supplemental evidence bearing on the issue of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his children. In our decision denying the motion to reopen, we noted that the respondent had failed to comply with the requirements to prevail under an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, nor had he demonstrated that his prior counsel’s actions had prejudiced his cancellation application. In addition, we found that the respondent had not established that the additional evidence he sought to present in support of his cancellation application was previously unavailable.
 
In the instant motion, the respondent, through counsel, requests that the Board reconsider its previous decision. Counsel essentially alleges that it was error not to grant the respondent additional time to submit a “brief” after he filed his motion to reopen, and that we erroneously found that the respondent had not filed his motion to reopen within 90 days.1
 
*2 We decline to reconsider the respondent’s case. Upon review, we find that the respondent has not alleged the existence of any errors of law or fact in our prior decision to warrant reconsideration. In this connection, we point out that all relevant information should have been contained in the motion to reopen, and that the Board’s motions procedure does not allow additional time for the filing of a “brief” after the motion has been filed. Furthermore, counsel has incorrectly alleged that we denied the motion to reopen as untimely. Rather, in our decision of September 3, 2004, we found that 90 days already had elapsed since the entry of our decision on June 1, 2004, and that the respondent was therefore precluded from submitting additional evidence because the time period for filing the motion to reopen had expired. In any event, the respondent has failed to establish that his prior counsel’s actions adversely affected his cancellation application, or that the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny his cancellation application because of the absence of any exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his United States citizen children was in error.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

To the extent that counsel’s instant motion could be construed as a motion to reopen, for purposes of completeness, we note that the instant motion represents an improper second motion to reopen that does not fall within any of the narrow exceptions to the regulation permitting only one motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frank P. Sprouls, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lucia A. Fiorentino,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen and remand proceedings based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.1 New counsel for the respondent claims that prior counsel failed to advise him that he was eligible for “re-papering,” an administrative device permitting certain aliens to be placed in removal proceedings so that they could pursue applications for cancellation of removal. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion.
 
We have held that to satisfy a claim based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must support his claim by a detailed affidavit, inform his previous attorney of the allegations of misconduct and provide former counsel with an opportunity to respond, and state whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to the attorney’s alleged violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also, Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (Courts have held in similar situations that an alien was not required to fulfill procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, inasmuch as the record indicated a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance). Here, the respondent has failed to offer any evidence in support of his claim therefore the respondent has failed to satisfy any of the elements required to demonstrate that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The respondent has submitted a photocopy of a letter filed with the State Bar of California, but the letter fails to provide the nature of the alleged ineffective assistance. Resp’s Motion, Exh. H. The respondent has not submitted any evidence that former counsel was contacted or that he was provided an opportunity to respond. We find that the respondent has failed to satisfy a showing of ineffective assistance. Moreover, the respondent has demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance. Matter of Aassad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent indicated that he became prima facie eligible for cancellation of removal due to the birth of his United States citizen child, but he has not presented any argument that his removal would cause his child the requisite hardship. See section 240A of the Immigration and Nationality Act.. Based upon our finding that the respondent was not provided ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent’s motion is denied as untimely filed.

Although the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely filed, the time limitation period at section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act may be equitably tolled under the case law of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. See Fajardo v. INS, 300 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2002) (the limitation period on motions to reopen based on exceptional circumstances must be tolled until petitioner was aware of the harm resulting from attorney’s misconduct). According to the respondent’s affidavit submitted in support of his claim of ineffective assistance of former counsel, the respondent became aware of his former attorney’s initial ineffective assistance only after the respondent consulted new counsel in December 2004.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Arthur Avazian, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julia C. Chimarusti,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 20, 2004, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States, following the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing on February 9, 2004. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
On appeal and in his motion to reopen, the respondent contends that he demonstrated exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear, based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the respondent contends that an employee of his former attorney, Gerald Cobb, Esquire, told him that his next hearing was scheduled for February 19, 2004, rather than the correct date of February 9, 2004. Based on this representation, the respondent did not appear for his hearing on February 9, 2004. With his motion to reopen, the respondent submitted numerous documents, including his declaration, his wife’s declaration, and the declaration of Mr. Cobb, his former attorney. In his declaration, the respondent indicates that he has been in removal proceedings since April 2000, and he has had many court appearances since then. He also states that he does not blame Mr. Cobb himself, and since he has admitted that there was an error in his office regarding the date, he does not intend to file a complaint with the State Bar against Mr. Cobb. In Mr. Cobb’s declaration, he states that his former receptionist erroneously informed the respondent that the date of his next hearing was February 19, 2004. Mr. Cobb also notes that he has very limited experience practicing immigration law and was unaware of what procedure to follow to preserve respondent’s rights and protect his position.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996).
 
Precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this case arises, provides that while the requirements of Lozada are generally reasonable, they need not be rigidly enforced where their purpose is fully served by other means. Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237, 1240 n.6 (9th Cir. 2000). The Ninth Circuit determined that “Lozada is intended to ensure both that an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra. Furthermore, where the face of the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel, there has been substantial compliance with the rule. Id. Finally, the Ninth Circuit has determined that under certain circumstances, the failure to file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities does not defeat an alien’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934 (9th Cir. 2003) (Court noted that aliens had appeared at all previously scheduled removal hearings; alien had filed an extensive application that presented substantial evidence of eligibility for discretionary relief from removal; and neither he nor his wife had any reason to miss their hearing and subject themselves to an in absentia order).
 
*2 The record in the instant case supports the conclusion that based on the totality of circumstances, the respondent has established exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. It appears that due to the actions of a former employee of Mr. Cobb, the respondent was informed of an incorrect date for his next scheduled appearance before the Immigration Court. The respondent submitted his own affidavit and Mr. Cobb’s affidavit. The respondent also explained why he did not file a State Bar complaint against Mr. Cobb. Furthermore, the record of proceedings reflects that the respondent had appeared for hearings in the Los Angeles Immigration Court numerous times between April 2000 and June 2003. Consequently, it would be inconsistent for the respondent to fail to appear for a hearing. The record also reflects the respondent was awaiting the approval of a visa petition filed on his behalf, which apparently has now been approved. We find that the respondent has presented a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We note that the requirement that a bar complaint be filed is to ensure that collusion does not occur, and that the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a valid one. See Matter of Lozada, supra. Therefore, as we find that counsel did afford the respondent ineffective assistance and in light of the lack of any bar complaint, we shall forward this matter to the Executive Office for Immigration Review Bar counsel for review and the institution of any disciplinary measures deemed appropriate. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Jonathan D. Montag, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathan Grant
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The Board on December 21, 2004, denied a motion to reopen filed by the respondent. The respondent on January 4, 2005, filed a motion seeking to have the Board reconsider this order. The motion, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service), will be granted.
 
On April 22, 2002, the Board affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision which found the respondent subject to removal under section 237(a)(2)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), for having been convicted on March 25, 1999, of a crime of domestic violence. More than 2 years later, on July 23, 2004, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen.
 
The respondent claimed in his motion to reopen that the motions deadline should be tolled because he received ineffective assistance of counsel from his former attorney, who represented him until 2004 before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Immigration Judge on June 5, 2000, determined that the respondent was ineligible for cancellation of removal, for permanent residents, under section 240A(a) of the Act, because he had not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence for 5 years, having been adjusted to that status on June 18, 1996. See section 240A(a)(1) of the Act. The respondent argued in the motion to reopen that former counsel failed to file a motion to remand on or after June 18, 2001, when his eligibility for relief “ripened”, Mot. to Reopen, at 3. In our December 21, 2004, decision, we determined that the respondent was nonetheless ineligible for cancellation of removal, because his continuous residence ended on January 14, 1999, the day that he committed a crime involving moral turpitude, and prior counsel committed no error by not pursuing relief for the respondent. Upon the respondent’s pending motion, we have reconsidered this decision. At the time the respondent committed his crime, he had already accrued the 7 years of continuous residence that is required under section 240A(a)(2) of the Act, as he presents evidence that he was admitted to the United States in 1989 as a nonimmigrant, and the DHS does not dispute this.
 
The respondent has complied with Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Former counsel admits he erred by not filing a timely motion to reopen seeking cancellation of removal.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Our order of December 21, 2004, is rescinded.
 
*2 FURTHER ORDER: The case is remanded to the immigration court to provide the respondent the opportunity to apply for cancellation of removal.

APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
  
ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent’s appeal is dismissed. We concur with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent has failed to demonstrate plausible grounds for relief. Specifically, the primary relief the respondent seeks is reopening of his proceedings after an in absentia order of removal was entered. The request for reopening is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (both with respect to the reason for the respondent’s failure to appear and with respect to a failure to perfect an earlier appeal with this Board). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The ultimate relief sought is a waiver under section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c).
 
The record reflects that on June 15, 1999, the respondent was served with Notice to Appear alleging that he was removable from the United States pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A). On November 3, 1999, the respondent was ordered removed in absentia when he failed to appear at his scheduled removal hearing. The record reflects that the respondent was provided proper notice of the hearing and that he had been personally informed of the date of the hearing and of the consequences of not appearing on that date.
 
Neither the respondent, who is now pro se, or any of his former attorneys, has ever presented a persuasive factual or legal argument that proceedings should be reopened. Assuming arguendo that the respondent established that his attorney actually miscalendared the date of the November, 1999 hearing, as claimed, the respondent still has not established that the attorney’s conduct prejudiced the respondent to a sufficient degree to justify reopening of proceedings. See Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105 (BIA 1984). The respondent, not his attorney, was primarily responsible for attending his removal hearing. The respondent had been personally notified of the date of the hearing and the consequences of failing to appear. The alleged mistake on the part of the respondent’s attorney did not prevent the respondent from complying with the minimal responsibility of attending his removal hearing. Consequently, the respondent has not demonstrated a plausible basis for relief. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003) (detailing the necessary steps for making a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and discussing the basis for a finding that a respondent was prejudiced by ineffective assistance).
 
*2 We note that recent regulatory changes affecting the eligibility for section 212(c) relief for certain aliens, on which the respondent partially relies in his assertion that proceedings in this case should be reopened, do not contain any relevant change in the requirements for obtaining reopening of proceedings after the entry of an in absentia order of removal. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3 (2004).
 
In sum, there is no basis on which to sustain the respondent’s appeal. In light of the foregoing, we need not reach the other issues raised on appeal by the respondent and the DHS.
 
The respondent was correctly found removable from the United States and he has demonstrated no basis on which his request to reopen proceedings should be granted. Consequently, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Neil A. Weinrib, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on February 14, 2002, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen to rescind the in absentia removal order entered on April 12, 2001. We found that the respondent had not shown the exceptional circumstances required for reopening his case. The matter is now before us pursuant to the October 31, 2003, decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The court remanded the case for the Board to consider the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
In light of the court’s decision, and upon further review of the record, the removal proceedings will be reopened. The respondent has substantially complied with the requirements of Lozada. See generally Dakane v. U.S. Attorney General, 371 F.3d 771 (11th Cir. 2004). Further, it appears that the respondent did not appear for his hearing because he was “blatantly misled” by his counsel that he did not need to appear. See Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472, 474 (BIA 1996). The respondent also appears to be eligible to apply to adjust his status, so he has every reason to appear for his removal hearing.
 
Accordingly, the decision of the Board dated February 14, 2002, is vacated, the removal proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. The respondent’s unopposed motion to change the venue of his case from Orlando, Florida, to New York, New York, is hereby granted.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Paul M. Kaplan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondents in this case are husband and wife, both natives and citizens of Mexico. Their case was previously before the Board on April 24, 2002, when we summarily affirmed, without opinion, the results of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying their applications for cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge found that the respondents had not shown that they satisfied the 10 years continuous physical presence requirement for nonimmigrant cancellation of removal, and had not shown that their citizen children, or the male respondent’s lawful permanent resident father, would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if the respondents were removed to Mexico. On January 9, 2003, the Board denied the respondents’ motion to reopen based on their claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The matter is now before us pursuant to the August 19, 2004, decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The court found that the Board did not adequately or properly consider the respondents’ claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. It remanded the case for the Board to further consider whether adequate counsel would have acted differently in this case, and, if so, whether the respondents were prejudiced by counsel’s inadequate performance.
 
In light of the court’s decision, and upon further review of the record, we will grant the respondents’ motion to reopen and will remand the case to the Immigration Judge. A review of the transcript supports the respondents’ claim that their prior counsel did not adequately prepare them to fully present their cancellation applications, on either the issue of physical presence, or hardship. Further, the brief filed by former counsel on appeal is cursory, at best, and incorrectly includes boilerplate language regarding the hardship standard for suspension of deportation, not cancellation of removal. In addition, as noted by the respondents, prior counsel never brought to the Board’s attention the fact that the male respondent’s mother became a lawful permanent resident during the pendency of the appeal.
 
We have also noted the Immigration Judge’s complaints at the hearing regarding counsel’s performance in this and other cases, as well as the fact that former counsel has now been disbarred. Given all these considerations, we find that the respondents’ former counsel provided inadequate representation at their hearing, and in representing them in their appeal to this Board. We further find that counsel’s inadequate performance “may have affected the outcome of the proceedings.” See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 900 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
*2 Finally, we note that the last hearing in this case was held nearly 6 years ago. The respondents’ citizen children are now 10 and 9 years old. The male respondent’s parents are apparently partly dependent upon the respondents for their support. Under all these circumstances, we find that the respondents should be provided a further opportunity to establish that they are eligible for and deserving of cancellation of removal. See generally Matter of Recinas, 23 I&N Dec. 467 (BIA 2002).
 
Accordingly, the decisions of the Board in this case dated April 24, 2002, and January 9, 2003, are vacated, the removal proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for a further hearing.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joseph C. Barrera, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
J. Grant
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Termination; remand
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the decision of the Immigration Judge dated September 9, 2003, in which the Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal and denied his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The respondent has moved for a remand to the Immigration Judge for a new hearing. The appeal will be dismissed and the motion will be denied.
 
The issue on appeal involves whether the respondent, who is a lawful permanent resident, was properly found subject to removal. The respondent’s appeal raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The record establishes that on May 1, 2001, the first Immigration Judge to whom this case was assigned ordered the respondent’s former counsel, Attorney McCandless, to submit a pre-hearing statement setting out any objections to the admission of the Form I-213, Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien, pertaining to the respondent, which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) sought to submit into evidence (Exhs. 2, 6). That attorney failed to file any such statement during the time permitted. Three months after the deadline for the statement, the Immigration Judge issued an order finding that any objections to the admission of the Form I-213 were waived (Exh. 6). The Immigration Judge further found that the Form I-213 contained a sufficient factual basis to establish allegations regarding alienage and was clear, cogent, and convincing evidence of the alien-smuggling charge in the respondent’s Notice to Appear (Exhs. 1, 6). The Immigration Judge found the respondent subject to removal as charged and set a hearing date for the respondent to apply for relief from removal (Exh. 6).
 
The respondent’s former counsel failed to appear for the hearing. The respondent arrived in the courtroom after the Immigration Judge had issued an order of removal in absentia. Thereafter proceedings were reopened pursuant to a motion to reopen, which was filed by respondent’s former counsel.
 
After proceedings were reopened, the case was assigned to a new Immigration Judge. At the February 25, 2003, hearing, the respondent’s former counsel did not appear but instead sent substitute counsel, Attorney Miller. The respondent agreed to be represented by Attorney Miller as well as by Attorney McCandless (Tr. at 13). During the continued hearing, the Immigration Judge first stated that the Form I-213 was unclear about whether the respondent admitted knowing the passenger he carried in his car was illegal before the car was stopped at the Mexican border and that this should be considered by the respondent when deciding whether to concede the charge of removability, which was for alien smuggling (Tr. at 21-22, 25). At the next hearing date, the Immigration Judge berated Attorney Miller for suggesting that the charge of removability would be contested (Tr. at 28-29). The Immigration Judge stated that removability had been established by the prior Immigration Judge and indicated that Attorney Miller was wasting the court’s time (Tr. at 29-31). The Immigration Judge appeared to have no recollection whatsoever of his prior instruction concerning this matter. Attorney Miller telephoned the office of Attorney McCandless and then advised the Immigration Judge that the charge of removability would not be challenged (Tr. at 31-35). A hearing was set to consider the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act. Neither Attorney McCandless nor Attorney Miller appeared at that hearing, and the Immigration Judge proceeded without them (Tr. at 44-47). After a hearing on the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal, the application was denied.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent is represented by new counsel. The respondent makes no specific challenges to the Immigration Judge’s denial of cancellation of removal. He states only that he was prevented from presenting his case when neither of his attorneys appeared for his hearing. The respondent indicates that after his attorneys did not appear, he requested the Immigration Judge to grant a continuance. However, no such request is reflected by the record. On appeal, the respondent seeks a remand to allow him to present his case. With respect to the issue of removability, the respondent states that his former counsel erred in conceding removability and in failing to inform the Immigration Judge of a witness who was willing to testify that the respondent did not know the person he was driving across the Mexican border was an illegal alien.
 
We find that the respondent has not established his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Although we do not discount the seriousness of the respondent’s attorneys’ failure to appear at the hearing, we nevertheless do not find that the respondent has established he was ultimately prejudiced by his attorneys’ actions or inactions. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640.1
 
The Form I-213 in the record states that the respondent advised officials he knew the person he was transporting did not present valid documents at the border (Exh. 2). Furthermore, the alien-smuggling incident at issue occurred after the respondent had twice before been apprehended while transporting aliens, who lacked valid documents, across the Mexican border (Tr. at 75-77). The respondent admitted at his hearing that he knew one of these aliens was attempting to enter the United States illegally (Tr. at 77). On appeal, the respondent does not address Attorney McCandless’s failure to file a challenge to the admission of the Form I-213. Moreover, the respondent does not indicate what such a challenge would allege. The respondent’s appeal brief states that the respondent’s attorneys failed to advise the Immigration Judge of a witness who could testify the respondent did not know the alien he was transporting lacked valid entry documents. However, the respondent did not submit an affidavit stating that he advised his attorneys about this potential witness. The respondent has not submitted any other evidence with respect to his challenge to the finding of removability. We find no error in the conclusion that the respondent is subject to removal as charged. Therefore, we do not find the outcome of the respondent’s case would have been different but for his attorneys’ failure to provide appropriate legal services. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 527 n.12 (9th Cir. 2000) (noting that due process challenges to deportation proceedings require a showing of prejudice). Finally, as previously noted, the respondent does not specifically allege any error in the denial of cancellation of removal.
 
*3 For these reasons, the respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and his motion to remand will be denied.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

In reaching our decision, we have considered that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that an alien need not fulfill all the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel when the record reflects a clear and obvious case of such. See Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frank P. Sprouls, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Grace H. Cheung,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 In an order entered on July 30, 2004, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen, which is opposed by the Department of Homeland Security. The motion will be denied.
 
The basis for the motion, in its essence, is that counsel himself “failed utterly” in filing a petition for review of our order, and that the case should be reopened to reissue our order with a new date, to permit its review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
 
In the first instance, the motion is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). In the second, the respondent has not shown sufficient compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Azanor v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2004). While the motion is associated with a photocopy of Mr. Sprouls’ alleged letter to his state bar, admitting “ineffective assistance of counsel,” there is no evidence that the letter was actually filed or that the respondent actually submitted a formal complaint against him. Although there is a photocopy of an attorney-client contract, dated August 23, 2004, with the motion, it is unclear when the respondent actually contacted Mr. Sprouls regarding representation. If the respondent had waited until after the expiration of the voluntary departure period, he would be ineligible for cancellation in any event.
 
Additionally, the respondent is utterly silent on this matter. The respondent has not explained when he contacted Mr. Sprouls; what his understanding was of the actions Mr. Sprouls was to take on his behalf; what efforts he himself made in the preparation of his petition, if any; what the level and frequency of communication was between Mr. Sprouls and him regarding any legal representation; and what actions he took in regard to filing a complaint with Mr. Sprouls’ state bar. At a minimum, we would expect an affidavit from the respondent supporting the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Given the dearth of facts in, and associated with, the motion, we do not think it a rigid application of our holding in Matter of Lozada, supra, to deny this motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul S. Zoltan, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)º - Remained longer than permitted
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b) to reconsider our decision dated November 18, 2004. We will deny the motion.
 
On October 30, 1990, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent deported when he failed to appear at a scheduled deportation hearing. See former section 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b). On December 17, 1999, the Immigration Judge denied a motion wherein the respondent requested reopening to enable him to apply for benefits under the NACARA. On February 5, 2004, the respondent filed a motion wherein he requested reopening and reconsideration of the December 17, 1999, decision. In that motion, the respondent argued that he had been the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. On February 23, 2004, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen and reconsider based on his finding that motion was filed in an untimely manner. The respondent filed a timely appeal from the February 23, 2004, decision, and we dismissed the appeal on November 18, 2004. This timely motion to reconsider followed. The respondent now argues that we erred as a matter of law in dismissing the appeal. For the following reasons, we disagree.
 
In the instant motion, the respondent asserts that we improperly declined to consider the issue of whether the respondent received adequate notice of the October 30, 1990, hearing which was conducted in his absence. The record reflects, however, that this issue was not considered or ruled upon by the Immigration Judge. Indeed, it is undisputed that the respondent had not raised the issue at any time before the Immigration Judge. We stress that it is the function of this Board, as an appellate body, to review a record as it existed before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 1984). The issue of the adequacy of notice was not, therefore, properly before the Board on appeal. See Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191, 196 n.4 (BIA 1980). We thus find no error in our decision declining to consider the “notice” issue in our decision dismissing the appeal.
 
The respondent further asserts that we erred in concluding that he was not entitled to toll the deadline for the motion to reopen and reconsider to accommodate his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See generally Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir. 2004); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001). Specifically, he asserts that we engaged in “impermissible factfinding” when we determined that the respondent failed to establish that he merits equitable tolling because he failed to act with due diligence in exercising his rights. In response to the respondent’s assertion, we emphasize that our decision with regard to equitable tolling was based on our analysis of the facts which were before the Immigration Judge at the time of the February 23, 2004, decision. In light of those facts, we disagree with the assertion, which the respondent has put forth in the instant motion, that a “factfinder might well find that a ‘reasonable person’ in the Respondent’s situation … would not have heard alarm bells when he received no immediate word on his NACARA motion to reopen.” We stress that a period of more than 4 years had passed between the Immigration Judge’s December 17, 1999, decision and the respondent’s February 5, 2004, motion to reopen and reconsider. We note that in the “bar complaint,” which the respondent submitted to the Immigration Judge in support of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the respondent stated that “it seemed odd” that he had not received any correspondence from his attorney after he contacted the attorney’s office on or about September 11, 1998. He also stated in the complaint, however, that he “decided not to contact (his former attorney) for various reasons, primarily because of the unprofessional and disrespectful manner in which she made (him) feel.” The fact that the respondent chose to eschew communication with his attorney, even though he felt that “it seemed odd” that the attorney had not communicated with him since 1998, leads us to stand by our conclusion that he failed to act with due diligence in this case.
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, we will not alter our November 18, 2004, decision. Accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN RE: GUSTAVO ZAMORA MARTINEZ
File: AXX XX1 470 - Los Angeles
February 10, 2005
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Elsa Martinez, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated February 9, 2004. The respondent contends that his former representative afforded him ineffective assistance of counsel as he failed to file an appeal brief.
 
The respondent reported in his motion that he did not learn of his former attorney’s failure to file a brief on appeal until he consulted with his current attorney. The record contains an August 2004 letter from the respondent’s new representative seeking review of the record of proceedings, and his motion was filed within two months of that date. In light of this evidence, we find that the respondent exercised diligence in submitting the pending motion, and the deadline for such motions should be tolled. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
The respondent has submitted evidence suggesting that he complied with the requirements for a motion contending ineffective assistance of counsel by detailing the agreement he had with his former counsel, notifying him of the allegations against him, and filing a complaint with the appropriate bar authority. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). We agree that the respondent received ineffective assistance from his former counsel. However, the respondent must also demonstrate that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that alien is prejudiced if attorney’s conduct may have affected the outcome of the proceeding); Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855 (9th Cir. 2004); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
However, the respondent has not provided any evidence with the motion which indicates that the outcome of his appeal might have been different had a brief been filed. The Board did not summarily dismiss his appeal for failure to file a brief, but summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s adverse findings. The respondent, other than generally asserting that he meets the requisite criteria for a grant of cancellation of removal, has not addressed these negative findings with any specificity. Based upon this lack of proof, we are unable to find that the respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements for proving that he was prejudiced by his former attorney in these proceedings, and reopening is not warranted.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied.

The respondent also requests that the removal proceedings be reopened and that the case be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings. We will deny the motion to reopen and dismiss the appeal.
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision finding that the respondent is ineligible for a section 212(c) waiver because he is no longer a lawful permanent resident after self-deporting himself from the United States in 1997 following an Immigration Judge’s November 18, 1991, decision ordering him deported to Greece (Tr. at 31). See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (the Board may adopt or affirm an Immigration Judge’s decision, in whole or in part); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1.1(p), 241.7, 1003.4, 1003.39; Matter of Lok, 18 I&N Dec. 101, 105 (BIA 1981) (the lawful permanent resident status of an alien ends with the entry of a final administrative order of deportation); see also 69 Fed. Reg. 57826, 57834 (September 28, 2004) (to be codified at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(k)) (aliens issued a final order of deportation, who then illegally return to the United States, are not eligible to file a special motion to seek section 212(c) relief).
 
*2 We reject the respondent’s contention that his due process rights were violated because he was not notified of the consequences of departing the United States. The regulations provided sufficient notice to his counsel and to him of the consequences of his leaving the United States during the pendency of his appeal with the Board. The case that he cites in his brief, Matter of Brown, 18 I&N Dec. 324 (BIA 1982), is inapposite to this case because it concerned the departure of the alien during deportation proceedings. The respondent is also ineligible for cancellation of removal because he is not a lawful permanent resident, and because he has been convicted of a drug offense. See sections 240A(a), 240A(b)(1)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(a), 1229b(b)(1)(C).
 
We deny the motion to reopen and remand the case based upon ineffective assistance of counsel because it is clearly untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (a motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of the final administrative order). Furthermore, assuming, without deciding, that the respondent complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozado, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), he has not demonstrated that he exercised due diligence to justify the equitably tolling of the motions deadlines because there is no evidence that he maintained contact with the attorney that filed the appeal with the Board (Tr. at 30-31). See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 135 (2nd Cir. 2000) (the alien must demonstrate that he has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period he seeks to toll). Accordingly, we enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied and the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Fernandez, Regis, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated March 31, 2003. The respondent’s untimely motion to reopen is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Although the respondent has substantially complied with the procedural steps set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), he has failed to prove any prejudice resulting from his former counsel’s performance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The motion is denied. The respondent’s documentation establishes that his former attorney, J.D. Larosiliere, absconded from New Jersey and abandoned his clients in February 2002. See Motion to Reopen, Attachment B at 12. At the time, the respondent’s appeal was pending before this Board. The record reveals that Mr. Montilus, an associate of Mr. Larosiliere, represented the respondent before the Immigration Judge. On June 19, 2001, Mr. Larosiliere filed an appeal brief on behalf of the respondent. On March 31, 2003, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent claims that he first discovered that his appeal was dismissed in April 2004, when he was arrested. Even if we accept the respondent’s claim that he first learned of our order a year after it was issued, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by Mr. Larosiliere’s misconduct during the course of these deportation proceedings. The respondent cites no misconduct that occurred before the Immigration Judge. Nor does he cite any error in the appeal brief that was filed with this Board. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ta-Yu Yang, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Debra H. Workeneh
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia for his failure to appear at the hearing on March 29, 2004. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal and in his motion to reopen, the respondent asserts that he never received the notice of hearing from the Immigration Court or his attorney. He contends that he was working in Iowa at the time of his hearing, and that he has the right to work outside of the immigration district in which his case was pending.
 
We find that proper notice was provided to the respondent. The record reflects that the Notice to Appear was served personally on the respondent on May 7, 1998. The hearing notice was mailed to the respondent’s attorney of record on July 10, 2003, with a hearing scheduled for March 29, 2004. As the respondent’s attorney received notice of the hearing, proper notice was provided to the respondent. See Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). Furthermore, it appears that the respondent failed to stay in contact with his attorney to ascertain his hearing date, or to provide new contact information for himself while he was working in Iowa. The respondent also did not submit an affidavit in support of his motion to reopen. The respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. We find that based upon the evidence of record, the respondent received notice of the hearing in accordance with the Act, and he has not met the burden of demonstrating lack of notice under the statute. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Pro se1
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Paula V. Davis
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 16, 2004, in which she denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on January 20, 2004. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that he did not receive notice from anyone that his case was scheduled for a hearing on January 20, 2004, and that he only received notice from the court and his attorney that the hearing was scheduled for February 3, 2004. The respondent also asserts that the Immigration Judge incorrectly held that if the motion to reopen was based on exceptional circumstances, his motion would be time barred because it was filed more than 90 days after entry of the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
Initially, we agree with the Immigration Judge that proper notice was provided to the respondent. The record reflects that on September 8, 2003, a new notice of hearing was sent to the respondent’s attorney of record, indicating that the respondent’s hearing had been rescheduled to January 20, 2004. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 10013.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 292.5(a). The Immigration Judge noted that the new notice of hearing was never returned as undeliverable and it was mailed over four months before the new hearing date. See I.J. Dec. at 2. Furthermore, the respondent’s former attorney of record did not submit an affidavit with the motion to reopen attesting to his failure to receive the new notice of hearing. The motion to reopen contains a purported declaration of the respondent, but it is signed by the respondent’s former attorney of record.
 
We agree with the respondent that the Immigration Judge incorrectly determined that if the respondent’s motion to reopen was based on exceptional circumstances, his motion was time barred as it was filed more than 90 days after the in absentia order of removal. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(h)(4)(ii), an order of removal entered in absentia pursuant to section 240(h)(5) of the Act may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal, if based on exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act. A review of the record reflects that the Immigration Judge’s order of removal was entered in absentia on January 20, 2004. The respondent filed his motion to reopen on May 24, 2004. Therefore the respondent filed his motion to reopen within 180 days after issuance of the order of removal, as required under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. The respondent claims that he has established an exceptional circumstance based on his failure to receive notice of the rescheduled hearing. However, as discussed above, notice of the new hearing was sent to the respondent’s former attorney of record. See Matter of Barocio, supra. The respondent has not alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, nor has he attempted to comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: JOSE AGUILAR-LOPEZ
File: AXX XX1 777 - San Francisco
February 8, 2005
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Robert Kahn, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Margaret Curry
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on March 19, 1991, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s denial of his application for suspension of deportation and denial of a request for a continuance. On November 29, 2004, the respondent submitted a motion to reconsider and reopen proceedings, asserting that the Immigration Judge and this Board erred in our prior decisions, his former counsel afforded him ineffective assistance of counsel, and contending that he is now eligible for adjustment of status. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the respondent’s motion. The respondent’s motion is untimely, and is denied.
 
We do not find that the respondent’s situation falls within the Ninth Circuit’s equitable tolling policy for aliens who have filed with the Board otherwise untimely motions in which they raise allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001). The Ninth Circuit has stated that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d at 897.
 
In the present case, the respondent admits in his declaration that he was aware that an appeal had been filed on his behalf, stating that he was in contact with his former representative a year after the appeal was filed, which would have been in 1987. The respondent alleges that he was provided with ineffective assistance because his former counsel failed to inform him of our March 1991, decision. However, the respondent has not specified what efforts he made to remain in contact with his counsel during the more than 4-year period his case was on appeal, and the more than thirteen years since the Board issued its adverse decision. The respondent admittedly spoke with another attorney in, apparently, 1989, and learned that his former counsel had closed her office. Yet he apparently took no further action to either contact his former representative, or otherwise ascertain the status of his appeal. Consequently, we find that the respondent has failed to establish that he acted diligently in this case.
 
We also find that the respondent has not demonstrated either that his attorney did, in fact, afford him ineffective assistance, or that he suffered any prejudice arising from former counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness. The respondent’s disagreement with his former counsel’s tactical decisions regarding admitting the factual allegations and conceding removability do not, without more, support a finding of ineffective assistance. Moreover, the record supports these actions, which includes a record of deportable alien and a record of conviction which indicate that the respondent entered the United States in December 1979, and that they terminated his probation in March 1986 with a 180-day sentence imposed to be served consecutively with another sentence, with evidence that he was released in November 1986 (Exhs. 2, 3). Thus evidence then of record supported the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent entered the United States in December 1979, which contradicts the respondent’s uncorroborated assertion that he entered prior to that time. Moreover, while the respondent contests the Immigration Judge’s, and this Board’s, finding that he was incarcerated more than 180 days he has not reported what term he in fact served, and, as noted, the record supports the factual findings in this regard. Consequently, the respondent has failed to establish prejudice as a result of his former counsel’s assistance, or that the same was ineffective. Iturribarria, 321 F.3d at 899-900 (in order to show prejudice, a petitioner must establish his counsel’s performance “was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings”).
 
*2 Finally, even if the respondent’s motion were not otherwise barred, we note that a motion to reopen for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all the supporting documentation. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). In the present case, the respondent has not submitted proof of an approved visa petition. In fact, the respondent has not provided evidence that the immigrant petition has been filed on his behalf. Nor has he provided evidence that he is married or that his wife is a United States citizen. In addition, he has not supported the motion with an application to adjust his status. A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the respondent establishes a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Here we find that the respondent has failed to establish his eligibility to adjust his status.
 
Therefore, for all of the above reasons, the respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Moreno, Leticia T.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 07, 2003. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to establish eligibility for cancellation of removal for not showing the requisite degree of hardship to the respondent’s qualifying relatives. The decision of the Immigration Judge is affirmed for the reasons provided therein. On appeal, the respondent argued that the respondent was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and did not receive a fair hearing. According to the respondent, the respondent’s former attorney did not adequately prepare for the hearing, and improperly withdrew as counsel prior thereto. Notwithstanding, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Namely, there is no indication that a complaint was filed against former counsel, and whether he was given an opportunity to reply to the allegations. In addition, the respondent has not provided any evidence of hardship that was not presented or considered by the Immigration Judge. In the absence thereof, we see no reason to remand the record for a new hearing. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the alien is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the alien fails to so depart, the alien shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the alien fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the alien shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before the Board on July 19, 2004, when we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The respondent has filed a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion will be granted, and proceedings will be reopened.
 
In his motion, the respondent argues that former counsel failed to adequately prepare him for trial, failed to file an appeal brief which resulted in the summary dismissal of his appeal, and failed to timely notify him of the Board’s decision, which caused him to unwittingly overstay the period of voluntary departure. As an initial matter, we note that the respondent has complied with the evidentiary requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, by submitting an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts, evidence that a grievance has been filed, and proof that prior counsel has been notified of the allegations. However, he has not shown that he was prejudiced by his counsel’s performance at the hearing or by the failure to file an appeal brief. See id., at 638 (holding that an alien alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must show that he was prejudiced by counsel’s performance). Although he claims that his former attorney only met with him once before the hearing, he has not specified what evidence or testimony his attorney failed to elicit or adduce. Current counsel even concedes that she “is not in a position to allege prejudice as to the substance of the merits hearing” (Motion, at 6). Likewise, the respondent’s bare assertion that he was prejudiced by the failure to file an appeal brief is insufficient to demonstrate the requisite prejudice. The fact that prior counsel did not submit a brief does not, in itself, amount to a deprivation of due process. Id.; see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (finding that the attorney’s failure to file an appeal brief was not per se prejudicial where the respondent made no showing in his motion that the Immigration Judge erred in denying relief).
 
However, the respondent has demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his former attorney’s failure to inform him of the Board’s decision and voluntary departure date. By overstaying the period of voluntary departure, the respondent’s ability to adjust his status based upon his impending marriage to his United States citizen fiancee could be seriously impeded. See section 242B(e)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(e)(2)(1995) (stating that any alien allowed to depart voluntarily who remains in the United States after the scheduled date of departure, other than because of exceptional circumstances, shall not be eligible for certain forms of relief, including adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, for a period of 5 years after the scheduled date of departure).
 
*2 The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) argues that the respondent has failed to establish statutory eligibility for voluntary departure. Specifically, it asserts that the respondent is “clearly unwilling to depart” due to his recent engagement to a United States citizen, and that the respondent lacks a valid travel document. However, with his motion the respondent has submitted a copy of his current passport, along with an affidavit attesting to his willingness to depart voluntarily. Thus, as we find that the respondent established that his former attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to notify the respondent of his voluntary departure date, we will reopen proceedings to reinstate the period of voluntary departure.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and in accordance with our decision in Matter of Chouliaris, 16 I&N Dec. 168 (BIA 1977), the respondent is permitted to depart from the United States voluntarily within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security; and in the event of failure so to depart, the respondent shall be deported as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.

IN RE: DEVON AUGUSTUS PITTER
File: AXX XX8 135 - Baltimore
February 7, 2005
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David Goren, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal will be dismissed. The transcript of proceedings shows that the respondent, by counsel, conceded that he was subject to removal as an aggravated felon, having been convicted of a sexual offense involving a minor, and waived his right to appeal (Tr. at 5, 7). The Immigration Judge noted in his August 17, 2004, decision that the respondent had waived appeal. On September 13, 2004, the respondent nevertheless filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the appeal.
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(G) (summary dismissal of appeal appropriate where appeal is barred based on waiver of right to appeal). The respondent on the Notice of Appeal argues that his attorney did not adequately explain his options to him, and this led to his accepting the waiver. See Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001) (a party wishing to challenge the validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or an appeal directly with the Board). However, despite making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has complied with none of the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making such a claim. See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Stewart v. INS, 181 F.3d 587, 596 n. 9 (4th Cir. 1999).
 
In any event, the respondent’s brief states that he is seeking to have his conviction overturned through a motion in criminal court. However, such efforts to collaterally attack his conviction do not affect the respondent’s present removability. See generally Matter of Khalik, 17 I&N Dec. 518, 519 (BIA 1980); see also Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I&N Dec. 750, 752 (BIA 1993); Marino v. INS, 537 F.3d 686, 691-92 (2d Cir. 1976).
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

The respondent, a male native and citizen of Mexico, appealed from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 8, 2003. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and denied the respondent’s application for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s July 8, 2003, decision, pretermitting the respondent’s application for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent’s visa petition was not filed on or before April 30, 2001, as prescribed by section 245(i) of the Act. See 245(i)(1)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i)(1)(B)(i). Moreover, there is no evidence on the record that the respondent has an approved visa petition reflecting an immediately available visa. Accordingly, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent is statutorily ineligible to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act.
 
On appeal, the respondent maintains that a visa petition was not filed on or before April 30, 2001, due to the erroneous advice of prior counsel. The respondent claims that, as such, the Board should deem his visa petition as timely filed. Without regard to whether the respondent has established ineffective assistance of counsel in the present case, we find the respondent’s argument that he is entitled to such a remedy unavailing. The respondent’s reliance on Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000), to support his contention is inapposite. Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra, involved an alien whose counsel failed to timely file a suspension of deportation application before the deadline set by the Immigration Judge. Id. at 522. The present case, however, involves the respondent’s failure to file a visa petition application with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on or before April 30, 2001, a fixed statutory cut-off deadline set by Congress. To be “grandfathered” pursuant to section 245(i) of the Act, the respondent’s visa petition needed to be submitted on or before the requisite cut-off date, and be accepted as “properly filed” and “approvable when filed” by the DHS. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1245.10(a)(1)(i)(A), (2)(i), (3). The respondent urges the Board to constructively deem his visa petition as properly filed before the April 30, 2001, deadline. Because the DHS has sole jurisdiction in determining the sufficiency of visa petitions submitted pursuant to section 245(i) of the Act, we find that neither the Board nor an Immigration Judge has the jurisdiction to create the equitable remedy the respondent seeks. In view of the foregoing, the following orders shall be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to so depart, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Ruchi Thaker, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Richard VanVeldhuisen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondents have filed a motion to reconsider, in which they seek reconsideration of the Board’s August 20, 2004, decision. In our August 20, 2004, decision we denied a motion to reopen as untimely under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
In our prior order, we considered the respondents’ claim that prior counsel was incompetent, because prior counsel failed to inform them of the Board’s prior decision so they could file a timely motion to reopen. We determined that there was no basis for equitable tolling of the motions deadline, see Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 127, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000), because the motion to reopen was filed almost a year late, and the respondents did not say when they learned of the Board’s prior order. We also found that the respondents had failed to comply with Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
The respondents now say that they learned of the Board’s March 21, 2003, decision on December 16, 2003 (Motion to Reconsider, at p. 6; Lead Respondent’s Affidavit), and claim that they have complied with Matter of Assaad, supra, and Matter of Lozada, supra. The motion to reopen was not filed, however, until April 23, 2004, another 129 days after the respondents claim that they learned of our March 21, 2003, order. That the respondents failed to find counsel to advise them to file a motion to reopen more promptly, that was initially in compliance with the procedural requirements of Matter of Assaad, supra, and Matter of Lozada, supra, is not a basis for tolling the motions deadline for almost a year.
 
We also note that an alien must show that he was prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, supra; Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108, 110 (2d Cir. 1993). The Department of Labor issued an approved labor certification concerning the lead respondent on June 24, 2003, and the employment-based visa filed on the respondent’s behalf was approved on November 9, 2004 - both dates occurred after the time for filing a timely motion to reopen had expired. Therefore, no prejudice is shown in prior counsel allegedly not informing the respondent of the deadline for filing a motion to reopen.
 
*2 We could only reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), which the respondents urge us to do. We take this action only in “exceptional situations.” Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373 (A.G. 2002). We do not find that this is such an exceptional situation.
 
The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

File: AXX XX9 224 - Los Angeles
February 2, 2005
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Shan Potts, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves to reopen proceedings that concluded with this Board’s decision dated February 2, 1999. The motion is denied.
 
The respondent argues that he was not provided proper notice of the hearing that resulted in his in absentia order of removal. The respondent concedes that notice of hearing was mailed and actually received by his attorney of record. Service on a respondent’s attorney or representative of record constitutes proper service. 8 C.F.R. § 292.5.
 
The respondent alternatively argues that he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel because his former attorney of record did not effectively communicate the notice of hearing to the respondent. We have held that an alien must support a claim of ineffective assistance by a detailed affidavit, inform his previous attorney of the allegations of misconduct and provide the attorney with an opportunity to respond, and state whether a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to the attorney’s alleged violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), afff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Here, the applicant has not submitted any evidence to support his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has submitted an unsworn statement that fails to provide a sufficient factual basis for this Board to conclude that he was afforded ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, the respondent has failed to submit any evidence that he informed his former counsel of the complaint, and the “complaint” the respondent contends was filed with the appropriate disciplinary authority is an untranslated document that appears to be a form containing no statement describing the alleged misconduct. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.33 (regarding the submission of untranslated documents). See also, Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (Courts have held in similar situations that an alien was not required to fulfill procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, inasmuch as the record indicated a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance). We find that the respondent has failed to submit sufficient evidence to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eric G. Bjotvedt, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Arthur S. Raznick
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen has been filed out of time. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on June 22, 2004. The motion to reopen was filed late, on October 25, 2004. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposses the pending motion, which will be granted.
 
The respondent argues that the deadline for filing his motion to reopen should be tolled due to alleged ineffective assistance of 2 former attorneys. He argues that the attorney who represented him at the removal hearing failed to request on his behalf voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). The respondent further argues that the attorney who represented him on appeal did not claim that ineffective assistance of counsel caused him to forgo voluntary departure, and he consulted current counsel in September, 2004. Guided by Ninth Circuit precedent, we find that the respondent exercised diligence in submitting the pending motion, and the deadline for such motion should be tolled. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir.2003) (court found that to the extent that equitable tolling applies, based on actions of prior counsel, limitations period begins when respondent meets with new counsel).
 
As noted, the respondent claims that his former representatives provided ineffective assistance because he failed to apply for voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556, 561-62; (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988). In his affidavit, the respondent states that his first attorney, Robynn Mocek, agreed to help apply for any benefits that would avoid a deportation order. The respondent states that Mocek did not discuss the availability of voluntary departure. At the removal hearing, Mocek did not request voluntary departure, or discuss the issue. The DHS argues that it is “speculative” whether the respondent would have been granted such relief, had it been pursued at the removal hearing. However, the respondent appears to have met the basic requirements for such relief, and provides an affidavit attesting to as much. We note that voluntary departure is a form of relief that is regularly pursued and frequently granted, and there appears to be no reason why it was not sought in this case. On remand, the respondent will have an opportunity to pursue an application for voluntary departure.1 The DHS shall have the opportunity to examine and verify the validity of the respondent’s submissions and present evidence.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Elena E. Tsiprin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Tracy Nguyen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994)(noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The Immigration Judge correctly determined that the respondents received proper notice of their hearing scheduled for March 23, 2004. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondents contend that they established exceptional circumstances for their failure to appear due to the ineffective assistance of former counsel. Specifically, they assert that they had a serious misunderstanding with their former attorney, and that she failed to properly advise the respondents of their rights and responsibilities, including the necessity of their appearance at the hearing scheduled for March 23, 2004. The respondents submitted new evidence with the notice of appeal in support of their motion to reopen. The Board ordinarily will not consider any previously available evidence first proffered on appeal, as its review is limited to the record of proceedings before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995). Furthermore, although the respondents assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, they have not complied with all of the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Schneps, Barry C., Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reconsider our decision dated November 05, 2004. On November 5, 2004, this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the decision of the Immigration Judge which denied her motion to reopen. In that decision, the Board addressed the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and found that the respondent had not presented a claim under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (1988). The respondent has now filed a motion to reconsider that decision. The respondent has not established any error in our November 2004 decision. The merits of her claim related to ineffective counsel have been reargued. We note, however, that statements of counsel are not evidence. The respondent’s counsel argues that, because the respondent was represented by a non-attorney, she is not bound by the requirements of Lozada, supra. While we do not agree with this argument, we note that the respondent has failed to present any evidence related to the alleged ineffectiveness of representation other than a generalized statement that the individual did not advise her of the date of her hearing. We find this is insufficient to establish a claim of ineffective assistance. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Scott, Sandy E.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jason Aguilar
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent was properly notified of the hearing. The respondent argued that he complied with his obligation to keep the Immigration Court advised of his current address. He indicated that although he was in removal proceedings in San Francisco, California, documents were filed in Atlanta, Georgia, with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which contained the respondent’s correct address, and the DHS should have provided that information to the Immigration Court.
 
In Manjiyani v. INS, 324 F.3d 1138 (9th Cir. 2003), an alien was served with an Order to Show Cause in Seattle, Washington, but the charging document was not filed with the Immigration Court until 2 years later. Thereafter, the alien moved to California, and filed an application for adjustment of status with the DHS in Los Angeles, California. Those forms, however, did not indicate that the alien was served with an Order to Show Cause, and may have been in proceedings in Seattle, Washington. Subsequently, the Order to Show Cause was filed with the Immigration Court in Seattle, Washington, and was sent to the alien at his Washington address. An order of deportation was issued when the alien failed to appear for his hearing held in Seattle. The Ninth Circuit subsequently considered whether the alien had properly notified the DHS of his updated address thereby requiring it to notify the Seattle Immigration Court of the alien’s Los Angeles address. The court held, however, that the alien had not properly notified the DHS of a Change of address because the change was not submitted to the DHS office which issued the Order to Show Cause, and the alien did not inform the Los Angeles DHS office that the DHS office in Washington had issued an Order to Show Cause. Consequently, the Ninth Circuit found that the decision to deny reopening was correct.
 
In the instant case, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent had the responsibility to maintain a current address with the Immigration Court, and it was not the burden of the DHS to do so. The respondent herein was already in removal proceedings before an Immigration Judge. In addition, there is no indication that the respondent notified the DHS office in Atlanta, Georgia, that he was in proceedings in San Francisco. In this circumstance, DHS was not obligated to inform the Immigration Court of the respondent’s current address. Furthermore, the respondent infers that his former attorney may have been negligent for not submitting the respondent’s current address to the Immigration Court. The respondent has not, however, complied with the procedural requirements for a claim based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) and Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN RE: GIOVANNI GUERRERO SANTOS, BENEFICIARY OF A VISA PETITION FILED BY MARIA VERONICA PALOMA SANTOS, PETITIONER
File: AXX XX1 181 - San Francisco
January 27, 2005
 
IN VISA PETITION REVOCATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER:
 
Cynthia Scribe, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kelli J. Duehning
Associate Area Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Petition to classify status of alien relative for issuance of immigrant visa
 
*1 The petitioner filed on September 20, 1995, a visa petition on behalf of her husband, the beneficiary, to accord him immigration benefits as the spouse of a United States citizen under section 201(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1151(b). That petition was approved on July 27, 1999. The then Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), now abolished and its visa petitions functions transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS), sent the petitioner an undated Notice of Intent to Revoke in which it alleged that the beneficiary was barred under section 204(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c), from receiving a visa because his first marriage was a sham. The petitioner filed a rebuttal to that notice on April 20, 1999. On July 27, 1999, the INS acting district director revoked the petitioner’ previously approved visa. Counsel for the petitioner filed a Notice of Appeal, with a lengthy written appellate statement, on August 13, 1999, but did not accompany the appeal with a completed Notice of Appearance as Attorney.
 
On May 15, 2000, we returned the record of proceedings to the INS after finding that we lacked jurisdiction over the petitioner’s appeal because the appeal was not accompanied by a completed Notice of Appearance as Attorney (Form G-28). On June 13, 2000, the petitioner filed a timely motion to reconsider.¿FN1º In that motion, the petitioner argues that there is no specific regulation governing which Notice of Appearance must be filed with a visa petition appeal, counsel was not advised of the omission of the Notice of Appearance, and the petitioner should have been considered pro se on appeal rather than having her appeal returned without adjudication by the Board. The record of proceedings was not forwarded to the Board so this motion remains pending.
 
On May 10, 2004, the petitioner, through new counsel, filed a motion to reopen, alleging that she received ineffective assistance from her prior attorney whose alleged ineffectiveness resulted in her appeal not having been considered on the merits. We note that the arguments raised in her motion regarding the merits of her appeal are the same arguments that were raised by former counsel in the motion to reconsider. The DHS filed a response in opposition to the petitioner’s motion to which the petitioner filed a reply. The Board will reconsider sua sponte our May 15, 2000, decision. The Board’s May 15, 2000, decision will be vacated. The appeal will be dismissed. The June 13, 2000, motion to reconsider will be denied as moot. The May 10, 2004, motion to reopen will be denied.
 
*2 We find that the circumstances and procedural posture of this case warrant the reconsideration of our May 15, 2000, decision. We will therefore reconsider our decision sua sponte. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We further find that our May 15, 2000, decision should be vacated and the petitioner’s appeal reinstated.¿FN2º As we are reconsidering our decision on our own authority, the petitioner’s June 13, 2000, motion to reconsider will be denied as moot.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the INS acting district director erred in revoking her previously approved petition because substantial and probative evidence does not support a finding that the beneficiary’s first marriage was a sham. She contends that the characterizations of the beneficiary’s first wife’s statements that she never lived with the beneficiary and had been paid to marry him are inaccurate. She asserts that there is no literal confession from the beneficiary’s first wife in the record and that the beneficiary’s first wife’s statements regarding receiving $3,000 from the beneficiary and being promised an additional $3,000 does not explicitly indicate that the money was provided so that the beneficiary could obtain legal residency and could have been a loan or a gift. She notes that the beneficiary was not questioned about the money that he provided to his first wife. In addition, the petitioner argues that the beneficiary’s first wife’s statements were obtained only after she twice denied having been paid to marry the beneficiary and then having been threatened with arrest. She asserts that it can be inferred from the record that the beneficiary’s first wife may have felt coerced into stating that the beneficiary gave her money.
 
We find that substantial and probative evidence supports the revocation of the petitioner’s previously approved visa petition and subjects the beneficiary to the section 204(c) bar which prohibits the approval of a visa petition on his behalf. See 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(1)(ii) (2004). We therefore affirm the decision of the INS acting district director. The petitioner explains that the money paid by the beneficiary to his first wife may have been a loan or a gift and was not explicitly identified as having been in return for engaging in a sham marriage. We agree with the INS acting district director’s thorough discussion of this argument, as well as of the argument that the beneficiary’s first wife may have felt coerced by the INS interview examiner. The petitioner’s statements on appeal do not persuade us that the INS acting district director erred or that his decision should be overturned. For these reasons, we agree with the INS acting district director that the beneficiary’s first marriage was a sham marriage entered into in order to provide an immigration benefit. We further agree with the acting district director that as a result of having entered into a sham marriage, the beneficiary cannot have a visa petition approved on his behalf due to the prohibition contained in section 204(c) of the Act.
 
*3 We next turn to the petitioner’s motion to reopen in which she alleges that she received ineffective assistance from her former attorney regarding the proper filing of her appeal. The petitioner has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Former counsel responded to the petitioner’s allegations by stating that he filed a motion to reconsider with the Board, listing the reasons why he felt that the Board’s decision contained error, and indicating that, following the Board’s February 10, 2004, decision in the beneficiary’s deportation case, he spoke with the beneficiary regarding the various options that were available to him. He also indicated in his response that the Board’s February 10, 2004, decision did not reflect that the Board had considered the motion to reconsider that he had filed. As noted above, the motion to reconsider was not forwarded to the Board for adjudication of the motion. The motion to reconsider was discovered in the record of the visa petition revocation proceedings after the record was forwarded to the Board due to the filing of the petitioner’s May 10, 2004, motion to reopen. We find that the petitioner has not shown that she was prejudiced by her former attorney’s actions because she has not shown that the outcome may have been different but for her former counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
Finally, we note that the petitioner includes a variety of documents relating to the merits of her visa petition. She does not claim that these documents are new or previously unavailable or undiscoverable. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Nor does she contend that all of these documents are material to the key issue of whether the beneficiary’s first marriage was entered into in order to evade the immigration laws. Likewise, the petitioner does not argue that these documents would have been submitted to the INS but for the alleged ineffectiveness of former counsel. It therefore appears that the petitioner also seeks to have her visa petition revocation proceedings reopened in order to provide these documents to further support her visa petition. We find that the submission of these documents do not warrant the reopening of the visa petition revocation proceedings because the petitioner does not claim that any alleged ineffectiveness by former counsel prevented these documents from being submitted and has not shown that the documents are new, previously unavailable or undiscoverable, or material to the issue of the bona fides of the beneficiary’s first marriage.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered:
 
ORDER: The Board is reconsidering sua sponte our May 15, 2000, decision.
 
*4 FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s May 15, 2000, decision is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The petitioner’s appeal is reinstated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The petitioner’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The petitioner’s June 13, 2000, motion to reconsider is denied as moot.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The petitioner’s May 10, 2004, motion to reopen is denied.

The motion to reconsider contains a fee stamp from the INS, where the motion was filed with the fee which was collected by INS. It is standard practice for motions filed in visa petition and visa petition revocation cases to be filed with the INS, now CIS, because that agency is responsible for the collection of fees associated with motions in such cases and is also the agency with custody of the record of proceedings in such cases.

2

The petitioner included, as an attachment to her motion to reopen, a new Notice of Appeal completed by present counsel. The arguments made in that appeal are the same arguments that were made in the original Notice of Appeal filed by former counsel. It is unnecessary for us to address the merits of this new Notice of Appeal because we have vacated our prior order and reinstated the petitioner’s original appeal.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Nadeem H. Makada, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Larry J. Gallagher
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On October 26, 2004, this Board dismissed the respondents’ appeal. The respondents now move the Board to reopen the removal proceedings claiming ineffective assistance of their prior counsel. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondents contend that their former counsel did not represent them adequately before the Immigration Judge during the hearing on their applications for cancellation of removal.
 
In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), we stated that “before allegations of ineffectiveness are presented to the Board, former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond. Any subsequent response from counsel, or report of counsel’s failure or refusal to respond should be submitted with the motion” (emphasis added). We noted that the high standard which we enunciated was necessary if the Board is to have a basis for assessing the substantial number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that come before us. Id. It is crucial that former counsel be given “the opportunity to respond to the allegation¿sº of ineffectiveness,” due to the charges made by the respondents. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598-99 (9th Cir. 2004) (notification to counsel is “required” for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and complaint letter to California State Bar with notation “cc” to opposing counsel does not satisfy the requirement).
 
However, we have no statement or affidavit from former counsel, giving her version of events, and thus no way to assess the validity of the claim. See also Ponce-Leiva v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 3369 (3rd Cir. 2003) (A requirement of Lozada includes filing a motion and giving the allegedly ineffective counsel an opportunity to respond). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated that rigid adherence to the Lozada requirements is not always required, see Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir.2002) (Lozada “factors are not rigidly applied, especially when the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance”). The record in the instant case does not show “a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance.” Former counsel appeared at the hearing with the respondents and submitted substantial evidence on their behalf including an affidavit from the male respondent. Former counsel also made a closing argument on behalf of the respondents.
 
*2 We note that the respondents wrote a letter dated November 23, 2004, to their former counsel notifying her that a complaint with the California Bar had been filed against her. There is no evidence, however, that the respondents notified previous counsel that (1) the respondents filed a motion to reopen with the Board based upon her claimed ineffective assistance, and (2) that she was given the opportunity to respond to the respondents’ motion to reopen. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra. The need for notification and response from former counsel (or report that she was notified but failed to respond) is critical to our meaningful assessment of this claim. Reyes v. Ashcroft, supra. See also Azanor v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 1013, 1023 (9th Cir. 2004). In accord, Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 9 (3rd Cir. 2004).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Martin J. Lawler, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Michelle Guardino
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; cancellation of removal
 
This case was last before the Board on August 3, 2004, when we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s May 28, 2003, decision denying the respondent’s applications for cancellation of removal and granting the respondent voluntary departure. On October 8, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel and seeking new relief in the form of adjustment of status based upon the pending visa petition which had been recently filed by her 21-year-old son.
 
The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposed the motion, arguing that the respondent is statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status because she overstayed the period of voluntary departure. See section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. However, the respondent asserts that she never received the Board’s decision, and that her attorney of record at the time claims that he never received the decision, either. The respondent explains that she only learned about the decision after the expiration of the voluntary departure period, in the process of seeking adjustment of status through her current attorney.
 
Pursuant to the “Stipulation of Settlement and Remand Order” issued by the United States District Court in the Northern District of California on December 20, 2004, we will vacate our prior order and re-issue our decision with today’s date to restart the period of voluntary departure.¿FN1º
 
Turning now to the respondent’s appeal, we adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
With regard to the motion to reopen, the respondent has submitted evidence that her son has filed a visa petition on her behalf (Form I-130), and she has submitted a copy of her application for adjustment as well (Form I-485). Although the petition has not yet been approved, we have held that unless clear ineligibility is apparent in the record, the Board shall generally grant motions to reopen in cases involving an application for adjustment of status filed simultaneously with a visa petition where, as here, approval would make the visa immediately available at the time of filing. See Matter of Garcia, 16 I&N Dec. 653 (BIA 1978), modified on other grounds, Matter of Arthur, 20 I&N Dec. 475 (BIA 1992); 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(2)(i)(B). The DHS has only opposed the motion based upon grounds which have been mooted by the district court stipulation. Accordingly, the motion will be granted.
 
*2 ORDER: The Board’s August 3, 2004, decision is hereby vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

The district court has instructed the Board to issue a new order which “shall be identical in text to the Board’s August 3, 2004, order; provided, however, that the new order shall bear a new date ….” However, given the fact that the respondent has since filed a motion to remand, which we are granting, it is more administratively expedient to re-issue the appeal with a new date and adjudicate the motion in the same order.

IN RE: JEFFREY BROWN OWEN
File: AXX XX6 402 - Los Angeles

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Valerie Curtis-Diop, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeffrey C. Finnegan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; adjustment of status
 
The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has appealed an Immigration Judge’s decision granting the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings and granting him adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255. The respondent has filed an opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained.
 
The record reflects that the respondent, a 55-year-old native and citizen of New Zeland, entered the United States as a visitor for pleasure, but remained beyond the authorized period of time. On January 28, 1998, an Immigration Judge granted the respondent voluntary departure under section 240B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c, until May 28, 1998. On May 24, 1998, the respondent married his United States citizen wife. Subsequently, on May 27, 1998, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and a request for a stay of removal with the Immigration Court. The Immigration Judge granted the stay of removal on May 28, 1998.
 
The DHS opposed the motion to reopen arguing, inter alia, that the motion was untimely filed and that the respondent was barred from applying for adjustment because he had overstayed his voluntary departure period. Matter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996), aff’d, Shaar v. INS, 141 F.3d 953 (9th Cir. 1998). The record also reflects that the Immigration Judge gave the respondent several opportunities to supplement his motion as it lacked specific supporting documentation. The Immigration Judge eventually granted the respondent’s motion to reopen without a written decision, and granted the respondent’s application for adjustment of status as the spouse of a United States citizen. The DHS’s appeal follows.
 
Upon review of the record, we note that the Immigration Judge erred in granting the respondent’s motion to reopen. As a preliminary matter, the motion to reopen was untimely filed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (providing that a motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final admnistrative decision was rendered). In addition, the respondent was statutorily ineligible to pursue adjustment of status because he had failed to depart from the United States within his previously-granted period of voluntary departure and presented no evidence that the DHS had extended that voluntary departure period. Matter of Shaar, supra.
 
*2 By statute, an alien who is permitted to depart voluntarily and fails to depart during the time period specified is ineligible to pursue adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, as well as other specified forms of relief. Section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(a); see also Matter of Shaar, supra. Authority to extend the period of voluntary departure after it has been granted by either the Immigration Judge or the Board is only within the jurisdiction of the DHS. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(f). A stay request is entirely unrelated to request for an extension of the period of voluntary departure. Compare 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(f) (relating to extension of voluntary departure period) with 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(f) (relating to requests for a stay pending resolution of a motion).
 
Regardless of whether the respondent’s prior attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel, the Immigration Judge may not grant reopening to allow the respondent to seek relief for which he is statutorily ineligible. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). The respondent’s motion before the Immigration Judge contained no evidence that the respondent’s voluntary departure period had been extended by the DHS, and he therefore became statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status once he failed to depart during the original voluntary departure period. Although we are sympathetic to the respondent’s plight, we are without authority to provide a remedy. Consequently, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied, and the Immigration Judge’s decision granting the application for adjustment of status will be vacated.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied, and the Immigration Judge’s decision granting the application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act is vacated.

File: AXX XX2 355 - San Pedro
January 18, 2005
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal is dismissed. The transcript of proceedings shows that the respondent, through counsel, waived appeal (Tr. at 13). The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had waived appeal. On September 27, 2004, the respondent nevertheless filed a Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26).
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision became administratively final upon the respondent’s waiver of the right to appeal, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case. See Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.39; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(G) (summary dismissal of appeal appropriate where appeal is barred based on waiver of right to appeal). The respondent makes no claim that the appeal waiver was invalid.
 
The respondent has filed motions arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at the removal hearing, because his former counsel did not pursue cancellation of removal under 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) on his behalf, after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued its decision in Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, 382 F.3d 905 (9th Cir. 2004), days before the final removal hearing (that case limited which crimes are classified as “aggravated felonies”, which preclude such relief). Since we lack jurisdiction to address the respondent’s appeal, we also lack jurisdiction to address the motions filed with the Board subsequent to the respondent’s appeal. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); see also Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). We also note that the respondent has failed to comply with any of the requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, under Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The motions are denied for lack of jurisdiction and the record of proceeding is returned to the Immigration Court without further Board action.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Seth L. Reszko, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Charles W. Baccus
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent appealed from the Immigration Judge’s March 16, 2004, decision finding that his February 4, 2004, motion was untimely, that he did not comply with the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and that Singh v. INS, 295 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir. 2002), was distinguishable from the respondent’s case. We find the respondent’s assertions to the contrary to be without merit.
 
The record reflects that the respondent and his attorney were personally served with notice of the October 16, 2003, hearing. The respondent did not appear; his attorney did. In an October 23, 2003, motion to reopen, the respondent claimed that his former spouse failed to advise him of the date of the hearing. On December 31, 2003, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen, finding no exceptional circumstances.
 
The respondent filed a new motion to reopen on January 22, 2004, claiming that his attorney failed to advise him or remind him of the date of his hearing, and alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. On February 3, 2004, the Immigration Judge denied that motion as number barred.
 
On February 4, 2004, subsequent to the Immigration Judge’s decision, the respondent filed a motion requesting that the prior motion be considered a Motion to Reconsider and again claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. We note, however, that the respondent’s motion had already been considered and denied by the Immigration Judge prior to the receipt of this motion. Moreover, although the respondent attempted to claim that this was a motion to reconsider, it is clearly a motion to reopen, as it presented new and previously unavailable evidence.
 
On March 16, 2004, the Immigration Judge denied the February 4, 2004, motion, noting that it was untimely, and even if timely, should be denied.
 
Upon our review of the record, we find that the February 4, 2004, motion to reopen was actually a separate or new motion from the January 22, 2004, motion to reopen. Although the respondent attempted to use the February 4, 2004, motion to amend the January 22, 2004, motion to reopen, it was received too late. Thus, the Immigration Judge correctly concluded that it was barred by regulation.
 
*2 Turning next to the respondent’s claim that he was ineffectively represented by counsel, we note once again that there is no evidence in the record to support that claim for the respondent had personal service of the hearing notice. Singh v. INS, supra, is therefore distinguishable from this case. Moreover, the respondent did not file a bar complaint in compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), until after the Immigration Judge had already denied the motion to reopen. The appeal is dismissed.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Oltarsh, Jennifer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Virna Wright
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The record reflects that the respondent was ordered deported in absentia on October 1, 1993, and filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on April 23, 2004. In a decision dated April 28, 2004, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion. The respondent has appealed that decision. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(b). The appeal is dismissed.
 
The respondent argued on appeal that he was misled by his former counsel that it was not necessary for him to appear for his hearing because he was the recipient of a nonimmigrant visa. He contended that he is the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and he should not be penalized for the negligent advice given to him by his lawyer. We find that the respondent has failed to establish that reopening of these proceedings based on “exceptional circumstances” is appropriate.
 
A request for rescission of an order of removal based on “exceptional circumstances” must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal. See section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252B(c)(3)(A). Because a request for reopening based on “exceptional circumstances” was not made within 180 days of the date of the respondent’s order of deportation, it is barred from consideration. See also Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998); Matter of A-A, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998) (holding that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day statutory limit for the filing of a motion to reopen to rescind an in absentia order of deportation under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act on the basis of exceptional circumstances). The decision of the Immigration Judge is affirmed.
 
We further will not toll the statute of limitations for seeking reopening pursuant to Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2nd Cir. 2000). Therein, the court recognized the doctrine of “equitable tolling” of the statute of limitations regarding the filing of a motion to reopen. The court held that an alien must demonstrate not only that the alien’s constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll. Id. In that case, the court concluded that the alien failed to demonstrate such diligence, and concluded that equitable tolling did not apply. Id.
 
*2 Accordingly, under Iavorski v. INS, supra, the Board must first address whether the respondent was denied due process in these proceedings based upon the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved applicant setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the applicant in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640.
 
In the instant case, we have reviewed the documents submitted with the instant motion and find that the respondent has not shown that he was the Victim of negligence. We note that the record contains a complaint filed against the respondent’s former counsel with the New York Bar Association. Therein, the respondent acknowledged that he was aware of his deportation hearing, and indicated that counsel put him under the impression that it was not necessary to attend the hearing because of the availability of the H1-B visa. It is not clear as to exactly what counsel did or said to give the respondent that impression. However, we note that the respondent did not allege in the complaint that he was instructed by counsel that he need not appear for the hearing. It therefore appears that the respondent has not presented sufficient evidence establishing a clear and obvious. case of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
Even if the respondent’s counsel was negligent, we cannot find that the respondent exercised due diligence in seeking reopening. The respondent indicated in the New York Bar Association complaint that he was stopped by immigration inspectors in 2002 while attempting to enter the United States. He indicated that the inspectors told him that there was a pending deportation order, but apparently admitted the respondent after the respondent explained to them his belief that his immigration status was lawful. Inasmuch as the respondent was clearly on notice in 2002 that he may have been subject to a 1993 deportation order, it was incumbent upon him to then make prompt inquiries into his status. His failure to do so until 2004 is presumptive proof of his failure to exercise due diligence in seeking reopening of proceedings. Equitable tolling of the statute of limitations is therefore inappropriate.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Noemi Ramirez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julia Chimarusti
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before the Board on October 29, 2004, when we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s adverse decision, and granted the respondents voluntary departure. The respondents have filed a timely motion asserting that the Board erred in finding that they had not demonstrated exceptional and extremely unusual hardship for purposes of cancellation of removal, and that they did not have effective assistance of counsel during the proceeding below.
 
That aspect of the respondents’ motion which asserts that the Board committed error in denying their application for cancellation of removal is in the nature of a motion to reconsider, while their assertion that their former representatives afforded them ineffective assistance of counsel is a motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. The sole form of relief sought by the respondents is cancellation of removal. However, pursuant to section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), an alien who fails to depart following a grant of voluntary departure, and who has been provided written notice of the consequences of remaining in the United States, is statutorily barred from applying for certain forms of discretionary relief. We find that the respondents are barred from applying for cancellation of removal by section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d). An alien who remains in the United States after the scheduled date of departure is statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief. Therefore, because the respondents have remained in the United States after the scheduled date of departure, the respondents are now statutorily ineligible for the relief sought.
 
Moreover, for the respondents’ benefit we note that even if their motion were not otherwise barred, they have not complied with any of the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, including informing either of their former representatives of the allegations against them and affording them an opportunity to respond. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637(BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); see also Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000); Ramirez-Durazo v. INS, 794 F.2d 491 (9th Cir. 1986). As such, this aspect of their motion would not have warranted reopening.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James T. Reynolds, Esquire
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Ghana, moves the Board to reconsider our decision dated September 8, 2004. On September 8, 2004, this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the decision of the Immigration Judge which denied her motion to reopen. In that decision, the Board addressed the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and found that the respondent had not presented a claim under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (1988). The Board did not acknowledge in the September decision that the respondent’s counsel had been reprimanded. We find that the reprimand of the respondent’s counsel is sufficient under these facts to establish a case for ineffective assistance under Lozada, supra. For that reason, the motion to reconsider will be granted. However, the respondent’s motion to reopen filed below was untimely in that it was more than 180 days after the in absentia order of the Immigration Judge. There is no evidence that the respondent was prevented by her attorney’s fraud from complying with the deadline and, therefore, equitable tolling does not apply. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000). Accordingly, the decision of the Immigration Judge is affirmed.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The decision of the Board dated September 8, 2004, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The decision of the Immigration Judge is affirmed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nicolmedes E. Suriel, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Linda I. Orji,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated May 6, 2004, in which he denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia for his failure to appear for the hearing on November 19, 2003. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded.
 
The Immigration Judge determined that although the respondent complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), the respondent failed to establish exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear since the in absentia removal order was a consequence of his own doing. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s conduct did not reflect that he acted diligently and in good faith since he waited until about a week before his hearing to seek immigration advice from an assistant at a tax accounting firm, and he elected not to attend his hearing when the “licenciado” failed to meet him on the morning of the hearing.
 
On appeal and in the motion to reopen, the respondent contends that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances due to ineffective assistance of counsel. He asserts that he did not receive the hearing notice until the first week in November 2003, and that he contacted Ms. Ingrid Osses at M.A.S. group in Flagstaff, Arizona, because he had heard that this office assisted people with their immigration matters. Furthermore, the respondent believed that Ms. Osses was an attorney, since she had informed him of this fact. Ms. Osses apparently agreed to represent the respondent in Immigration Court on November 19, 2003, but she failed to meet the respondent at her office as she had promised. As Ms. Osses had all of the respondent’s immigration documents, including the hearing notice with the Immigration Court’s address, he contends that he did not attend the hearing because he did not have the Immigration Court’s address and he did not know what to do in her absence. With his motion to reopen, the respondent submitted numerous documents, including his own affidavit; the affidavit of Dena Neese, an attorney at the Law offices of Nicomedes E. Suriel; and the affidavit of Don Rosales, who employed Ms. Osses at the time of the respondent’s contact with her. Mr. Rosales states that he discovered that Ms. Osses apparently was representing herself as an attorney, and she later left his business without informing anyone and took many client files with her.
 
We have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996). In the case at bar, the respondent had hired Ms. Osses to represent him before the Immigration Judge, believing her to be an attorney. Furthermore, she failed to meet the respondent to accompany him to the Immigration Court on the day of his hearing, and she apparently had retained all of his immigration papers, including his hearing notice.
 
*2 We find that the respondent has presented a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The record in the instant case supports the conclusion that based on the totality of circumstances, the respondent has established exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. We disagree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent failed to act diligently and in good faith. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen, and he has complied with all of the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. Moreover, the respondent’s reliance, upon Ms. Osses’ perceived expertise was not unreasonable under the circumstances. Based upon the respondent’s motion to reopen and the evidence submitted in support thereof, we find that the respondent has presented a valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and the proceedings will be reopened and remanded for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Patrick G. Tzeuton, Esq.
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Leslie Smith Turner
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 17, 2003. In removal proceedings, at which the respondent was present and represented by counsel, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s request for voluntary departure. The respondent filed a motion to reopen, claiming that her counsel did not explain the full meaning of voluntary departure, and that she fears persecution in her native country. The Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding that the respondent’s claims were not fully supported by her affidavit, and that the respondent had not set forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that is compliant with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Along with her appeal, the respondent submits a motion to reopen and reconsider with an additional affidavit regarding her claim of persecution. She states that she did not file a bar complaint against her former counsel because her efforts were aimed at stopping her removal, and not at disciplinary actions against her former attorney.
 
A motion to reopen based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, supra. See Matter of Santos, 19 I&N Dec. 105, 107-09 (BIA 1984). In the instant case, the respondent has not met any of these requirements. She has not offered a detailed statement of her agreement with her counsel, she has not shown that she informed her counsel of the allegations against her, and her explanation as to why she did not file a complaint against her former counsel is inadequate. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel. We find no basis to reopen or reconsider her additional evidence in support of her claim of persecution.
 
While the respondent’s appeal was pending before us, she submitted a motion for reconsideration of our order summarily affirming the Immigration Judge’s decision. We have not rendered such an order in her case. We find no basis to address the respondent’s latest motion. Accordingly, the respondent’s motions are denied, and the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vlad Kuzmin, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent’s motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied.1
 
A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed within 90 days of the administratively final order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). On March 14, 2002, the Board summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s June 8, 1999, denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen the removal proceedings pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii). The respondent submitted the current motion to reopen, through counsel, a year after the Board dismissed his appeal.
 
Underlying the motion is first a claim of ineffective assistance of the respondent’s former appellate attorney. The respondent in his motion claims that former counsel failed to submit a separate brief and as a result of such failure, the respondent’s appeal was summarily dismissed by the Board. The respondent also asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during his removal proceedings before the Immigration Judge. In this regard, the respondent asserts that his former counsel failed to notify him of his hearing date which subsequently resulted in an in absentia order of removal being issued by the Immigration Judge on November 18, 1998.
 
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held that the filing deadline for motions with the Board may receive the benefit of “equitable tolling” where an alien has demonstrated not only that their constitutional right to due process have been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll. Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 135 (2d Cir. 2000). Here, however, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that he exercised diligence in this matter. Although the respondent correctly notes in his affidavit that his former appellate counsel has been suspended from practicing before the Executive Office for Immigration Review, he respondent has offered no explanation as to why his motion was filed late. The respondent’s original motion papers and subsequent filings do not address why his motion was filed long after the expiration of the 90 days allowed for a motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: ENRIQUE AISPURO-PENA
File: AXX XX1 697 - San Francisco
January 7, 2005
*1 DISSENTING OPINION: Lauri Steven Filppu, Board Member
I respectfully dissent.
 
The record shows that the respondent was apprehended while attempting to cross the border near San Diego, California. In order to obtain a change of venue to San Francisco, he admitted the charges in the Notice to Appear (NTA) through prior counsel. The Department of Homeland Security, (DHS), thus, was not required to offer proof, through testimony of the arresting officer, to establish its allegations.
 
Nevertheless, Exhibit 9 reflects that the respondent admitted his false citizenship claim when again apprehended by DHS after issuance of the in absentia removal order. The respondent understandably wishes to withdraw his admissions. However, absent a meaningful showing by the respondent that the charges are false, I do not believe he has shown the requisite prejudice to be allowed to withdraw the admissions made by prior counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (requiring a showing of substantive prejudice as part of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim).
 
I would dismiss the appeal.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 Now before us is the respondent’s motion to reopen, filed October 22, 2004. The motion to reopen will be denied. Previously, in a decision dated July 27, 2004, the Board summarily affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision ordering him removed to El Salvador with an alternative grant of voluntary departure. The respondent was notified, in writing, that he was allowed 30 days from the date of that decision in which to depart the United States voluntarily and further, of the penalties attendant to his failure to do so in the absence of any extension.
 
By means of his current motion, the respondent requests reopening for the purpose of renewing an application for relief from removal and adjustment of status, and asserting ineffective assistance of counsel. In this regard, the Board notes that a motion to reopen must, among other things, state the new facts to be considered at the reopened hearing and must be supported by affidavits or other evidence. Matter of Gutierrez, 21 I&N Dec. 479, 482 (BIA 1996). Such a motion may not be granted unless the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). In addition, an alien must establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought before a motion to reopen will be granted. Matter of Gutierrez, supra.
 
Importantly, in this case the motion was filed well after the last day of the respondent’s voluntary departure period and failed to reflect any extension of voluntary departure time. Pursuant to section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), an alien who fails to depart following a grant of voluntary departure, and who has been provided written notice of the consequences of remaining in the United States, is statutorily barred from applying for a period of 10 years for any further relief under this section and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249. There is no statutory exception to this 10-year preclusion of relief under current law. Further, although the respondent alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, he does not specifically allege that he was advised by counsel to remain in the United States after the expiration of his voluntary departure period or any extensions thereof. The respondent, thus, is barred from receiving special rule cancellation of removal and adjustment of status because of his failure to comply with the terms of his grant of voluntary departure.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

ORDER:
 
PER CURIAM. The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s July 22, 2003, decision ordering him removed from the United States based on concessions and admissions made by a former attorney in a written change of venue motion submitted in September 2001. We note that the respondent’s former attorney initially contested the charges in the Notice to Appear, including the charge under section 212(a)(6)(A)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, i.e., making a false claim of United States citizenship (Tr. at 3). This attorney, Juan Castro, later inexplicably admitted and conceded the allegations and charges in the above-referenced written pleading. Thereafter, the attorney neglected to inform the respondent of a scheduled court date, which resulted first in the entry of an in absentia order of removal, and then in the withdrawal of that order pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s granting of the respondent’s motion to reopen due to ineffective assistance of counsel. See February 5, 2002, and July 22, 2003, orders. As part of the respondent’s application for reopening in which he invoked our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), the respondent’s new attorney submitted materials indicating that the former attorney, Mr. Castro, has resigned from the practice of law. See Exh. 8. Notwithstanding all of the above, the Immigration Judge refused to allow the respondent to enter new pleadings in response to the charges in the Notice to Appeal. In fact, the concession to the highly-prejudicial charge of making a false claim of United States citizenship still stands, which could eliminate the chance of the respondent ever adjusting his status to live with his citizen wife and children. The respondent argued, through his new attorney, that he should not be held to the written pleadings of his former attorney, when those pleadings were inconsistent with the original position taken by the respondent and clearly prejudicial to the respondent’s case. We agree. In this case, given the clear evidence of ineffective assistance provided by Mr. Castro, we do not believe it is appropriate to hold the respondent to pleadings where there is no indication that those pleadings were the result of a carefully considered choice by the respondent, as opposed to careless work by a former attorney whose representation has been called into question. Accordingly, we find it appropriate to vacate the Immigration Judge’s July 22, 2003, order, and remand this case for further proceedings.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s February 25, 2004, decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings and rescind the in absentia order of removal entered on November 6, 2003. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has filed an opposition. The appeal will be sustained.
 
We adopt the findings of fact set forth by the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 1-2). The Immigration Judge found that a Notice of Hearing was personally served on the respondent’s counsel and that the respondent was orally warned of the consequences of failing to appear for his November 6, 2003, hearing. The Immigration Judge did not specifically find that the respondent was given oral notice of the time of his hearing on November 6, 2003. The respondent asserts that he thought the hearing was at 1:00 p.m. as his prior hearings had been, and claims that his attorney did not give him a copy of the Notice of Hearing or inform him that the hearing time was 8:30 a.m. He submitted an affidavit from his former counsel stating that she did not inform the respondent that his hearing time was 8:30 a.m.
 
An order of removal entered in absentia may be rescinded if the respondent demonstrates that the failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Receiving ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute exceptional circumstances. Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996). The respondent has sufficiently complied with the requirements outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). Specifically, the affidavit of the respondent’s former counsel concedes her obligation to inform the respondent of his hearing time. The respondent has also demonstrated that he filed a bar complaint with respect to this matter. The respondent attended all of his prior hearings, including a merits hearing at which he presented the testimony of witnesses, he has demonstrated that he lacked actual notice of the time of the hearing due to his counsel’s failure to inform him of such, he is a long-time resident of the United States, and he appears prima facie eligible for relief from removal. Under these circumstances, we conclude that counsel’s failure to ensure that the respondent received a copy of the Notice of Hearing or to otherwise inform him that his hearing time was 8:30 a.m. constitutes exceptional circumstances warranting rescission of the in absentia removal order and reopening of his removal proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Philippe Dwelshauvers, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen exceeds the numerical limitations for motions to reopen and will be denied. This is the third motion to reopen filed in the instant case. Two prior motions were denied by the Immigration Judge on March 9, 1999, and on February 14, 2001, respectively.1 The regulations provide that motions to reopen shall be limited to one motion to reopen, with certain exceptions not pertinent here. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion to reopen is therefore barred by numerical limitations.
 
The respondent makes a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and claims he is eligible to have his case equitably tolled due to the ineffective assistance he received from a notary public holding himself out as an attorney. The respondent has filed an affidavit attesting to the chain of events leading up to the instant motion. We note also, that because the respondent’s former representative was not an attorney, there is no need for further compliance with the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We note also, for an untimely motion to reopen to receive the benefit of equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien must exercise due diligence in pursuing the case during the period to be tolled. The last order issued in this case was in 2002. Inasmuch as the respondent has waited 2 years before filing the instant motion, he has not exercised due diligence in pursuing remedies available to him with regards to the alleged ineffective assistance violations.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reopen is denied.

The final administrative order was issued by the Immigration Judge on December 16, 1998, when he granted the respondent 40 days within which to voluntarily leave the United States. While the Board did issue an order on November 21, 2002, denying respondent’s appeal, the appeal that was pending before the Board was not an appeal of an underlying merits decision, but rather, an appeal of a denial of the earlier motion to reopen. Because respondent’s motion to reopen was never granted, he is still under the final administrative order of deportation issued by the Immigration Judge.

*1 In an order entered on May 26, 2004, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings on October 7, 2004. The Department of Homeland Security has not registered opposition to the motion, and it will be granted.
 
The respondent argues that his former counsel, David A. Diaz, provided ineffective assistance of counsel. It is argued that Mr. Diaz failed to obtain and present pertinent evidence regarding the hardship to the respondent’s qualifying relatives, regarding his application for cancellation of removal. It is also maintained that Mr. Diaz failed to file an appellate brief, although he had been retained to do so. Further, it is alleged that Mr. Diaz failed to inform the respondent of the Board’s order, which resulted in the expiration of the period of voluntary departure.
 
The respondent has provided a printout of punitive action taken against Mr. Diaz by the California State Bar, of which he is a member. The printout reveals several actions in the last several years, in which Mr. Diaz has been ordered inactive or suspended outright from the practice of law. On June 12, 2004, Mr. Diaz was ordered inactive and then “not entitled.” On September 16, 2004, Mr. Diaz was suspended.
 
Generally, respondents in immigration proceedings are bound by the actions of their counsel, absent egregious circumstances. In this case, Mr. Diaz’s record as a practicing attorney in California gives rise to a question as to the quality of representation that he provided the respondent, particularly in view of the dire consequences of failing voluntarily to depart.
 
The respondent has raised serious allegations concerning the quality of Mr. Diaz’s representation, and he has substantially complied with the requirements we set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182 (9th Cir. 2004); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Accordingly, we deem it appropriate to grant the motion to reopen and remand this case for another hearing. The respondent should be afforded the opportunity to present evidence regarding his eligibility and worthiness for the discretionary relief of cancellation of removal. We note that the respondent has presented compelling evidence with his motion regarding hardship to a qualifying relative for purposes of cancellation of removal. The Immigration Judge should issue a new decision either granting or denying the requested relief. The respondent’s removability is settled and need not be revisited.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is granted, the proceedings are reopened, and the appeal is reinstated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s order of May 26, 2004, is vacated; except as to the issue of removability, the Immigration Judge’s decision is also vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and for the issuance of a new decision.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rhoshunda R. Rhodes
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent submitted a motion to reopen his proceedings conducted in absentia, claiming that he switched the dates for his state court hearing and his immigration court hearing in his notebook, and that he was absent due to this error. On October 24, 2003, the Immigration Judge denied the motion, finding that the respondent had not established exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear. Seven months later, the respondent filed a motion for reconsideration and a motion for sua sponte reopening. He claimed that his right to due process was violated because he was forced to run between his state court proceedings and his immigration court proceedings. He claimed that he was not placed in immigration proceedings for a violation of the immigration laws, but rather on the basis of the withdrawal of the visa petition filed on his behalf and his pursuit of a child protection order in state court. He claims that errors by his former attorney denied him the opportunity to pursue relief from removal, and that his failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances. On August 3, 2004, the Immigration Judge denied the motions. He found that the respondent had proper notice of his hearing, that his scheduling error did not establish exceptional circumstances, and that the motion for reconsideration was not timely filed. We agree. We further find that the respondent has not shown that he is prima facie eligible for relief from removal, and he has not presented a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that is compliant with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent has failed to establish a basis for reconsideration. He has not shown that sua sponte reopening is warranted in his case. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Relief under NACARA; remand
 
The respondent has appealed an Immigration Judge’s decision, dated March 12, 2001, denying his application for relief under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (“NACARA”), Title II of Pub. L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2193 (1997), amended by Pub. L. No. 105-139, 111 Stat. 2644 (1997). In addition, the respondent has filed a motion to remand claiming that he is eligible for adjustment of status and also claiming that his request to reinstate his appeal before the Board was due to ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion is denied. The appeal is dismissed.
 
Initially, the Board will address the motion to remand. The respondent has two arguments contending that a remand is appropriate. First, he claims that he is now eligible for adjustment of status and should be given the opportunity to pursue that form of relief. He has indicated that the visa petition filed by his mother-in-law, Mrs. Angela Estrada, included him as well as his wife and that he is the beneficiary of an approved “family petition.” The evidence of record shows that his wife, Zoe M. Contreras, was the only beneficiary listed on Ms. Estrada’s Form I-797. We note that the respondent could not qualify as a beneficiary in any visa petition filed by his mother-in-law because family-sponsored immigrants include only spouses, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters of a citizen. See section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The petition for Zoe was approved and the respondent’s wife became a legal permanent resident of the United States in September 2004. However, there is no evidence of an approved visa petition, let alone the filing of such a petition, by the respondent’s wife with him listed as the beneficiary. See Hernandez v. Ashcroft, 345 F.3d 824 (9th Cir. 2003) (as the spouse of a lawful permanent resident, an alien is eligible for an immigrant visa under the second family preference category upon approval of the petition); 8 U.S.C. § 1153(a)(2)(A). The respondent has not forwarded an application for adjustment of status relative to himself in support of the motion to remand. Accordingly, the motion to remand to pursue adjustment of status is denied.
 
*2 Second, the respondent argues that his motion to remand should be granted because the reinstatement of his appeal before the Board amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel and that he has fulfilled all of the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Board finds that the respondent has not satisfied all the Lozada requirements in that he failed to notify his former attorney of the complaint filed against him and to give that individual an opportunity to respond to the allegations against him. Although the evidence shows that the respondent has filed a complaint against his former attorney with the State Bar of California, there is no evidence that he notified the attorney directly of the allegations. Even if the State Bar of California, in its investigation of the complaint, notifies the attorney of the allegations leveled against him, Lozada requires that the alien notify the attorney himself and give the attorney an opportunity to respond to the allegations against him.
 
Even if we were to find that the respondent substantially complied with the requirements in Lozada, the evidence does not support a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent’s prior attorney was making a strategic decision in advising him to make a motion to reinstate his appeal before the Board. Moreover, the respondent has admitted that he previously applied for temporary protected status (TPS) in April 1991 and his application was denied because of abandonment. See respondent’s Motion to Remand, dated November 3, 2004. Accordingly, the Board’s June 26, 2001, order administratively closing the proceedings before it to allow the respondent the opportunity to apply for TPS was actually affording the respondent a second chance to apply for TPS, when the record now shows that he had already applied for such relief and it had been denied. Accordingly, the motion to remand to pursue a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is denied as well.
 
Pursuant to the Board’s decision dated June 3, 2003, the respondent’s appeal of the March 12, 2001, Immigration Judge’s decision has been reinstated and is currently before us. The Immigration Judge denied relief under NACARA, finding that the respondent lacked good moral character based on substantial criminal activity. We agree that, based on the respondent’s prior criminal convictions, he lacks the requisite good moral character to be eligible for relief under NACARA. In 1992, the respondent was involved in an incident that resulted in a conviction for assault with a deadly weapon, gross bodily injury likely. He was found guilty, convicted, and sentenced to 90 days in jail and 24 months probation. Although this conviction ultimately was set aside and dismissed, the fact remains that he was found guilty and convicted of assault with a deadly weapon. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that expunged convictions can be used in assessing an alien’s good moral character because the facts underlying expunged convictions are relevant in the context of good moral character determinations. See United States. v. Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144, 1158-58 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Ramirez-Castro v. INS, 287 F.3d 1172 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
*3 We find that the Immigration Judge did not err in determining that the respondent did not have the good moral character required for relief under NACARA. Therefore, the respondent is statutorily ineligible for such relief and the application for NACARA was correctly denied.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: A78 107 181 - Dallas
December 27, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia for his failure to appear at the hearing on February 7, 2000. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent claims that he never received notice of the hearing. He also asserts that he established ineffective assistance of counsel for his failure to appear.
 
The record reflects that the notice of hearing was mailed to the respondent’s last known address. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has failed to demonstrate that he did not receive the notice of hearing that was mailed to his address. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record of proceedings that the respondent was represented by attorney Augustine Uke, since a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative Before the Immigration Court (Form EOIR-28) was never submitted to the Immigration Court.
 
In his motion to reopen filed on May 12, 2004, the respondent claimed ineffective assistance of counsel for his failure to appear. However, the respondent failed to file his motion to reopen within 180 days after issuance of the final order, as is required under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. See Matter of A-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998) and Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998) (a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day time limit under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act).1 Moreover, the respondent failed to comply with all of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). With his motion to reopen, the respondent submitted a State Bar of Texas Grievance Form. However, the respondent failed to submit an affidavit as required, nor did he submit evidence that his former counsel was informed of the allegations of ineffective assistance and given an opportunity to respond. Furthermore, there is no EOIR-28 form in the record of proceedings to indicate that Mr. Uke was representing the respondent before the Immigration Court. This is not a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel that may excuse strict compliance with the Lozada requirements. Consequently, the respondent has failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, and he has failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear.
 
*2 On appeal the respondent also asserts that he is eligible for adjustment of status based on his marriage to a United States citizen. An alien is not required to rescind his or her deportation order under section 242B of the Act if he or she is pursuing an application for new relief, and provided there is no evidence that the respondent received the required warnings under section 242B(e) of the Act. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998).2 Rather, the motion to reopen is only subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3).3 Under these standards, the respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s decision. He is accordingly precluded from having his motion considered under the general time limitations for a motion to reopen.4 Furthermore, the record reflects that the respondent received oral warnings of the consequences of failing to appear at a scheduled hearing. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

We note that Matter of A-A-, supra, and Matter of Lei, supra, arose in the context of deportation proceedings pursuant to section 242B of the Act. However, as section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act sets forth identical language to that contained in section 242B(c)(3), we can apply the reasoning set forth in Matter of A-A-, supra, and Matter of Lei, supra, by analogy.

2

We note that Matter of M-S-, supra, arose in the context of deportation proceedings and involved the interpretation of sections 242B(e)(1) and (5) of the Act, relating to the limitation on discretionary relief for failing to appear at a deportation hearing. However, as section 240(b)(7) of the Act sets forth a similar limitation on discretionary relief for failing to appear at a removal hearing, we can apply the reasoning set forth in Matter of M-S-, supra, by analogy.

3

Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3), a motion to reopen for the purpose of acting on an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.

4

We therefore decline to address the issue of prima facie eligibility for relief from removal, or whether the respondent would deserve a favorable exercise of discretion.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alan R. Diamante, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Motion to remand; cancellation of removal
 
The respondent, a male native and citizen of Mexico, appealed from an Immigration Judge’s decision dated August 4, 2003. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged, and denied his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). During the pendency of his appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel who represented him during the proceedings before the Immigration Judge. The respondent’s motion will be granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.1
 
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal because the respondent failed to complete his background and fingerprint checks in a timely fashion (I.J. at 4-5, 7). The Immigration Judge also noted lack of diligence on the part of the respondent’s counsel in filing his motion to withdraw as counsel with the Immigration Court (I.J. at 3). The Immigration Judge denied the motion to withdraw for having been filed too close to the hearing date, and for the attorney’s failure to adequately explain the reasons for his request to withdraw (I.J. at 4, 6-7).
 
The respondent contends that he fell victim to ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he alleges that his previous counsel failed to properly prepare for the hearing, and failed to timely file with the Immigration Court evidence which was requested by the Immigration Judge. He also contends that he cooperated fully and diligently with his attorney in gathering and submitting the necessary evidence. He indicated that he paid his former attorney a sum of money to complete the necessary work, and he relied on his attorney to complete and file with the Court the necessary documents. The respondent submitted a copy of an April 2, 2003, payment receipt from his prior attorney, indicating that this money was paid to prepare for the upcoming hearing. He also submitted a copy an April 2, 2003, receipt from the Sheriff’s Office, reflecting payment for a fingerprint card. The respondent indicated that he took the fingerprint card directly to his former attorney’s office. Moreover, the respondent submitted evidence reflecting that the California State Bar Court recently recommended that the attorney against whom the respondent claims ineffective assistance be disbarred for having rendered ineffective assistance to numerous of his immigration clients. The respondent’s former attorney was also recently suspended from practice before this Board.
 
*2 Overall, the record of proceedings reflects that the respondent’s application for cancellation removal was denied for failure to timely submit to the Immigration Court background and fingerprint checks. The evidence also indicates that such failure may have been the result of ineffective assistance of the respondent’s prior counsel. As such, the record reveals that the respondent suffered prejudice. In view of the foregoing, the following orders shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is granted and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mariusz Dragan, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On September 11, 2003, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision, in which the judge denied his motion to reopen removal proceedings, which were conducted in absentia.1 The respondent filed a late motion to reopen on August 2, 2004. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “‘DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), may be reminded only upon a motion to reopen, filed with the Immigration Judge within 180 days, which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act; Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722 (BIA 1999). The Board is precluded from considering such a challenge to an in absentia order in the first instance. See Matter of Guzman, supra. The Board has jurisdiction to consider an appeal, when a motion to reopen an in absentia order is denied by an Immigration Judge. Id. As stated, we considered, and denied, the respondent’s appeal from such a motion in this case. The respondent now seeks to have the Board reconsider its decision, based on a claim that 2 prior attorneys were ineffective.
 
The Immigration Judge, as affirmed by this Board, determined that the respondent’s motion to reopen filed with the judge was untimely, as it was not filed within 180 days of the in absentia decision. The Immigration Judge also concluded that the respondent had failed to show exceptional circumstances excusing his failure to appear at the removal hearing. The respondent argues in the pending motion that prior counsel erred in not filing the motion timely with the Immigration Judge, and that a second attorney provided ineffective assistance by not promptly bringing a complaint of ineffective assistance of counsel against the first attorney.
 
Even were we to agree that prior counsel erred by not filing a timely motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, and even were to consider this claim despite the lateness of the pending motion, we would find that the respondent has still failed to show exceptional circumstances for missing the February 27, 2001, removal hearing. The respondent asserts that he was not able to arrive on time for the hearing, because he was involved in an automobile accident. The lead respondent’s affidavit does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the respondent was unable to appear for the removal hearing, which was scheduled for 9 a.m. on February 27, 2001. See e.g. Matter of S-A-, 21 I&N Dec. 1050 (general assertion that heavy traffic precluded attendance at hearing does not provide reasonable cause for reopening). The respondent indicates that the accident caused damage to the vehicle, and rendered his automobile inoperable, but there is no suggestion that the respondent or his wife was injured. A receipt from an automobile collision company, which towed the car, states that the car was picked up at 8:30 a.m. The respondent fails to explain why, despite the fact that he was apparently uninjured, he could not thereafter either arrive at the immigration court by 9:00 a.m. or alert his counsel or the immigration court that he and his wife would be late. The respondent has not provided sufficient evidence to reopen the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent failed to establish that exceptional circumstances prevented his appearance at the February 27, 2001, removal hearing. The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lal, Hari S., Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Paul R. Foster,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 25, 2004. First, we reject the respondent’s claim that he is entitled to a remand because of the ineffective assistance of prior counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (requiring alien to set forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel; that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and that the alien indicate whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not). Although the respondent appears to meet the above-mentioned procedural requirements for asserting a so-called Lozada claim based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not shown how prior counsel’s failure to request a trial date or to adequately prepare his case caused any prejudice to him. This is true because the respondent has been convicted of an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (i.e., an alien convicted of a crime of violence). The respondent’s March 2002, conviction for committing lewd and lascivious acts upon a child under the age of 14 constitutes both sexual abuse of a minor (for which the respondent was not charged) and a crime of violence (which is charged in the Notice to Appear). See Exh. 2 (record of the respondent’s conviction under § 288(a) of the California Penal Code); see also U.S. v. Baron-Medina, 187 F.3d 1144 (9th Cir. 1999) (conviction under §288(a) of the California Penal Code is sexual abuse of a minor); U.S. v. Pereira-Salmeron, 337 F.3d 1148 (9th Cir. 2003) (conviction for sexual abuse of a minor is a crime of violence for purposes of U.S. Sentencing Guidelines). We note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s decision in U.S. v. Pereira-Salmeron, supra, has application beyond the sentencing guidelines, given the court’s overarching observation of the risk of force that is “inherent” when “an older person attempts to sexually touch a child under the age of fourteen.” U.S. v. Pereira-Salmeron, supra, at 1154 (citations omitted). Cf. Matter of Malta-Espinoza, 23 I&N Dec. 656 (BIA 2004). Because the respondent has been convicted of an aggravated felony as charged, and is consequently ineligible for the relief of cancellation of removal, voluntary departure, and a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, he has not shown any prejudice that may have resulted from the alleged ineffective assistance of prior counsel. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

*1 In a decision dated April 20, 204, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen in absentia proceedings. The respondent has appealed the decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent was ordered deported in absentia, based on his failure to appear for a scheduled hearing on March 19, 2004. On April 15, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent had notice of the hearing and that he failed to establish that exceptional circumstances caused his failure to appear. Subsequently, the respondent filed this appeal. On appeal, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his motion to reopen because he did demonstrate exceptional circumstances prevented him from appearing on time.
 
The respondent indicated in his motion to reopen that he appeared on time for his hearing before the Immigration Judge. He stated that his former attorney was not present so he waited outside the courtroom for his attorney to arrive. The respondent waited for his attorney for an hour past his scheduled appearance time, and was deported in absentia. He argued that he should not be penalized on account of his counsel’s dereliction of duty.
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because she did not receive proper notice of the hearing, or because she was in Federal or State custody and failed to appear through no fault of her own. Section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(5)(C). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
The Second Circuit has not addressed this issue directly. In Romero-Morales v. INS, 25 F.3d 125 (2d Cir. 1994), the court remanded for the Immigration Judge to consider the circumstances evidenced in the motion to change venue in connection with the motion to reopen an in absentia hearing. In another case, the First Circuit has found that the totality of the circumstances must be considered in deciding whether exceptional circumstances warrant the reopening of a decision in absentia to deport an alien who failed to appear. Herbert v. Ashcroft, 325 F.3d 68 (1st Cir. 2003). In that case the alien was 30 minutes late for his hearing at which his counsel did not appear, because counsel had another hearing before a federal magistrate. The Ninth Circuit has found that in the case of an alien who is merely late, it cannot be said that the alien “failed to appear,” and it is an abuse of discretion to refuse to reopen or to continue proceedings. Jerezano v. INS, 169 F.3d 613 (9th Cir. 1999). The Seventh Circuit has held that an alien showed exceptional circumstances where an alien waited for her interpreter, who was late. Nazarova v. INS, 171 F.3d 478, (7th Cir. 1999).
 
*2 We have considered the totality of circumstances surrounding the respondent’s case. We note that the respondent has not indicated that he was instructed by his attorney or anyone else to not enter the courtroom until the arrival of his counsel. He has also not filed a filed a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in accordance with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In addition, the respondent has no record of previous appearances in the Immigration Court. We find that, considering this record as a whole, he has not shown exceptional circumstances prevented him from appearing on time, and the respondent’s motion to reopen should be denied.
 
Accordingly, the Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed, and the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
AMENDED ORDER1
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen and reconsider our decision dated May 13, 2004. Applicable regulations provide that motions to reopen removal proceedings “shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.…” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2. The respondent must make a prima facie showing that he is eligible as a matter of law for the relief sought upon reopening. Matter of Rodriguez-Vera, 17 & N Dec.105 (BIA 1979). A motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration, be supported by pertinent case precedent and be predicated on a legal or factual defect in the most recent decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991).
 
The respondent’s instant motion is based on (1) our failure to grant his timely-filed motion for an extension in the briefing schedule on his appeal, and (2) a claim that ineffective assistance of counsel in the underlying criminal proceedings led to the imposition of a one-year sentence on a probation violation, and, hence, the respondent’s designation as an aggravated felon under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act. At bottom, we assume that the respondent claims that absent the 1-year sentence, he would not have been designated an aggravated felon, that the removal charge would not have been sustained, and that proceedings would have been terminated. As to the first basis for the motion to reopen, the respondent has not made a prima facie showing that he would likely have been granted relief if we had considered his brief on appeal. The respondent has not submitted a copy of the brief or indicated what additional information the appeal brief would have contained beyond the 6-page “Affirmation in Support of the Notice of Appeal” submitted with the appeal on February 11, 2004, which basically raised the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Notably, the respondent has not indicated that the brief would have included the necessary elements to make a cognizable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under rules previously articulated by this Board. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (B1A), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (requiring that the motion be supported by an affidavit by the alien setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel, including relevant representations; that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not). The respondent failed to meet these threshold requirements both in the underlying appeal and in his instant motion. At a minimum, we note that even at this point in these proceedings, the respondent has not submitted an affidavit swearing that his counsel in the criminal proceedings failed to inform him of the immigration consequences of his plea to one of the numerous alleged probation violations. Therefore, even if we were to reopen proceedings, the ineffective assistance of counsel claim would be deficient. In this regard, we reject the respondent’s reliance, in the motion to reopen, on his pending motion in New York state court to set aside his one-year criminal sentence. A pending motion to reduce an underlying criminal sentence falls far short of showing clear evidence of prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel during the removal proceedings below. See Ponce-Leiva v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 369, 377 (3d Cir. 2003).
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James D. Christo, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Laura A. Michalec
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before this Board on September 7, 2004, when we denied a motion to reconsider filed by the respondent. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen, based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, on October 4, 2004. A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed within 90 days of the administratively final order. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Board issued its administratively final decision dismissing the respondent’s appeal on June 4, 2004. The motion is untimely. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent claims that prior counsel was incompetent, because prior counsel failed to file a brief with this Board, which caused us to summarily dismiss his appeal. Even were the motions deadline tolled, the motion would be denied. As the DHS argues, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). As for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, Matter of Assaad, supra, and Matter of Lozada, supra, require that the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness, and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. See Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108, 110 (2d Cir. 1993). Here, there is no evidence that the respondent gave the attorney the opportunity to respond to the allegations of ineffectiveness. Matter of Lozada, supra. Consequently, there is no statement or affidavit from counsel, describing why she did not file a brief in support of the appeal. The motion asserts that “¿hºis former counsel has refused to respond to his requests for an explanation for her failure to timely file the brief …” but no proof is submitted that former counsel was notified of the charges against her. The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This matter was last before the Board on May 3, 2004, when we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision for failure to file an appellate brief where the respondent had indicated that he would do so in his Notice of Appeal. The respondent has timely filed a motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and seeking relief in the form of adjustment of status under section 1 of the Cuban Refugee Adjustment Act of November 2, 1966, Pub. L. No. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161, as amended (“Cuban Adjustment Act”). As the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the respondent’s motion, it is deemed unopposed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The motion will be granted and the record will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, and for the entry, of a new decision.
 
We find that the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements enunciated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). We further find that the respondent has demonstrated that he received ineffective assistance of counsel as his former attorney indicated that he would file an appeal brief in this matter but failed to file a brief with this Board, and the failure to file such brief prejudiced the respondent’s case.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Cuba, was last paroled into the United States. See Form I-213 Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien dated December 4, 2000. The respondent attempted to apply for adjustment of status before the Immigration Court, but he was informed by the Immigration Judge that submission of an adjusment application was unnecessary as the appropriate mechanism for adjustment under the Cuban Adjustment Act was termination, which required agreement from the DHS (Tr. at 25-26). See also Cuban Adjustment Act. However, termination does not require agreement from the DHS, whereas administrative closure does. See Matter of Gutierrez, 21 I&N Dec. 479 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 203 (BIA 1990). Moreover, this Board has held that an Immigration Judge has jurisdiction to adjudicate an application for adjustment of status under the Cuban Adjustment Act where an otherwise eligible arriving alien in removal proceedings is paroled into this country. See Matter of Artigas, 23 I&N Dec. 99 (BIA 2001). The respondent could have argued the holding in Matter of Artigas, supra, in an appeal brief, and we note that the respondent has submitted such a brief with his motion to reopen.
 
*2 The respondent has established prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status under the Cuban Adjustment Act as he was paroled into this country after January 1, 1959; he has been physically present in the United States for at least 1 year; and, he appears admissible and eligible for an immigrant visa.1 We conclude that these proceedings must be reopened based on the ineffective assistance of prior counsel, and the respondent will be allowed to apply for any form of relief for which he is eligible. As there do not appear from the current record to be negative factors that would militate against a favorable exercise of discretion, we will reopen this matter and the record will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision, and for the entry of a new decision.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and for the entry of a new decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Norma M. Molinar, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
W. Manning Evans
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. An Immigration Judge issued an order of removal against the respondent on February 5, 2003. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on June 3, 2004. The respondent was granted 30 days to voluntarily depart the United States. On August 17, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen, claiming to have new evidence concerning her request for cancellation of removal under section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d). We denied the motion to reopen on October 14, 2004. We found that the respondent was ineligible for cancellation of removal, as she remained in the United States beyond the voluntary departure period. See section 240B(d) of the Act. The respondent has filed a motion which, in essence, seeks to have the Board reconsider its October 14, 2004, decision, and claims that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is denied, as we correctly determined that she became statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal because she failed to voluntarily depart the United States, as ordered. See section 240B(d) of the Act. Although the respondent claims that former counsel provided ineffective assistance by not submitting a timely motion to reopen, in fact the motion to reopen was timely filed. The respondent does not demonstrate that former counsel is to blame for her failure to depart, as ordered. The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alexander H. Lubarsky, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Katrinka J. Blunt
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent asserts on appeal that her half hour delay in appearing before the Immigration Judge did not constitute a failure to appear. She also asserts that the Immigration Judge was without jurisdiction to order her removed to India because she had departed the United States between her first and second master hearing.
 
The Ninth Circuit, in which this case arises, has held that an Immigration Judge has discretion to determine that an alien’s late arrival for a hearing is excusable, and should not be characterized as a failure to appear. See Jerezano v. INS, 169 F.3d 613 (9th Cir. 1999). The Immigration Judge may exercise that discretion either on the day of the hearing, or while adjudicating a motion to reopen. If an Immigration Judge determines in the exercise of discretion that an alien’s lateness is excusable, the requirement to show “exceptional circumstances” for reopening is not required.
 
In this case, the Immigration Judge found that the alien’s late arrival was not excusable and did constitute a failure to appear. The Immigration Judge further concluded that there was no exceptional circumstance for that failure to appear. We do not find that the Immigration Judge erred in denying the motion in the exercise of discretion. The respondent’s decision to assume that the time listed on her notice of hearing was incorrect, rather than obtain clarification from the court, did not amount to exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear. Moreover, this was the second time the respondent had failed to appear for a removal proceeding.
 
We further find, to the extent the respondent claims ineffective assistance of counsel, that the respondent was not prejudiced by her attorney’s actions, as there appears to be little likelihood that reopening would change the result in this case. The respondent’s claim that the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction is without merit. Removal proceedings were commenced by the filing of the Notice to Appear with the Immigration Court on July 2, 2003. See 8 C.F.R. § 1239.1(a) (2004). This was also the point at which jurisdiction vested with the Immigration court. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.14(a) (2004). As the respondent did not depart the United States until August 20, 2003, the Immigration Judge had jurisdiction at the time of the respondent’s departure, and the September 25, 2003, in absentia order was proper. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Allan A. Samson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jayme Salinardi,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 14, 2003. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.
 
On October 18, 1995, the respondent was convicted of possessing an access card with intent to defraud. He was sentenced to three years in prison. The Immigration Judge found this to constitute an aggravated felony. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G)(1997). Consequently, he is ineligible for cancellation of removal. See Matter of C-V-T-, 22 I&N Dec. 7 (BIA 1998); 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229b(a)(3), 1229b(b)(1)(C)(1997). Because the respondent was found guilty following a jury trial, he is ineligible for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See INS v. St. Cyr, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (2001); Armendariz-Montoya v. Sonchik, 291 F.3d 1116 (9th Cir. 2002); 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c)(1995).
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that his former attorney committed ineffective assistance of counsel by withdrawing the respondent’s request for withholding of removal. We first note that the respondent has failed to show that he is even prima facie eligible for withholding of removal. The respondent failed to allege facts that, if true, would indicate a clear probability that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of a protected ground if he is returned to China. See INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407 (1984); 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3) (1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16 (2003).
 
In addition, we note that the respondent has failed to submit evidence that he has fulfilled the prerequisites for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent has failed to attach to his brief a sworn affidavit, signed by the respondent, setting out the alleged facts necessary to show a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. This affidavit should have included the allegations presented in respondent’s brief that the respondent’s prior counsel had erred in withdrawing the respondent’s request for withholding of removal.1 The sworn affidavit should have also included the contractual agreement with his former counsel concerning his withholding claim. The sworn affidavit should have also indicated that he has notified his former counsel of the allegation of ineffective assistance, enabling the former counsel to respond to the allegations. The sworn affidavit should have also indicated that a complaint has been filed against his former counsel with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. See Matter of Grijalva, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra. He also failed to show prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, supra. Because these prerequisites were not fulfilled, the respondent has failed to show a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

File: A91 973 031 - Los Angeles
December 9, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Nana Y. Boachie-Yiadom, Esquire
*1 In a decision dated September 18, 2003, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged and ordered his removal, should he fail to avail himself of voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge also determined that the respondent had failed to show eligibility for cancellation of removal. The respondent appealed the decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The respondent has failed to demonstrate that he qualifies for cancellation of removal, because he has failed to prove he has been a person of good moral character during the 10 years immediately preceding the date of his application, and he has failed show that he has not been convicted of certain offenses which would render him ineligible for that relief. See section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1129b(b)(1).
 
The respondent contends, on the appeal form, that he was allowed insufficient time to prepare and present his case, and that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to grant a continuance to permit his newly-retained counsel to prepare to represent him.1 A review of the record confirms, however, that the respondent had ample time to prepare his case and, on the date of the merits hearing, he had been granted a two-year continuance for the sole purpose of preparation of the cancellation application.
 
Proceedings in this case commenced in July 1998. At a hearing on August 7, 1998, the respondent stated that he wished to apply for cancellation, and an application form was provided. At a hearing on August 17, 1998, an Immigration Judge reported that the application had been submitted, and a merits hearing was scheduled. However, when the hearing convened on September 8, 1998, it was discovered that the respondent had been issued the wrong application form; he was provided with the correct form, and the hearing was rescheduled. Venue was changed to Los Angeles, and at a subsequent hearing, the respondent had retained local counsel, who explained that the cancellation application was not ready to file. The Immigration Judge granted a continuance, and the application was submitted at a hearing on February 11, 1999; at that time, a merits hearing was scheduled.
 
On July 3, 2000, counsel was not available, and the Immigration Judge continued proceedings. On October 10, 2001, the respondent’s hearing was delayed over a scheduling matter, and the Immigration Judge continued the case until September 18, 2003; when the hearing was convened on that date, the respondent reported that he had retained new counsel “yesterday”. The Immigration Judge granted the newly-retained counsel’s request to withdraw and proceeded with the pro se hearing.
 
*2 In view of the numerous and lengthy continuances which were granted in this case, we conclude that the Immigration Judge was well within his discretion to deny any further continuances. In particular, we note that a two-year continuance is an ample period of time to prepare for a merits hearing on a cancellation application, and for the respondent to have changed attorneys only the day before the rescheduled hearing suggests to us a lack of appreciation on his part for the nature of the proceedings and his responsibility to prove his eligibility and worthiness for the discretionary relief of cancellation.
 
In regard to the matter of yet another continuance, the respondent admitted to the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 51) that “I acknowledge before you that a great part of all this has been negligence for not getting in touch with an attorney. I think I don’t deserve an opportunity.”
 
The respondent has, on appeal, alleged that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s ineffective assistance of counsel, and he has accused former counsel of dishonesty. A complaint form against former counsel has allegedly been mailed to the State Bar of California.
 
Ineffective assistance of counsel is a denial of due process only if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case. Ramirez-Durazo v. INS, 794 F.2d 491 (9th Cir. 1986). A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be supported by: 1) an affidavit by the respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; 2) a showing that counsel in question has been informed of the allegations against him and given an opportunity to respond; and 3) a showing that a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, or if not, why not. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The respondent has not provided sufficient evidence to support a remand for further development of his charge of ineffective assistance. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002); Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). According to the transcript (Tr. at 42, 47-48), former counsel personally appeared before the Immigration Judge on the day of the hearing, September 18, 2003, and reported that he had been unable to communicate with the respondent because, among other reasons, the respondent’s telephone had been disconnected. Former counsel reported to the Immigration Judge that he had been trying to contact the respondent prior to the hearing but had been unsuccessful. Former counsel also stated to the Immigration Judge that his letters to the respondent had gone unanswered. It is apparent to us that the respondent’s cooperation with his then-counsel was less than he would have us believe. The respondent admitted (Tr. at 48) that, even had there been a communication problem, it was his responsibility to contact his counsel.
 
*3 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted voluntarily to depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails so to depart, he shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by DHS, he shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Meredith Brown, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (both respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening, cancellation of removal
 
The respondents appeal the Immigration Judge’s decision, dated July 28, 2003, denying the respondents’ applications for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The respondents’ appeal also seeks to have their case reopened and remanded to the Immigration Court for additional proceedings. The motion will be denied and the appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the male respondent’s (AXX XXX XXX) application for cancellation of removal because the respondent failed to establish that his removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. See section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act. The Immigration Judge pretermitted the female respondent’s (AXX XXX XXX) application for cancellation of removal because she failed to establish that she had been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years immediately preceding the date of such application. See section 240A(b)(1)(A) of the Act.
 
On appeal, the respondents assert that they essentially received ineffective assistance of counsel from an immigration consultant and they have new evidence in support of their application for cancellation of removal. Likewise, they assert that they were deprived of due process because they did not have counsel and the Immigration Judge did not assist the respondents sufficiently to allow them to establish their eligibility for cancellation of removal. Moreover, the male respondent claims that he established exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his United States citizen children. Since the respondents have requested that their case be reopened and they have submitted evidence in support of their claim, we will construe their appeal both as an appeal and as a motion to reopen.
 
A motion to reopen based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to taken and what representation counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and given an opportunity to respond; and, (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Furthermore, the respondent must show that he was prejudiced by his representative’s performance. See Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999); see also Mohsseni Behbahani v. INS, 796 F.2d 249 (9th Cir. 1986).
 
*2 In this case, there is no evidence that the respondents were ever represented by counsel prior to the filing of their appeal on August 26, 2003. A Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative before the Board of Immigration Appeals (Form EOIR-27) was not filed until after the Immigration Judge rendered a decision in the respondents’ immigration hearing. While the respondents attempt to equate assistance from an immigration consultant to ineffective assistance of counsel, their argument is not persuasive. The male respondent’s affidavit does not establish what exactly the agreement was with the immigration consultant and what exact representations were made. The respondent’s affidavit does not indicate if the consultant had been hired to obtain work authorization for the respondent or whether he had actually hired the consultant to pursue an application for cancellation of removal. The male respondent’s affidavit also does not indicate that the respondent received any guidance or advice from the immigration consultant during the course of the respondents’ removal proceeding. Rather, the male respondent blames the immigration consultant for his being placed in removal proceeding. As such, the male respondent’s affidavit fails to conform to the first prong of the Lozada requirements.
 
The respondents also provided a letter addressed to the immigration consultant stating that it will be filing a complaint against the consultant. However, the letter is deficient. It fails to advise the immigration consultant of any details regarding the complaint. Instead, it just indicates that the advice resulted in deportation proceedings. The letter was allegedly sent on May 17, 2004, and the respondents’ appeal brief was filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on May 19, 2004, only 2 days after the letter had been sent. As such, the immigration consultant was not afforded an opportunity to respond to the letter as required by the second prong of the Lozada requirements.
 
In an apparent attempt to comply with the third prong of the Lozada requirements, the respondents have submitted a document titled “County of Los Angeles Department of Consumer Affairs.” However, the document is in the Spanish language and is not accompanied by a certified English translation as required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.33. Thus, it cannot be considered as evidence demonstrating compliance with the third prong of the Lozada requirements. Furthermore, the Order of Permanent Injunction does not establish that the respondents filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. In fact, the document makes no reference whatsoever to the respondents. Accordingly, the respondents have failed to comply with the Lozada requirements. Consequently, the respondents’ motion does not warrant reopening based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*3 The respondents also submitted evidence along with their motion in support of their previously adjudicated application for cancellation of removal. A motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that the evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been presented at the former hearing. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).
 
In further support of their motion, the respondents have submitted a report card and two medical records. Academic records for the respondents’ children could have been presented at the former hearing. In fact, the Immigration Judge specifically advised the respondents that they could provide the school records for the children as early as July 30, 1998 (Tr. at 11). Therefore, the respondents had 4 years to submit evidence of the children’s school records. Moreover, a report card from a single grading period, absent any academic analysis, does not establish that the child has a learning disability, especially since the male respondent indicated that the children were doing well in school (Tr. at 46). Likewise, the two medical records reflect dates from 1999. Accordingly, the documents were previously available. In fact, the Immigration Judge continued the respondents’ case to allow them to provide additional medical records (Tr. at 24). Thus, the respondents have failed to establish that the evidence was not previously discoverable at their prior hearing and the motion will be denied. Id.
 
On appeal, the respondents essentially claim that they were denied due process because they were not represented by counsel and the Immigration Judge did not provide sufficient assistance to the respondents. The argument is without merit. The respondents were advised of their right to obtain counsel on several occasions and provided a list of legal services as required by 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(a) (Tr. at 2, 12, 55). In fact, the respondents’ case was continued over a period of 4 years during which time the respondents could have acquired the assistance of an attorney. The respondents were also provided an interpreter throughout the proceedings and indicated they understood the interpreter (Tr. at 1, 4, 16, 18, 24, 26, 30, 33, 36). In addition, the Immigration Judge repeatedly advised the male respondent of the evidence that he should submit to support his claim for cancellation of removal (Tr. at 11, 16, 21, 24, 27). In fact, the Immigration Judge continued the case at least six times, over a period of 4 years, to allow the male respondent an opportunity to submit evidence in support of his application. Not only did the Immigration Judge afford the respondent an opportunity to present evidence, the Immigration Judge specifically advised the respondent of the type of documentation needed to support his claim, such as school records, tax records, employment records, and medical records (Tr. at 10, 11, 16, 21, 24, 27). As a result, the respondents were not denied due process or prejudiced by the Immigration Judge.
 
*4 The Immigration Judge’s decision regarding the female respondent’s application for cancellation of removal is not erroneous. An applicant for cancellation of removal must establish that she has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years immediately preceding the date of such application. See section 240A(b)(1)(A) of the Act. In this case, the female respondent entered the United States on March 15, 1989 (Tr. at 8). She was personally served with the Notice to Appear (NTA) on March 26, 1998. The period of continuous physical presence ended on March 26, 1998, when the NTA was served. See section 240A(d)(1) of the Act. Thus, the female respondent’s period of continuous physical presence was for less than 10 years. Consequently, the female respondent is statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal.
 
The Immigration Judge denied the male respondent’s application for cancellation of removal because the male respondent failed to establish exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his United States citizen children. Cancellation of removal is available to an alien who has been physically present in the United States for at least 10 years, has been a person of good moral character, has not been convicted of a specified criminal offense, and has established that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien’s spouse parent or child, who is a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident. See section 240A(b) of the Act. The respondent shall have the burden of establishing that he is eligible for the benefit and that it should be granted in the exercise of discretion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d). An applicant for cancellation of removal must demonstrate that his removal would result in hardship to his qualifying relatives that is “substantially different from or beyond, that which would normally be expected from the deportation of an alien with close family members here.” See Matter of Andazola-Rivas, 23 I&N Dec. 319 (BIA 2002). Only hardship to qualifying relatives may be considered. See Matter of Monreal, 23 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2001). Factors to be considered are the ages, health, and circumstances such as serious health issues or compelling special needs in schools of the qualifying relatives. Id. Economic detriment alone is insufficient to support a finding of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. See Matter of Andazola-Rivas, supra, at 232. All hardship factors should be considered in the aggregate. See Matter of Monreal, supra, at 64.
 
Upon review of the record of proceedings and the Immigration Judge’s decision, we do not find that his decision is clearly erroneous. In this case, the male respondent testified that his children have no health problems and that they are doing well in school (Tr. at 46). He testified that the children are not in any special programs (Tr. at 46). All the children speak Spanish and Spanish is the language spoken primarily at home (Tr. at 46). The male respondent owns a taxi valued at approximately $2,000 but does not own any real property (Tr. at 46). The children have received Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), food stamps, and Medi-Cal (Tr. at 47-48). The respondent’s entire family resides in Mexico which consists of his parents and 13 siblings (Tr. at 51, 58, 59). He also testified that he might be able to get some assistance from his family in Mexico if he returns (Tr. at 51). Thus, the respondent failed to establish that his removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. See Matter of Andazola-Rivas, supra; see also Matter of Monreal, supra. Accordingly, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of cancellation of removal for both respondents.
 
*5 ORDER: The respondents’ motion to reopen and remand is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondents’ appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondents are permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the district director. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondents fail to so depart, the respondents shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondents fail to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the district director, the respondents shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN RE: SOFIA KORNEEVA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vladislav Sirota, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on July 22, 2004, when this Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen in absentia proceedings. On October 15, 2004, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance by her former counsel.1 The motion is denied.
 
In Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 135 (2d Cir.2000), the court held that “¿fºor an untimely claim to receive the benefit of equitable tolling … an alien must demonstrate not only that the alien’s constitutional right to due process has been violated by the conduct of counsel, but that the alien has exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll.” “In a situation where fraud or concealment of the existence of a claim prevents an individual from timely filing, equitable tolling of a statute of limitations is permitted until the fraud or concealment is, or should have been, discovered by a reasonable person in the situation.” Id., at 134.
 
In her motion for reopening, the respondent apparently alleges that her former counsel failed to adequately inform her of her hearing date, and that she received the notice late. However, the record reflects that in her motion to reconsider before the Immigration Judge, she alleged that she missed her hearing because she misread the hearing date, which conflicts with her current claim that she received her notice late. Moreover, the respondent has not stated what fraud or concealment prevented her from filing a timely motion. Our decision was issued on July 22, 2004, and she does not allege that she did not receive the decision. In our decision, we held that the respondent’s misreading of the notice did not constitute exceptional circumstances excusing her presence at the hearing. Consequently, at that time, the respondent should have become aware of a potential claim of ineffective assistance by former counsel. She has made no attempt to show that she exercised due diligence, and therefore we find she is not entitled to receive the benefit of equitable tolling.
 
Moreover, in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), we laid out the requirements that the respondent must meet in order to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. First, the motion should be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent attesting to the relevant facts. Second, before the allegation is presented to the Board, the former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond. Any subsequent response from counsel, or report of counsel’s failure or refusal to respond should be submitted with the motion. Finally, if it is asserted that prior counsel’s handling of the case involved a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities, the motion should reflect “whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation, and if not, why not.” Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997). Here, the respondent has failed to comply with the requirements set out in Lozada. Because we find support insufficient, we will not entertain this claim.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kanwal Singh, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Office of the Chief Counsel
San Diego
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on February 3, 2004. The pending motion was filed late, on August 27, 2004. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the pending motion, which will be granted.
 
In her motion to reopen, the respondent seeks to have proceedings reopened in order to pursue an application for adjustment of status, based on marriage to a United States citizen. See section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1245. In Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002), the Board held that a properly filed motion to reopen for adjustment of status based on a marriage entered into after the commencement of proceedings may be granted in the exercise of discretion, notwithstanding the pendency of a visa petition filed on the alien’s behalf, where: (1) the motion to reopen is timely filed; (2) the motion is not numerically barred by the regulations; (3) the motion is not barred by Matter of Shaar, 21 I&N Dec. 541 (BIA 1996), or on any other procedural grounds; (4) clear and convincing evidence is presented indicating a strong likelihood that the marriage is bona fide; and (5) the DHS does not oppose the motion or bases its opposition solely on Matter of Arthur, 20 I&N Dec. 475 (BIA 1992). Other than being filed untimely, and opposed by the DHS for that reason, the respondent’s motion appears to have satisfied these requirements. We note that the visa petition was approved on October 27, 2004.
 
The respondent argues that the motions deadline should be tolled, based on former counsel’s failure to inform her of the Board’s February 3, 2004, decision. The respondent has complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent submits an affidavit in which she states that former counsel did not tell her of our decision. Under the circumstances, we agree that the motions deadline should be excused. See Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1185-86 (9th Cir. 2004)(motions deadline subject to equitable tolling where lawyer’s deceit caused late filing, and respondent thereafter acted with due diligence).
 
*2 Accordingly, the record is remanded in order to afford the respondent an opportunity to present her application for adjustment of status to the Immigration Judge.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Richard F. Lemus, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent’s motion to reopen has been filed out of time. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal without opinion on January 26, 2004. The respondent has filed an untimely motion on August 31, 2004. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent claims that former counsel failed to notify him of the Board’s decision so that he could either file a timely motion to reopen, or voluntarily depart under our January 26, 2004, order. However, the respondent has failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). As for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, those cases require, among other things, that the respondent give the attorney the opportunity to respond to the allegations of ineffectiveness. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 598-99 (9th Cir. 2004)(notification to counsel is “required” for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim). Here, former counsel was not given an opportunity to respond to the claim that he failed to notify the respondent of our January 26, 2004, decision.
 
Even were the motions deadline tolled, it would be denied. The respondent claims that former counsel was ineffective, because his error resulted in the respondent not filing a timely application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1229b(b)(1). Yet the respondent is not currently eligible for such relief, based on the information in the pending motion and proposed application for relief. The respondent claims that his removal would result in hardship to his United States citizen “child”. See section 240A(b)(1)(D) (applicant for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) must show hardship to qualifying relative). Yet a birth certificate for the respondent’s son indicates that he was born on February 10, 1982, and he is therefore 22 years old. To be considered a “child” for purposes of cancellation of removal, the relative must be under 21 years old. See section 101(b) of the Act. The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Martin Resendez Guajardo, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. A final order of removal was entered by an Immigration Judge on October 6, 1998, in which the respondent was found to be ineligible for cancellation of removal. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal summarily on April 9, 2002. Over 2 years later, on September 28, 2004, the respondent has filed a motion to reopen. A motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed not later than 90 days after the date of that decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The pending motion to reopen was filed very late. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent’s former counsel, Miguel Gadda, has been disbarred from practicing before the Board, as well as in California and in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 857 (9th Cir. 2004)(in that case, where a timely motion to reopen was found, the Ninth Circuit ordered the Board to reconsider its decision concerning whether the respondent was prejudiced by Gadda’s actions). Here, the respondent asserts that prior counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel before the Immigration Judge. She further argues that we should have informed her prior to our April 9, 2002, decision that Gadda had been suspended from practice before the Board. Yet there is no basis for abrogating the motions deadline here. An individual seeking to rely upon “equitable tolling” of a filing deadline must show that she has acted with due diligence. See Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir. 2004); Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir.2003). The respondent makes no such showing. We sent our April 9, 2002, directly to the respondent at her address. There is no affidavit provided from the respondent, and no argument made in the motion, as to why the respondent waited 2 years to seek new counsel and file the pending motion. The motion to reopen is, therefore, denied.

James Todd Bennett, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jo Ellen Ardinger
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
On March 17, 2004, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent removed from the United States in absentia, because he failed to appear for his hearing. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on August 5, 2004, but that request was denied on August 13, 2004. The respondent, a 47-year-old native and citizen of Nicaragua, has appealed from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The record reflects that the respondent’s original counsel appeared at a hearing on March 10, 2004, but the respondent did not appear, allegedly because he had car trouble. He had left a message on counsel’s telephone to that effect. Counsel was notified in person that the removal hearing was rescheduled for March 17, 2004. Counsel appeared on that date and informed the court he was unable to contact the respondent. He told the Immigration Judge that he had attempted to contact the respondent repeatedly both by mail and by telephone. Consequently, the respondent was unaware of the hearing. The Immigration Judge granted a motion to withdraw as attorney of record and ordered the respondent removed. The new attorney on the motion stated that previous counsel did not inform the respondent of the hearing and asked that the respondent be given an opportunity to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility and cancellation of removal.
 
As correctly indicated in the Immigration Judge’s decision, a Notice of Hearing given to an alien’s attorney of record is proper notice. See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5. Actual notice to an alien is not required. Farhoud v. INS, 122 F.3d 794 (9th Cir. 1997). We, therefore, find that the respondent was properly notified of the hearing. The respondent has an obligation to stay in touch with the attorney in order to stay informed of his immigration responsibilities. If he had contacted his attorney at any time after the first missed hearing, he could have been told the hearing was rescheduled.1
 
Although the respondent has raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, claiming that counsel failed to notify him of the hearing, the respondent has fallen far short of establishing “exceptional circumstances” for his failure to appear at the hearing. See section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252b(c)(3)(A). The respondent speculates that the first counsel may have sent the letter to the wrong address and telephoned the wrong number. The respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for filing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as enunciated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (procedural requirement established in Matter of Lozada, supra, need not be rigidly enforced); see also Ontiveros-Lopez v. INS, 213 F.3d 1121 (9 th Cir. 2000) The respondent has made no attempt to inform his former attorney of the accusation of ineffective assistance, and, therefore, we are not given the benefit of the attorney’s explanation of the circumstances which led to the in absentia hearing. The respondent has also offered no explanation for their failure to report this incident to the California bar. We, therefore, are unable to find that “exceptional circumstances” exist which justify the respondent’s failure to appear for his hearing.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order is entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

He also alleges he did not receive the Immigration Judge’s in absentia removal decision; however, this contention would support only the argument that the motion should not be dismissed as untimely.

Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
This case was last before us on July 16, 2004. In that decision we summarily affirmed the decision of an Immigration Judge dated November 18, 2002, in which the respondent was found to have abandoned his claims for relief due to a failure to comply with a deadline to have his fingerprints taken and to submit an application for relief. See Tr. at 54-56. On August 23, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and remand based on ineffective assistance of counsel. For the following reasons, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
The respondent alleges that this case should be remanded based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent concedes he has not complied with the guidelines set forth in Matter of Lozada, 20 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent has failed to file an affidavit detailing the relationship between himself and counsel. Id. at 639. He has also failed to file a complaint with the appropriate state bar. Id. In the absence of detailed information regarding the relationship between the respondent and counsel, it is impossible for us to properly evaluate the specific substance of the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim. The respondent has submitted a letter from counsel admitting blame for the failure to timely file an application. However, in the absence of a state bar complaint, and in the absence of an affidavit from the respondent, we find that the respondent has not met the procedural or substantive requirements for reopening of proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel. This case can be distinguished from Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934 (9th Cir. 2003), a case on which the respondent relies for the proposition that he does not have to meet the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. The circumstances described in Lo v. Ashcroft, supra, indicated that the respondents, who had been issued an in absentia order of removal, had done all they reasonably could to have their cases heard promptly. In the present case, the circumstances leading to the finding that the respondent had abandoned his application for relief include indications that the respondent himself had not done all he reasonably could do to file his application on time.
 
*2 Additionally, the respondent has not established that he was prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent testified that he was told by counsel that he had to submit fingerprints in connection with his application for relief and that he did not do so (Tr. at 55). The respondent was convicted of a serious crime and, in a case where the respondent’s ability to demonstrate rehabilitation and good moral character was a potentially dispositive issue, the failure to comply with the fingerprinting requirement was clearly a failure to meet a reasonable and significant deadline. This failure, which is not attributable to counsel, constituted a reasonable basis for a finding that the respondent had abandoned his application for relief. See generally Matter of Jean, 17 I&N Dec. 100 (BIA 1979); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) (if an application or document is not filed within the time set by the Immigration Judge, the opportunity to file that application or document shall be deemed waived).
 
Finally, we note that information regarding respondent’s counsel’s apology for not filing the required documents on time was a matter of record at the time of the Immigration Judge’s decision (Tr. at 55). Counsel’s letter taking responsibility adds little to the facts already present in the record and, without more, is not the type of information that forms a basis for reopening. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 (a motion to reopen should state facts not previously available); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
 
In light of the foregoing, the following order will be entered.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Plummer, Lilly A., Esq.
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated May 03, 2004. The respondent bases his motion to reopen on two grounds: first, he seeks reopening to present new evidence in support of his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; and, second, he asserts that he was denied a fair hearing due to the ineffective assistance of his prior counsel, Marcela Garcia Moreno. The respondent’s motion is denied. While the respondent now submits additional documentation to bolster his cancellation application, he has failed to demonstrate that these documents were unavailable at the time of his removal hearing. 8 C.F.R. §1003.2(c). These documents do not contain any new or previously unavailable or undiscoverable information. The medical condition of the respondent’s twin daughters was considered by the Immigration Judge (I.J. 13-14). Regarding the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, he has not complied with the procedural steps set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). There is no evidence that he filed a bar complaint against Ms. Moreno. Moreover, he has failed to prove any prejudice resulting from his former counsel’s performance. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen our decision dated October 24, 2002, and re-issue it. We note at the outset that this is not a motion involving a court order to re-issue our decision. Nor is this a motion claiming that there was an administrative error on our part which caused a defect in the service of our October 24, 2002, decision. The motion is untimely. The respondent contends that it is untimely because she had ineffective assistance of counsel from her last attorney, Mr. Patrick Salley. She alleges that Mr. Salley failed to inform her when we dismissed her appeal. As a result, she was unable to seek a timely petition for review in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In support of reopening, the respondent submits, among other things, the affidavit of family members and a copy of her grievance to the State of Michigan Attorney Grievance Commission. Her complaint was filed on September 29, 2004. We find that the respondent’s evidence does not meet the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) for her to prevail in a due process challenge. Moreover, prejudice has not been shown. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Accordingly, the motion is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Lourdes Martinez-Esquivel, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law (all respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on June 16, 2004, when we denied the respondents’ motion requesting reconsideration of our January 23, 2004, decision, in which we dismissed their appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision due to untimeliness. The respondents seek to appeal the Immigration Judge’s September 11, 2003, decision again as they filed a second Notice of Appeal on June 24, 2004. This appeal is also untimely as it was filed well after the 30-day filing deadline following the Immigration Judge’s decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.53 (2004). The respondents now move to reopen the proceedings due to ineffective assistance of counsel and to stay the orders of deportation. The respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
We note at the onset that we denied the respondents’ motion to reconsider our dismissal of their untimely appeal, and as a result, we still lack jurisdiction over this matter and the Immigration Judge’s decision therefore remains final (Board’s January 23, 2004, decision). Even considering the respondents’ appeal as a motion to reopen, they are barred by the time limitations on such motions. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (stating that a 90-day filing deadline following the date of a final administrative decision applies to motions to reopen). Moreover, the subject-matter of the motion does not place it within any of the regulatory exceptions to that limitations period. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3).
 
Even assuming we were to grant reopening on the basis of equitable tolling, we do not find that the respondents have presented prima facie evidence that their failure to timely file was due to ineffective assistance of counsel. Although respondents appear to have satisfied some of the procedural requirements for such a claim, they have failed to establish that they were prejudiced by their former attorney’s actions. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Assadd, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Rivera-Claros, 21 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 1996). The respondents allege that their former counsel failed to file a timely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s September 11, 2003, decision, and also complain of insufficient preparation on behalf of former counsel’s law office (Respondents’ Motion at 2). The respondents filed their appeal on November 21, 2003, over 1 month after the appeal filing deadline. We note, however, that the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has held that “prejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings,” and that “¿wºhere counsel fails to file any appeals brief in the context of an immigration proceeding, effectively depriving an alien of an appellate proceeding entirely, there is a rebuttable presumption of prejudice.” See Dakane v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 371 F.3d 771, 775 (11th Cir. 2004) (citing Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, 232 F.3d 1042, 1045 (9th Cir.2000))). While counsel’s untimely appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision may create a presumption of prejudice, we find that any such presumption is rebutted by the respondents’ inability to demonstrate how the failure to file a timely appeal would have altered the Immigration Judge’s decision.1 See id. at 775-776.
 
*2 Moreover, even if we were to find that the respondents have demonstrated prejudice, courts have consistently held that a party seeking equitable tolling must act with due diligence throughout the proceeding. See generally Justice v. United States, 6 F.3d 1474 (11th Cir. 1993). After we rejected the respondents’ untimely appeal on January 23, 2004, which is their primary point of discontent, the respondents submitted the aforementioned motion to reconsider our dismissal on February 19, 2004. However, they apparently waited to file a complaint with the Florida Bar regarding their former counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance until May 10, 2004 (Respondents’ Motion at 1). Thus, even after we rejected the Respondents’ appeal, their former counsel continued his representation at their request for over 3 months. The respondents also never informed the Board that they sought withdrawal of their former counsel. Therefore, even assuming that all of Lozada’s requirements, supra, are satisfied, we are unable to find that the respondents acted with due diligence after learning of the alleged ineffective assistance of their former attorney.2 See, e.g., Justice v. United States supra, at 1483 (stating that equitable tolling is not warranted where a plaintiff failed to act with due diligence).
 
We also note that the respondents have not shown why the execution of their deportation orders should be stayed and accordingly deny their motion for a stay of deportation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(f). We further find that the new evidence they seek to have considered would not change the result of the Immigration Judge’s decision, and therefore reopening is not warranted. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Finally, we find that the circumstances presented in the motion are not “exceptional” as to justify a sua sponte reopening of the matter. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, for all the reasons discussed, the respondents’ motion to reopen is denied.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ motion to reopen is denied.

We note that after the Immigration Judge issued his oral decision on September 11, 2003, he denied respondents’ motion for reconsideration on November 3, 2003, stating that the decision rendered was clear and complete and that the respondents failed to submit evidence compelling reconsideration of their case.

We also note that the present motion to reopen was already denied by the Immigration Judge on June 25, 2004, stating that the respondents failed to show actual prejudice in their claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
H. Raymond Fasano, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Virna Wright,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reconsider
 
*1 In an order entered on July 9, 2004, we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings, following our order of April 23, 2004, in which we dismissed her appeal. The respondent has filed a motion to reconsider our most recent order. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). A motion to reconsider must assert that, at the time of our previous decision, an error was made. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The very nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard. Id.
 
The respondent has presented no persuasive evidence or argument that we committed error of law or fact in denying her motion to reopen. The country information that the respondent submitted with her motion to reopen on May 24, 2004, clearly indicated that the subject of religion continues to be an emotionally charged issue in Indonesia, but it did not demonstrate significantly changed country conditions. The background information revealed that, as of 1990, approximately 10% of the approximately 230 million Indonesians were Catholics or Protestants, and that Christians held several high posts in the government. Episodic violence between Muslims and non-Muslims continued to be a concern, but the evidence did not establish that the respondent’s alleged fear of persecution is reasonable. Given the evidence of record, we do not conclude that we overlooked or mis-characterized the state of affairs in Indonesia, in light of the respondent’s claimed experiences and fears.
 
The respondent also alleges that we erred in concluding that she had argued that ineffective assistance of former counsel prejudiced her, in regard to her failing to understand the consequences of not availing herself of the grant of voluntary departure. However, at page 10 of her motion to reopen, at section “d”, the respondent, through counsel, stated that she should be given an opportunity to withdraw her previous attorney’s application for voluntary departure. At paragraph 29, the respondent stated that “her previous attorney never explained to her the meaning of voluntary departure.” Given those statements in the respondent’s own motion, we do not find it beyond the pale to have concluded that she was referring to ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
In any event, the respondent now characterizes her argument regarding voluntary departure as one of a due process violation, rather than ineffective assistance of counsel. In essence, the respondent claims that we erred in failing to conclude that the consequences of failing voluntarily. to depart were not explained to her prior to the Immigration Judge’s decision. It must be remembered that the respondent was represented by competent counsel at the proceedings, and that counsel requested voluntary departure on her behalf. It is reasonable to assume that competent counsel, in the performance of his duties, explained the aspects of voluntary departure to the respondent. If the respondent had any doubts about the nature of the privilege of voluntary departure, they were certainly dispelled prior to the conclusion of the hearing. The Immigration Judge explained voluntary departure to the respondent (Tr. at 67-68), and she responded that she understood the matter.

Lynn K. Hollander
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Continuance, remand
 
The respondent timely appeals the Immigration Judge’s June 13, 2003, decision denying the respondent’s request for a continuance and ordering him removed. The respondent further submits a motion to remand. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed and the motion denied.
 
The respondent’s motion requests a remand to provide the respondent the opportunity to adjust his status. Where, as here, a motion to remand is in the nature of a motion to reopen, the motion must comply with the substantive requirements of the latter motion. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471 (BIA 1992). The governing regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) require that a motion to reopen “shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.” The regulations further specify that “¿aº motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.” Id.
 
The respondent has not complied with those requirements. The respondent merely provides a copy of his I-130 (Immigrant Petition for Relative) with the motion. That is not evidence that the respondent is admissible to the United States, i.e., that none of the qualitative grounds of inadmissibility apply in his case. That showing requires, at a minimum, a properly executed adjustment application. Inasmuch as the respondent has failed to provide an adjustment application, we will deny the respondent’s motion to remand.
 
The respondent claims on appeal that he received ineffective assistance of counsel throughout his proceedings before the Immigration Judge. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998).
 
*2 Upon review of the respondent’s brief and the evidence submitted on appeal, we find that the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim fails for numerous reasons as it neglects to abide by any of the requirements provided in Matter of Lozada, supra. Accordingly, we will not remand the record to the Immigration Court to remedy the alleged ineffective assistance.
 
Finally, we note that the respondent argues on appeal that the removal proceedings were unconstitutional in that they usurped the Congressional power to legislate. The Board is not empowered, however, to rule on the constitutionality of the statutes and regulations that we administer. Matter of Valdovinos, 18 I&N Dec. 343 (BIA 1982).
 
Based on the foregoing, we will dismiss the respondent’s appeal and deny the motion to remand.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

Tracy Nguyen,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). On appeal, the respondent renews a request for relief through cancellation of removal. We agree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that the equities presented fall well short of the strenuous standard we set forth in Matter of Andazola, 23 I&N Dec. 319 (BIA 2002) and Matter of Monreal, 23 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2001)(qualifying relative must experience hardship that is “‘substantially’ beyond the ordinary hardship that would be expected when a close family member leaves this country” in order to meet the “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” standard). In addition, the respondent’s equities are also sufficiently distinct from those presented in Matter of Recinas, 23 I&N Dec. 467 (BIA 2002) that we find them insufficient to establish exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.
 
In conjunction with the appeal, the respondent has filed a motion to remand. The motion is denied. A motion will not be granted unless there is a reasonable likelihood of success upon reopening. See generally Matter of Beckford, 22 I&N Dec. 1216, 1218 (BIA 2000) citing Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996); INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992) (indicating that motions to reopen in immigration proceedings are disfavored). Since we find that the qualifying relatives would not suffer the requisite hardship upon the respondent’s removal, the case would not appear to have a likelihood of success if proceedings were remanded to the Immigration Judge.
 
To the extent that the respondent alleges previously receiving inadequate legal representation, the respondent failed to comply with the requirements we detailed in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (laying out the requirements that an alien must meet in order to support a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). While we acknowledge that the record of proceedings contains a refund request filed with the California Department of Consumer Affairs, there is no indication that the respondent filed a complaint regarding the former representative with the appropriate legal disciplinary authorities. Id. at 639. We therefore find that the respondent has failed to establish that reopening would be warranted for ineffective assistance of the prior representative. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
 
*2 FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the alien fails to so depart, the alien shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael Meltzer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Tracy Nguyen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)º - Entered without inspection
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
This matter was last before the Board on December 19, 2002, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen and request for administrative closure. On April 27, 2004, the respondent filed the instant motion to reconsider pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). The motion will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent’s motion is untimely. A motion to reconsider must be filed within 30 days after the mailing of the Board decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). Here, the respondent did not file his motion until 16 months after the Board issued its decision. The respondent asserts in a supplemental filing submitted to the Board on October 14, 2004, that his motion is untimely because neither he nor his former attorney received the Board’s prior decision, and he was therefore unaware that his motion to reopen had been denied. The respondent asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled. The respondent has submitted new evidence in support of his claim of ineffective assistance. We will therefore treat his motion as one to reopen rather than one to reconsider. Compare 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b) (stating that a motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision, supported by pertinent authority) with 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) (stating that “a motion to reopen proceedings shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material”).
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the circuit in which this case arises, has ruled that filing deadlines for motions before the Board may be equitably tolled where a respondent has been prevented from filing by deception, fraud, or error, as long as he acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003); Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1224 (9th Cir. 2002). In order to receive the benefit of equitable tolling, a respondent who alleges ineffective assistance must first comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The motion should be supported by an affidavit attesting to the relevant facts, including a statement setting forth the details of the agreement that was entered into with former counsel. See id. at 639. The respondent should also notify former counsel of the allegations of ineffective assistance so that he or she may respond, and, if the case involved a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities on the part of former counsel, the respondent should file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. Id. In this case, the motion is supported by an affidavit from the respondent, a copy of his contract of representation with former counsel, a complaint form for the State Bar of California dated October 10, 2004, and a copy of a letter to the respondent’s former counsel informing him of the complaint (Respondent’s Exhs. A-C). We find that the respondent has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, supra. See Rodriguez-Lariz, supra, at 1226-27 (stating that the factors are not rigidly applied).
 
*2 The respondent’s affidavit states that neither he, nor his former counsel, received a copy of the Board’s decision regarding his original motion to reopen (Respondent’s Exh. A). The record reflects that the Board’s decision was sent directly to the respondent at his last known address because his former attorney failed to file a Form EOIR-27, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative, despite being notified by the Board on August 26, 2002, that he needed to do so. The notice, which was also mailed to the respondent’s last known address, provides: “Unless a Form EOIR-27 is received from your representative, you will be considered pro se (representing yourself) before the Board and all future notices, including the Board’s decision, will be sent directly to you at your address above and not to your representative.” The respondent’s affidavit states that he moved in January 1998 and that his former counsel was aware of his new address and sent correspondence there; however, the respondent speculates that his former attorney “never notified ¿ the Boardº of the change of address.” The respondent states that he and his wife called former counsel periodically regarding the status of his case, and they were always told that it was pending, even “¿aºs late as April 13, 2004.” The respondent says that his wife sent a letter to the attorney in May 2004 informing him that she and the respondent were dissatisfied with his service and planned to file a complaint with the California Bar Association (Respondent’s Exh. C, undated). The attorney apparently did not respond to the letter.
 
We do not find that the respondent acted with due diligence regarding his case and conclude that he does not qualify for equitable tolling. First, we note that it is the alien’s responsibility to ensure that his address of record is current. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(e) (requiring that within 5 working days of any change of address, an alien must provide notice to the Board via Form EOIR-33). We further note that although the respondent filed his original motion to reconsider in April 2004, around the time he allegedly discovered his former attorney’s wrongdoing, he did not assert his claim of ineffective assistance until 6 months later, and did not file a complaint with the California State Bar until October 2004. The respondent has provided no explanation for these delays, except that he is a long-distance trucker and spends much of his time away from home.
 
Finally, even assuming the respondent received ineffective assistance, he has not shown that his case was prejudiced by the errors of former counsel. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra, at 901-02. Even if the respondent’s motion to reconsider had been timely, it did not identify errors of fact or law in our previous decision. Thus, assuming that he had received our decision in a timely fashion and filed his motion to reconsider immediately thereafter, the respondent’s motion still would have been denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Michael Meltzer, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Thomas L. Day
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the September 9, 2003, decision of the Immigration Judge, denying waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c), and we also adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge dated October 2, 2003, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The Immigration Judge correctly denied waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(c) due to the seriousness of the aggravated felony offense for which the respondent pled guilty and was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. Moreover, the report provided by the evaluator, Richard King, Ed. D., notes that, although the respondent seemed to have benefitted from sex offender intervention, he “must continue to be restricted with his contact with female teenagers.” We do not find that the evidence shows adequate rehabilitation if the respondent still needs to be restricted from contact with young females. Further, the Immigration Judge correctly denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, finding that the basis for reopening cited by the respondent primarily related to testimonial issues and that the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel would not change the outcome and there is no indication of any prejudice based on the representation the respondent received. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The appeal is untimely. A Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26) must be filed within 30 calendar days of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of a written decision unless the last day falls on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the appeal must be received no later than the next working day. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.38(b), (c). In the instant case, the Immigration Judge’s decision was rendered orally on August 20, 2004. The appeal was accordingly due on or before September 20, 2004. The record reflects, however, that the Notice of Appeal was filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals on October 4, 2004. We find that the appeal is untimely. In conjunction with the appeal, the respondent filed a Motion for Late Filing of Brief in which the respondent raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as the reason for the untimeliness of her appeal. Counsel’s September 24, 2004, letter, which returned the respondent’s partial payment of $500.00 for failing to pay the filing fee for an appeal in full and copies of payment receipts made to counsel were provided as evidence to support this claim. However, the Board need not address this issue considering the respondent has failed to comply with the requirements as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Therefore, we do not find this factor to be an adequate reason to accept this appeal by certification. The Immigration Judge’s decision is therefore now final, and the record is returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.
 
We note that because we have dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, either party wishing to file a motion in this case should follow the following guidelines: If you wish to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely, you must file your motion with the Board. However, if you are challenging any other finding or seek to reopen your case, you must file your motion with the Immigration Court. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974); Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998). You should also keep in mind that there are strict time and number limits on motions to reconsider and motions to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(2), 1003.23(b)(1); Matter of J- J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Celeste S. Castro, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Nadia Fleischer,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 18, 2004, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. In his motion, the respondent sought reopening claiming ineffective assistance of former counsel. Specifically, the respondent alleged that his former counsel failed to file an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s July 31, 2003, decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation under 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The appeal is dismissed.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 3367 (BIA 1998).
 
In addition, we note that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that an alien need not fulfill all the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel when the record reflects a clear and obvious case of such. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that attorney’s failure to timely file a suspension of deportation application was negligence). See also Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 Based on the actions of the respondent’s former counsel and the respondent’s compliance with Lozada, we find that he established ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the respondent did not provide any evidence with the motion which indicates that he would have prevailed with his appeal, had one been filed. Based upon this lack of proof, we are unable to find that the respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements for proving that he was prejudiced by his former attorney in these proceedings. Consequently, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
John C. Nelson, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (all respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Remand; cancellation of removal
 
On April 7, 2003, an Immigration Judge found that the respondents had abandoned their applications for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1), but granted their request for voluntary departure. The respondents have appealed from this decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondents are a family from Mexico. On appeal, they contend that they were the victims of ineffective assistance of counsel during their hearing before the Immigration Judge, and they therefore ask that their cases be remanded to the Immigration Judge to allow them to apply for cancellation of removal.
 
To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must show that his or her counsel’s performance was ineffective, and he or she must meet the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The alien also must establish that he or she was prejudiced by his or her attorney’s actions. See Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1226 (9th Cir. 2002) (stating that ineffective assistance of counsel is a due process violation and that due process challenges to deportation proceedings require a showing of prejudice to succeed) (citations omitted). In this case, the respondents have not met the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, and they also have not shown that they were prejudiced by their attorney’s conduct.1
 
According to Matter of Lozada, supra, an alien must (1) submit an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the alien in this regard, (2) notify counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned of the allegations leveled against him or her and give him or her the opportunity to respond, and (3) show whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities. In this case, the respondents have not presented any evidence to show that they have informed their former counsel of the charges against him and given him the chance to respond to these charges.
 
*2 The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the circuit in which this case arises, has held that “the Lozada requirements are generally reasonable, and under ordinary circumstances the Board does not abuse its discretion when it denies a motion to remand or reopen based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel where the petitioner fails to meet the requirements of Lozada.” See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted). Nevertheless, the Ninth Circuit has stated that the Lozada requirements are not sacrosanct. Id. Specifically, the court has found that, when the facts are plain on the face of the administrative record, the requirements of Lozada “are not dispositive.” Id. In reaching this conclusion, the court explained that “Lozada is intended to ensure both that an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one.” Id. at 526.
 
The record in this case suggests that the respondents may bear some of the responsibility for the failure to meet the deadline for filing their applications for cancellation of removal (Tr. at 13). And the adult male respondent’s brief statement regarding his former counsel’s inaction does not clarify this point. Accordingly, notice to the respondents’ former counsel is necessary in this case to establish that their former attorney has had the opportunity to present his version of the facts and to demonstrate that the respondents’ complaint is legitimate and substantial. Cf. Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, supra (finding substantial compliance when record on its face showed ineffective assistance of counsel). The respondents’ failure to submit evidence that they provided this notice therefore prevents us from concluding that they are entitled to a remand to seek cancellation of removal.
 
In addition, the respondents have not shown that they were prejudiced by the actions of their former attorney. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that alien is prejudiced if attorney’s conduct may have affected the outcome of the proceeding). The adult female and the young female respondent have not shown that they meet the continuous physical presence requirement of section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, and the adult male respondent has not submitted evidence suggesting that his removal will impose exceptional and extremely unusual hardship on his United States citizen son.
 
The adult female and the young female respondent apparently entered the United States on November 25, 1992, but they were served with the Notice to Appear on May 22, 2001. They therefore did not obtain 10 years’ continuous physical presence before their period of continuous physical presence ended. See section 240A(d)(1) of the Act.
 
*3 The adult male respondent does appear to have accrued 10 years’ continuous physical presence before he was placed in proceedings. He, however, has not submitted evidence to suggest that his removal would impose any hardship beyond the normal hardships imposed by removal on his United States citizen son. See Iturribarria v. INS, supra (finding that alien had not established prejudice when alien had not offered evidence to suggest that he met the extreme hardship requirement for suspension of deportation). Given these facts, we cannot conclude that the respondents are entitled to a remand to apply for cancellation of removal, and we dismiss their appeal.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondents are permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security. See section 240B(b) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondents fail to so depart, the respondents shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondents fail to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the Department of Homeland Security, the respondents shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

The respondents in this case have raised their ineffectiveness of counsel claim on appeal rather than in a motion to reopen. The respondents, however, are still seeking remand, which requires the reopening of their proceedings, and they are still required to meet the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, or to show substantial compliance. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (indicating that strict adherence to the Lozada requirements is not always required).

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A) (i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal
 
We adopt and affirm the June 13, 2003, decision of the Immigration Judge pretermitting the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). The record of proceedings reflects that the respondent departed the United States under a threat of removal in February 1998 (Exh. 5). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that such departure interrupted the period of the respondent’s continuous physical presence in the United States. See Vasquez-Lopez v. Ashcroft, 343 F.3d 961 (9th Cir. 2003); see also Matter of Romalez, 23 I&N Dec. 423 (BIA 2002). As the record fully supports the result of the Immigration Judge’s decision, we affirm the conclusion that the respondent failed to demonstrate eligibility for cancellation of removal.
 
The respondent has raised on appeal a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, essentially consisting of her prior attorney’s failure to question the “voluntariness” of the respondent’s February 1998, departure. However, other than advancing the aforementioned allegation on appeal, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements necessary to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. See Azanor v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2004); see also Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart from the United States, without expense to the Government, within 30 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security. See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to so depart, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
*2 NOTICE: If the respondent fails to depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the Department of Homeland Security, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Irena I. Karpinski, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Linda A. Dominguez
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This matter was last before us on February 2, 2004, when we dismissed as abandoned the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s order denying her motion to reconsider. The respondent now moves that we reconsider our prior decision. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion to reconsider has been filed out of time. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on February 2, 2004. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2), a motion to reconsider in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 30 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, the Board did not receive the respondent’s motion until August 6, 2004, which is clearly more than 30 days after that order. The respondent’s motion to reconsider has therefore been filed out of time. On October 4, 2004, the respondent filed a reply to the DHS’ opposition to her motion to reconsider. However, such reply does not cure the lateness of the respondent’s motion.
 
The respondent claims that she fell victim of ineffective assistance of her prior counsel who represented her during the proceedings before the Immigration Judge, and who filed on her behalf an appeal before this Board. The respondent claims that her prior attorney failed to timely file an appeal from an Immigration Judge’s order denying her application for relief from deportation. She also claims that the attorney failed to file an appeal brief with this Board. Finally, she claims that her prior attorney failed to promptly notify her of our February 2, 2004, order dismissing her appeal as abandoned, thus preventing her from filing a timely motion to reconsider. However, the respondent has failed to give her prior attorney notice of the nature of her complaint against him, and to offer him an opportunity to respond. Thus, the respondent has failed to meet the requirements necessary to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Moreover, a review of the record of proceedings reflects that our February 2, 2004, order was mailed on that date to the respondent’s last address of record. As such, the respondent has failed to keep us appraised of her current whereabouts. Accordingly, we find it inappropriate to reopen proceedings.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Rochelle A. Fortier Nwadibia, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Phillip D. Hatfield
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide wilt those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”). An Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States, following the respondent’s failure to appear for a hearing on April 1, 2003. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal the respondent contends that he never received the notice of hearing from his former attorney, because she sent the hearing notice to the wrong zip code for the respondent. He also asserts on appeal that he is eligible for adjustment of status based on his marriage to a United States citizen.
 
A review of the record reflects that the respondent was ordered removed in absentia on April 1, 2003. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on February 11, 2004, claiming that he did not receive notice of the hearing. On February 25, 2004, the respondent filed a response to the Government’s opposition to respondent’s motion to reopen, in which he claimed that he had provided his former attorney with his change of address in August 2000. However, the change of address provided by his former attorney contained an incorrect zip code for the respondent’s address. The respondent also submitted a declaration in support of his motion to reopen. Consequently, the respondent is alleging ineffective assistance of counsel in his response to the Government’s opposition.
 
The respondent failed to file his motion to reopen within 180 days after issuance of the final order, as is required under section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act. See Matter of A-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998) and Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998) (a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute an exception to the 180-day time limit under section 242B(c)(3)(A) of the Act).1 However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has determined that the statute of limitations to reopen an order of deportation is equitably tolled where the alien’s late petition is the result of deceptive actions by a representative. See Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir. 1999). Furthermore, we have held that ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescission of an in absentia order where the alien establishes that the failure to appear was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel and where the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), are satisfied. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec.472 (BIA 1996); see also Matter of Rivera, supra.
 
*2 Precedent from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit provides that while the requirements of Lozada are generally reasonable, they need not be rigidly enforced where their purpose is fully served by other means. Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000); Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237, 1240 n.6 (9th Cir. 2000). The Ninth Circuit determined that “Lozada is intended to ensure both that an adequate factual basis exists in the record for an ineffectiveness complaint and that the complaint is a legitimate and substantial one.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, supra. Furthermore, where the face of the record shows a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel, there has been substantial compliance with the rule. Id.
 
We find that proper notice was provided to the respondent. The record reflects that on July 5, 2001, notice of the hearing was mailed to the respondent’s former attorney of record. Consequently, the respondent received notice of the hearing in accordance with the Act. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); see also Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255 (BIA 1985) (holding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a). Furthermore, the respondent failed to comply with all of the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra; see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The respondent submitted an affidavit with his response to the Government’s opposition to his motion to reopen, and on appeal he has submitted a copy of a complaint he states was filed with the State Bar of California. However, there is no evidence that his former counsel was informed of the allegations of ineffective assistance and given an opportunity to respond. As noted by the Immigration Judge, the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is based solely on an erroneous zip code, which may or may not have been supplied to her by the respondent. If the respondent’s former attorney had been informed of the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, any response from her may have shed light on the origin of the erroneous zip code. This is not a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel that may excuse strict compliance With the Lozada requirements. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004) (court found that alien had not substantially satisfied Lozada when he failed to submit an affidavit and could not prove that he gave former attorney notice of the ineffective assistance allegations or an adequate opportunity to respond). Consequently, the respondent has failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, and he has failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear.
 
*3 We will next consider the respondent’s claim on appeal that he is eligible for adjustment of status. An alien is not required to rescind his or her deportation order under section 242B of the Act if he or she is pursuing an application for new relief, and provided there is no evidence that the respondent received the required warnings under section 242B(e) of the Act. See Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998).2 Rather, the motion to reopen is only subject to the regulatory requirements set forth at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c) and 1003.23(b)(3).3 Under these standards, the respondent’s motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s decision. He is accordingly precluded from having his motion considered under the general time limitations for a motion to reopen.4 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

We note that Matter of A-A-, supra, and Matter of Lei, supra, arose in the context of deportation proceedings pursuant to section 242B of the Act. However, as section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act sets forth identical language to that contained in section 242B(c)(3), we can apply the reasoning set forth in Matter of A-A-, supra, and Matter of Lei, supra, by analogy.

2

We note that Matter of M-S-, supra, arose in the context of deportation proceedings and involved the interpretation of sections 242B(e)(1) and (5) of the Act, relating to the limitation on discretionary relief for failing to appear at a deportation hearing. However, as section 240(b)(7) of the Act sets forth a similar limitation on discretionary relief for failing to appear at a removal hearing, we can apply the reasoning set forth in Matter of M-S-, supra, by analogy.

3

Pursuant to 8 C.F.R.§§ 3.2(c) and 3.23(b)(3), a motion to reopen for the purpose of acting on an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.

4

We therefore decline to address the issue of prima facie eligibility for relief from removal, or whether the respondent would deserve a favorable exercise of discretion.

File: A29 331 428 - New Orleans
November 18, 2004
 
IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul S. Zoltan, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Order: Sec. 241(a)(2), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)º - Nonimmigrant - remained longer than permitted
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s February 24, 2004, decision denying his motion to reopen and reconsider a December 17, 1999, order denying his prior motion to reopen proceedings to pursue relief under section 203 of the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2193, 2196 (“NACARA”), amended by, Pub. L. No. 105-139, 111 Stat. 2644. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On October 30, 1990, the respondent was ordered deported in absentia. On September 14, 1998, the respondent, through prior counsel, filed a motion to reopen to pursue NACARA relief. Because the respondent did not file a complete application by the statutory deadline, the Immigration Judge denied the motion on December 17, 1999, ruling that the respondent had not establish prima facie eligibility for relief. On February 5, 2004, the respondent, represented by new counsel, filed a motion to reopen and reconsider, alleging that his prior attorney rendered ineffective assistance when she submitted an incomplete application for NACARA relief. The Immigration Judge denied as untimely that motion on February 24, 2004. On appeal, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to equitably toll the filing period.
 
While the respondent is correct that the period for filing a motion to reopen or reconsider may be equitably tolled under certain circumstances, the respondent has not established that he is entitled to equitable tolling in this instance. See e.g., Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000). Even if prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to submit a completed application by the statutory deadline, we nevertheless find that equitable tolling is not applicable because the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in seeking reconsideration. See Ivoraski v. INS, supra, at 134; Pacheco v. Rice, 966 F.2d 904, 906-07 (5th Cir. 1992) (“Equitable tolling is applicable when, despite all due diligence, a plaintiff is unable to discover essential information bearing on the existence of his claim.”). More than 4 years passed from the Immigration Judge’s December 17, 1999, decision, and the respondent’s February 5, 2004, motion to reopen and reconsider. While the respondent asserted in his complaint to the State Bar of Arizona, alleging inadequate representation by his prior counsel, that “it seemed odd” that he had not received any correspondence from his attorney after the November 1999 filing, he waited several years before inquiring on the status of his case. Under these circumstances, we find that he did not exercise due diligence in exercising his rights. Thus, the Immigration Judge properly denied his motion to reopen and reconsider as untimely.1
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent also argues that his February 5, 2004, motion was not a motion to reconsider but rather a motion to reopen his 1990 in absentia deportation order, and asserts for the first time on appeal that the 180-day time limit for rescinding an in absentia order did not apply because he did not receive adequate notice of the October 30, 1990, hearing. While we decline to consider this notice issue because it was not raised before the Immigration Judge, we note that the Order to Show Cause reflects personal service on the respondent (Exh. 1). Moreover, even if we were to agree with the respondent that his 2004 filing is more appropriately a motion to reopen the in absentia deportation order, rather than a motion for reconsideration, it would still be untimely, since we have ruled that the 180-day time limit may not be equitably tolled even if the failure to timely file can be attributable to ineffective assistance of counsel. Matter of A-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 140 (BIA 1998).

IN EXCLUSION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT: Pro se1
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on September 30 1996, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s March 25, 1996, decision finding that she had abandoned her application for relief under the former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), because she had failed to timely file the application. On August 20, 2004, the respondent filed a motion to reopen the proceedings based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The record reflects that at a January 4, 1996, hearing, an Immigration Judge set a February 23, 1996, filing deadline for receipt of the respondent’s application for section 212(c) relief. Although the respondent’s counsel submitted supporting documentation on February 23, 1996, the application was not filed at that time. In the brief filed in support of the respondent’s appeal to the Board, the respondent’s former counsel conceded that he had thought that the cover letter and supporting documentation submitted by him on February 23, 1996, comprised the request for section 212(c) relief and was unaware that an Application for Advance Permission to Return to Unrelinquished Domicile (Form I-191) was required. He stated that he had attempted to file the application on March 26, 1996, but was informed that the file was closed. The record contains a cover letter dated March 22, 1996, in which the respondent’s former counsel states that he is submitting the necessary application and forms for the respondent, apologizes for the delay, and states that he was unaware an application needed to be filed.
 
The respondent has filed a motion to reopen the proceedings almost 8 years after the Board rendered its decision dismissing her appeal. The regulations specify that a motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). However, the deadline for motions to reopen may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 130 (2d Cir. 2000). An individual seeking to rely upon equitable tolling of a filing deadline must show that she has acted with due diligence. Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, supra; Iavorski v. INS, supra.
 
In the instant case, the respondent missed the filing deadline by more than 7 1/2 years, a substantial amount of time. However, the respondent alleges that her former attorney not only failed to timely file the section 212(c) application which she had completed and sent to him prior to its February 23, 1996, due date, but that he failed to notify her of the Immigration Judge’s decision, of his filing of an appeal on her behalf with the Board, and of the Board’s dismissal of the appeal. Additionally, she claims that her former counsel deceived her over the years by coming up with various excuses as to why her case was still pending. For example, he told her that a law had been passed shortly after her conviction precluding convicted felons from applying for section 212(c) relief but that the retroactive application of this law was being contested by a number of attorneys, that she was not an illegal immigrant because her case was still pending, that the courts had told him her documents were too old and they were looking for them, that the courts were trying to pull her Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) report to see if she was still living as a good citizen, and that he had sent a letter to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) asking about the status of her case. In October 2000, she applied for a reentry permit through and on the advice of her former counsel because she had planned to travel out of the country, but was informed that such application was denied because she could not provide proof that she was a lawful permanent resident. In September 2002, the respondent’s former counsel told her that she could again submit an application for section 212(c) relief in order to get closure in her case, and the respondent sent him a completed application and supporting documentation a month later. When she later questioned him about the application, he informed her that her case should be resolved in the spring of 2003, and she was later informed that her case should be resolved that summer. The respondent finally consulted another law firm about her case in February 2004. In June 2004, an attorney informed her of her former attorney’s failure to timely file the section 212(c) application and of the outstanding order of exclusion and deportation entered against her, and this motion to reopen was filed in August 2004.
 
*2 The respondent in the instant case complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and demonstrated that the order of exclusion and deportation entered against her was the result of having received ineffective assistance of counsel. A July 21, 2004, letter sent to the respondent’s former counsel details the above-mentioned facts and informs him that a motion to reopen will be filed with the Board based on the ineffectiveness of his representation. The Board has received no response from the respondent’s former counsel regarding the respondent’s allegations of ineffectiveness in failing to timely file the application and then engaging in a course of deceit and misrepresentation over a number of years in an apparent attempt to conceal the initial mistake. The record also reflects that a complaint was filed with the appropriate attorney disciplinary committee.
 
We find that equitable tolling is warranted in the instant case. Although the respondent missed the filing deadline for a motion to reopen by several years, this was due to her former counsel’s misrepresentations regarding the status of her case. We find that the respondent exercised due diligence in filing the motion shortly after she discovered her attorney’s malfeasance. We note that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the respondent’s motion. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court to allow the respondent to pursue an application for section 212(c) relief and any other form of relief for which she may now be eligible.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

IN RE: JOSE DE JESUS CABANAS OBREGON
File: AXX XX5 535 - Los Angeles
November 17, 2004
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Simon Salinas, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Tracy Nguyen,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated February 17, 2004, denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. In his motion, the respondent sought reopening claiming ineffective assistance of former counsel. Specifically, the respondent alleged that his former counsel failed to file an appeal of the Immigration Judge’s February 4, 2003, decision denying the respondent’s application for cancellation under 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The appeal is dismissed.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639.
 
It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 3367 (BIA 1998).
 
In addition, we have considered that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that an alien need not fulfill all the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, to assert a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel when the record reflects a clear and obvious case of such. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that attorney’s failure to timely file a suspension of deportation application was negligence). See also Escobar-Grijalva v. INS, 206 F.3d 1331 (9th Cir. 2000); Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 In the instant case, the respondent has not informed former counsel of the accusations against him or filed a complaint with the bar association against his former attorney. Reyes v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2003)(as the alien provided no evidence that the prior counsel received the notice of the motion to reopen and did not give the prior counsel an opportunity to respond to the allegations, the court held that the alien failed to comply with Lozada’s notice requirement).
 
The respondent also did not provide any evidence with the motion which indicates that he would have prevailed with his appeal, had one been filed. Based upon this lack of proof, we are unable to find that the respondent has satisfied the procedural requirements for proving that he was ineffectively represented or was prejudiced by his former attorney in these proceedings. Consequently, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is denied.

*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge.

We agree with the Immigration Judge’s finding that, while equitable tolling is available for untimely motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in pursing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.1 See e.g. Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002); Socop-Gonzalez, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). The Immigration Judge also correctly determined that the respondent’s motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status was filed untimely. Furthermore, only the District Director has authority to extend the time within which to depart voluntarily specified initially by an Immigration Judge or the Board. 8 C.F.R. § 240.26(f). Consequently, we find that the respondent’s arguments presented on appeal are without merit. Accordingly, the respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

The respondent states in his affidavit that his last actual contact with his former attorney, Mr. Blalock, was in March 2001. However, he did not file a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel until August 2003.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before the Board on January 20, 2004, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. Previously, on March 24, 2003, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision. The respondent on August 6, 2004, filed an additional motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of his former counsel. The motion will be denied.
 
An alien may file only one motion to reopen deportation proceedings, and the motion must be filed within 90 days of the final administrative decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The instant motion represents the respondent’s second attempt to reopen his proceedings and was not filed within 90 days of the final administrative order. The respondent requests that the filing deadline and the numerical limitation be equitably tolled because he received ineffective assistance of counsel in his appeal before the Board.
 
The doctrine of equitable tolling may, in certain circumstances, override the rules regarding motions to reopen in cases where the respondent has been defrauded by an individual purporting to provide legal representation. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218, 1224 (9th Cir. 2002). In order to receive the benefit of equitable tolling, a respondent who alleges ineffective assistance must first comply with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
Although the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, within whose jurisdiction this matter arises, has held that the Lozada requirements are “not sacrosanct,” the Ninth Circuit has also held that “the Lozada requirements are generally reasonable, and under ordinary circumstances the BIA does not abuse its discretion when it denies a motion to remand or reopen based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel where the petitioner fails to meet the requirements of Lozada.” Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000).
 
*2 Here, the respondent submitted a copy of a complaint to the State Bar of California, a copy of a letter sent to his prior attorney, and an affidavit regarding the alleged ineffective assistance of his prior attorney. However, the respondent’s affidavit does not describe “in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken … and what counsel did or did not represent to the respondent in this regard.” Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. Rather, the respondent describes very generally his agreement with his attorney regarding his appeal before the Board. Specifically, the respondent states that his attorney “assured ¿himº that he would file an appeal on ¿hisº behalf.” The respondent does not indicate whether his prior attorney agreed only to file a Notice of Appeal or whether he also agreed to file a brief on the respondent’s behalf.1
 
In the absence of an explanation of the representation agreement between the respondent and his prior attorney, we cannot determine whether the attorney failed in his duties to the respondent. In this regard, we note that this case does not involve “a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel” so as to excuse the respondent from satisfying the formal requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra. Castillo-Perez, supra, at 525-26. We therefore find that the respondent failed to show that he received ineffective assistance from his prior attorney.
 
Furthermore, even if we found that the respondent demonstrated that he received ineffective assistance from his prior attorney, we would find that there is no basis for abrogating the motions deadline or numerical limitation here. An individual seeking to rely upon equitable tolling must show that he acted with due diligence. See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001). Here, the respondent apparently learned of the Board’s dismissal of his appeal in March 2003. However, he did not seek a second opinion about his case until May 2004, shortly after he received a “bag and baggage order” from the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service). In the interim, the respondent’s prior attorney represented him in a motion to reopen before the Board and in an appeal to the Ninth Circuit. The respondent’s receipt of the “bag and baggage order” from the DHS did not stem from the alleged ineffective assistance of his prior attorney before the Board (not filing an appeal brief).2 Rather, the receipt of the “bag and baggage order” appears to have spurred the respondent to action over a year after the Board’s dismissal of his appeal, when the respondent claims to have received ineffective assistance of counsel. We therefore find that the respondent’s case does not merit equitable tolling. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
*3 ORDER: The motion is denied.

1

Although the Notice of Appeal filed on the respondent’s behalf indicated that his prior attorney would file a brief, we do not accept this as a substitute for a detailed explanation from the respondent as to the agreement between him and his prior attorney. We note that the respondent’s prior attorney included detailed arguments on the Notice of Appeal and that, because of this, we did not summarily dismiss the respondent’s appeal despite the fact that his prior attorney did not file a brief.

2

In fact, the respondent states that his prior attorney successfully obtained a stay of his deportation, thus preventing the DHS from deporting the respondent.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
William Gossard,
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. This case was last before us on February 5, 1998, when we administratively closed these proceedings based on the Presidential directive to implement deferral of enforced departure for certain Haitian nationals. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS,” formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service) has now requested that the proceedings be reinstated because the respondent’s application for adjustment of status under section 902 of the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act was denied, on January 8, 2002, because the respondent failed to submit evidence needed to establish his eligibility for HRIFA relief. The respondent did not respond to the request for reinstatement. Accordingly, we will grant the DHS’s request for reinstatement and we will adjudicate the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s May 5, 1992, denial of his motion to reopen.
 
On August 17, 1992, the respondent was granted an extension of time within which to submit an appeal brief, but he did not submit a brief. In 1999, his counsel filed a motion to withdraw his representation because the respondent failed to stay in contact with him or to otherwise cooperate in seeking relief from deportation. The Immigration Judge’s decision fully addressed his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and determined that a claim was not established under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Gbaya v. U.S. Attorney General, 342 F.3d 1219 (11th Cir. 2003) (reopening was properly denied where there was not substantial compliance with the Lozada requirements). On appeal, the respondent has not provided an adequate basis to disturb the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ifeoma A. Uche, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Yon Alberdi,
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. We adopt and affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge dated March 22, 2004. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994) (noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an Immigration Judge, in whole or in part, is “simply a statement that the Board’s conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the Immigration Judge articulated in his or her decision”).
 
The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on April 3, 2000. The respondent filed a pro se motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on June 24, 2002. The Immigration Judge granted the motion, reopened proceedings and scheduled another hearing for November 14, 2002. The notice of decision and hearing was mailed to the respondent at the address he provided in his motion to reopen. The respondent failed to appear at his November 14, 2002, hearing and the Immigration Judge entered another order of removal in absentia. On or about March 5, 2004, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen in which he addresses his absence from the April 3, 2000, hearing. With the motion, he included a copy of his ineffective assistance of counsel complaint filed with the Florida Bar against the counsel who represented him during his April 3, 2000, proceedings. The respondent did not address in any fashion his absence from the November 14, 2002, hearing. Consequently, the Immigration Judge was correct in denying the motion because the respondent was notified of the November 14, 2002, hearing and failed to explain his failure to appear.
 
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alan Lee, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Susan Egan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. The motion to reopen has been filed out of time and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on February 19, 2002. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (with certain exceptions), a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision. In the instant case, a motion to reopen would have been due on or before May 20, 2002. The record reflects, however, that the Board did not receive the motion until October 18, 2004. The motion to reopen was therefore filed out of time.
 
The respondent is currently incarcerated for not complying with the terms of voluntary departure granted her by the Immigration Judge. She requests that the Board take her case on certification (or sua sponte) and reopen proceedings on our own motion, claiming the voluntary departure instructions given by the Immigration Judge to her parents and herself were misleading and indicated that the restrictions surrounding a failure to comply with the voluntary departure conditions applied only in the event of arrest and removal from the United States. While the Board retains limited discretionary powers under the regulations to reopen or reconsider cases on our own motion, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), that power allows the Board to reopen proceedings sua sponte only in exceptional situations. In this case. even if we accept the respondent’s quotation of the Immigration Judge’s instructions as correct, we find that, especially in light of the respondent’s representation by counsel at the hearing, the argument regarding confusing instructions is not sufficient to warrant reopening.
 
In an addendum to the respondent’s motion to reopen, she makes a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, though we note the respondent has not complied with the criteria set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). We note also, for an untimely motion to reopen to receive the benefit of equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the alien must exercise due diligence in pursuing the case during the period to be tolled. The final administrative order was issued by the Board in February, 2002. Inasmuch as the respondent has waited over 2 1/2 years before filing the instant motion, she has not exercised due diligence in pursuing remedies available to her with regards to the alleged ineffective assistance violations.
 
Accordingly, he motion to reopen is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Raul Gomez, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on December 19, 2003, when we summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s September 19, 2002 decision that the respondent had waived his opportunity to be considered for cancellation of removal because the application was not filed by the required date. We note that the respondent was represented at that hearing by Terrence McGuire, Esquire. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen proceedings on September 7, 2004 alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. According to the respondent, Mr. McGuire was negligent in his representation, and also was working in conjunction with an individual unauthorized to practice law. The motion is denied. The respondent’s motion is untimely because it was filed more than 90 days after the date in which the final administrative decision by the Board was rendered. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has also held that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies to the time and numerical limitations for motions to reopen or reconsider during periods when a respondent is prevented from filing his motion because of deception, fraud, or error, provided that the respondent acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir.2002); Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, 272 F.3d 1176 (9th Cir. 2001); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir.1999). In the present case, the respondent was aware on September 19, 2002 that Mr. McGuire did not file his application for cancellation of removal on time, and therefore may have been the victim of attorney negligence. Having waited until September 7, 2004 to raise this issue establishes that he failed to pursue his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with due diligence. We therefore see no reason to equitably toll the 90-day statute of limitations for seeking reopening before the Board.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James C. Angleton, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
On January 21, 2004, the Board summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision. On August 6, 2004, the Board denied the respondent’s motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of his former counsel. The respondent has now filed a motion to reconsider. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. In our August 6, 2004, decision we agreed that the respondent had complied with the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In this regard, we note that former counsel was given an opportunity to respond to the respondent’s allegations, and he merely submitted a perfunctory denial stating, “I dispute your contentions and the allegations of your client about my ineffective assistance of counsel in my representation of him before the Immigration Court.” See Edguardo Quintanilla’s letter dated April 6, 2004, at Exhibit C attached to the motion.
 
In the motion to reconsider the respondent points out that subsequent to our August 6, 2004, decision, Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, at 858 (9th Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (holding that the proper prejudice standard for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, is “only whether ¿the attorney’sº deficient performance may have affected the proceedings.”) was decided. We shall grant the motion to reconsider in light of Maravilla v. Ashcroft. It appears that former counsel’s representation of the respondent prior to and during the removal hearing may have contributed to the Immigration Judge’s adverse credibility determination for the reasons contained in the respondent’s motion, and the allegations appear to be reflected in the record. Moreover, our assessment of the respondent’s allegations are enhanced by former counsel’s perfunctory response which did not explain why he disagreed with the respondent’s allegations. See Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 599 (9th Cir.2004); Matter of Lozada, at 639.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is granted, the removal proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
ORDER:
 
*1 PER CURIAM. On June 23, 2004, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction because it was untimely filed. We accordingly returned the record to the Immigration Court without further action. Now the respondent has filed a Correction to Motion to Reopen and Reconsider Exclusion Proceeding, Request for Acceptance of the Motion, which we will construe as a motion to reconsider due to the contents of the motion. The motion to reconsider will be denied.
 
The Board does not normally have jurisdiction over motions filed in cases where the Board never assumed initial jurisdiction, such as an untimely appeal. See Matter of Mladineo, 14 I&N Dec. 591 (BIA 1974). We retain jurisdiction over the instant motion to the extent that it challenges the finding of untimeliness or requests consideration of the reasons for untimeliness. See Matter of Lopez, 22 I&N Dec. 16 (BIA 1998).
 
A motion to reconsider asserts that at the time of the Board’s previous decision an error was made. It “questions the Board’s decision for alleged errors in appraising the facts and the law.” Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). We note that the respondent in this case has established no error of law or fact in our prior decision. Rather, the respondent asserts that due to ineffective assistance of counsel, the appeal was untimely filed. However, we note that the respondent has offered no evidence to support this claim. Therefore, we need not address this issue of ineffective assistance and we decline to reconsider our prior decision where the respondent has established no error in that determination.
 
Accordingly, the motion to reconsider is denied.
