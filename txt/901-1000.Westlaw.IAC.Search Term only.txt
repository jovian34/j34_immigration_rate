IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
George P. Mann, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jeremy Santoro
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopen
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on September 5, 2008. We remanded the record to the Immigration Judge to reevaluate the respondent’s motion to reopen, which was filed following an in absentia order of removal. On October 1, 2009, the Immigration Judge denied the motion, and the respondent filed this appeal. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard, and review all other issues, including whether the parties have met their burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
In our remand order, we agreed with the respondent’s assertion that prior counsel’s failure to file an entry of appearance, and failure to notify the court of a change of address on behalf of the respondent, are facts that if established, would lead to a finding that the respondent was a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We pointed out that the record is replete with evidence of malfeasance by the attorney in question, which could contribute to the respondent’s credibility. We remanded the record for the Immigration Judge to assess whether ineffective assistance of counsel prevented the respondent from receiving notice of her hearing.
 
On remand, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent did not prove that counsel in question was actually retained as her attorney for these removal proceedings or that she in fact did not receive her Notice to Appear and Notice of Hearing. The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge committed clear error in her factual findings.
 
As acknowledged by the Immigration Judge, the respondent complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to support her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. There is also an abundance of evidence that the counsel in question misrepresented his clients in various immigration matters. The outstanding issue is whether in fact the respondent had retained this counsel to represent her in removal proceedings. We find that the evidence of record supports the respondent’s contention that this was the situation; the Immigration Judge’s finding otherwise is clearly erroneous. The respondent submitted a detailed statement explaining her relationship with former counsel, payment receipts and other documentation, and an abundance of evidence regarding the attorney’s malfeasance in other cases. Further, the prior attorney failed to respond to the respondent’s allegations against him, and did not appear in court pursuant to the subpoena issued for him by the Immigration Judge (see Tr.at 13,20-21). Under the totality of these circumstances, we find the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent did not establish that she had engaged former counsel to represent her in removal proceedings to be clearly erroneous.
 
*2 The respondent has otherwise met her burden to show ineffective assistance of counsel which resulted in prior counsel’s failure to register any address changes with the Immigration Court. The respondent can therefore not be charged with receiving proper notice of her hearing. We will accordingly vacate the in absentia order and remand the record for further proceedings.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The in absentia order of removal is vacated, the removal proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

IN RE: CECIL LEE WILLIAMS
File: AXXX XX4 048 - Lumpkin, GA
March 29, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
*1 The respondent’s motion to reopen, to which the Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded, will be denied.
 
The Board issued a final order on January 7, 2011, concerning the respondent, who is from Panama. A timely motion to reopen was filed with the Board on January 28, 2011. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The Board on January 7, 2011, affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable as an aggravated felon and ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction. That is, on January 22, 2008, the respondent was convicted of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of a cocaine mixture, in violation of federal law. The Board also rejected the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his former attorney Glen Fogle, as the respondent failed to comply with the procedural requirements for making such a claim, and failed to show prejudice.
 
The respondent in his pending motion asserts that he has now met the requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
As before, however, the respondent fails to show prejudice stemming from the claimed actions of prior counsel. Dakane v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2005); Matter of Assaad, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra. “Prejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney’s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.” Dakane v. U.S. Atty. Gen., supra.
 
The respondent faults Fogle for not telling the Immigration Judge about “the positive aspects of my life and the ties that I have here in the United States” (Respondent’s Aff). However, having been convicted of an aggravated felony, the respondent is not eligible for relief from removal for this reason, and Fogle committed no error in conceding this at the removal hearing (Tr. at 7).
 
The respondent also argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from his criminal defense attorney, and has filed a motion to vacate the conviction. This does not change the finality of the respondent’s conviction for immigration purposes, unless and until it is overturned by a criminal court. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154, 156-67 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996).
 
*2 The pending motion will, therefore, be denied.
 
ORDER: The pending motion is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The request for a stay of removal is denied as moot.

File: AXXX XX8 254 - Houston, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Laura Sanchez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
John Donovan
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION:
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reopen alleging, inter alia, that his prior counsel was ineffective because he did not renew the application for adjustment of status that was based on an approved employment visa petition.
 
Even assuming that the respondent has a right to effective assistance of counsel to pursue discretionary relief such as adjustment of status, he has not demonstrated that ineffective assistance has caused him prejudice in pursuing that relief. See Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, 461 F.3d 605 (5th Cir. 2006) (rejecting claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on failure to pursue a discretionary waiver of relief from removal); Assaad v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 471 (5th Cir. 2004) (“because Assaad’s attorney’s allegedly deficient performance merely restricted his chances of receiving a discretionary waiver of his removability, we conclude that he has not alleged a violation of his due process rights”); see also Altamiro-Lopez v. Gonzales, 435 F.3d 547, 550 (5th Cir. 2006) (the denial for discretionary relief does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest).
 
As we stated in our last order, neither the Immigration Judge nor the Board may adjudicate the respondent’s application for adjustment of status because he is an arriving alien and he does not fall within the limited exception in 8 C.F.R. § § 245.2(a)(1)(ii), 1245.2(a)(1)(ii). The respondent’s argument to the contrary is not supported by the facts. The respondent was paroled into the United States on January 12, 1997, at which time neither his family-based nor his employment-based adjustment of status applications were pending (I.J. at 3). The only evidence of an employment-based adjustment application provided by the respondent is a copy of the one that was filed on December 21, 1999, based on a skilled worker petition with a priority date of August 29, 1997(MTR at 2, Tabs D, E).¿FN1º
 
We reiterate, since counsel still seems to have a different understanding notwithstanding our last decision, that removal proceedings-even after a final removal order has been entered-do not foreclose an arriving alien from an opportunity to apply for adjustment of status with U.S. Customs and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), which is also the appropriate forum for requesting a stay of the removal order pending its adjudication by USCIS. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 107 (BIA 2009).
 
*2 With regard to the respondent’s argument that his prior counsel caused him to abandon his application for cancellation of removal, even if such an argument implicated a due process violation in the Fifth Circuit, he has neither argued nor provided evidence of specific hardships to a qualifying relative that would have been presented in support of such an application. See Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, supra; Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003) (requiring a showing of prejudice in order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
We will, however, reopen the proceedings for the limited purpose of reinstating the 60-day voluntary departure period granted by the Immigration Judge on January 29, 2009.¿FN2º Our October 14, 2010, decision dismissing the respondent’s appeal otherwise remains undisturbed. Accordingly, we enter the following orders.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted for the limited purpose of reinstating the period of voluntary departure granted by the Immigration Judge.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reopen for purposes of pursuing adjustment of status is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s order and conditioned upon compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within 60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See section 240B(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.26(c), (f). In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be removed as provided in the Immigration Judge’s order.
 
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of 10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
 
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled, or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
 
*3 WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section 242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review, notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(I).

The respondent does not dispute that the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction over his family-based adjustment application.

2

The respondent has provided evidence that the voluntary departure bar was timely paid. Cf. Matter of Gamero, 25 I&N Dec. 164 (BIA 2010) (where the case was remanded to the Immigration Judge to issue a new voluntary departure order in a situation where no evidence that the bond was paid was provided to the Board, but it did not appear that the proper voluntary departure warnings were given).

Board of Immigration Appeals
IN RE: RUPERTO TELLEZ-MEZA
File: AXXX XX9 217 - Seattle, WA
March 28, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Debra A. Morales, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathan Love
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on September 3, 2010, at which time we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the respondent’s request for a continuance of the proceedings, and to grant the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS’s) motion to terminate proceedings. The respondent has now filed a timely motion to reopen proceedings, claiming ineffective assistance from his former counsel. The DHS opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
At his hearing, the respondent was found removable pursuant to section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act. In his motion, the respondent principally argues that his prior attorneys, Mr. Antonio Salazar, Esquire and Mr. Andrew Oliver, Esquire, failed to properly represent him before the Immigration Court and this Board, and therefore, inter alia, prejudiced his ability to apply for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a) of the Act. The basis of the respondent’s argument rest on two claims; both that his prior counsel did not pursue post-conviction relief in federal court, and that they failed to properly investigate his immigration status in the United States.
 
In support of his motion, the respondent has submitted documentation indicating that Mr. Salazar was disbarred in 2010. The respondent has also submitted an affidavit and a complaint against Mr. Salazar to the Washington State Bar, as well as photocopies of receipts indicating various money exchanges between Mr. Salazar and the respondent. Through current counsel, the respondent has submitted evidence that he filed a Motion to Vacate Judgment on October 10, 2010, in the Douglas County Superior Court, State of California, pertaining to his July 26, 2001, conviction for conspiracy for unlawful delivery of methamphetamine.
 
Among other arguments, the respondent argues that even though he hired Mr. Salazar, it was Mr. Oliver who represented him at the hearing. Without more, we can not find that this fact alone constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent did not object to Mr. Oliver’s representation at the hearing (Tr. at 1), and the respondent has failed to demonstrate any contract indicating the agreement he entered into with either Mr. Salazar or Mr. Oliver. Moreover, the respondent has not filed a complaint with Mr. Oliver or otherwise contacted Mr. Oliver regarding the parameters of his representation or to alert him to the current complaint against Mr. Salazar. Accordingly, we do not find that the respondent has set forth sufficient evidence, in accordance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to adequately craft an ineffective assistance of counsel claim regarding his prior representation by Mr. Oliver, Esquire.
 
*2 Moreover, a respondent claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show prejudice resulting from his attorney’s failure. Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1189 (9th Cir. 2004); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Even assuming some link between Mr. Oliver and Mr. Salazar, the respondent fails to make this showing. Inasmuch as the basis of his current motion rests on the alleged prejudice that he suffered due to his prior counsel’s failure to file a motion for post-conviction relief of his criminal conviction, he has not demonstrated that the Immigration Judge would have continued his case if such a motion had been filed prior to his hearing, or that the outcome might have changed were such a motion filed by Mr. Salazar or Mr. Oliver. The respondent’s counsel requested a continuance at the hearing so that he could file a motion to vacate the respondent’s criminal conviction “within two weeks” (Tr. at 5), but the Immigration Judge found no good cause for such a continuance because the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal would be denied due to the respondent’s inability to demonstrate that he was a lawful permanent resident (Tr. at 5).
 
The respondent argues, however, that his prior counsel failed to properly pursue relief from the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service’s June 11, 2001, termination of his conditional residence status and the denial of his Form I-751 waiver. He argues that if prior counsel had so pursued such relief, he might have been able to demonstrate lawful permanent resident status for purposes of cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act. We find this argument, at best, speculative. The respondent has presented no evidence in the current motion, or in prior proceedings, in support of his eligibility for lawful permanent resident status, and he has not indicated how he would pursue an appeal from his 2001 Form I-751 denial. Ineffective assistance of counsel is found only where the proceedings are “so fundamentally unfair that the alien is prevented from reasonably presenting his case.” Granados-Oseguera v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 993, 1001 (9th Cir 2005); Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir. 2004). The respondent has not made such a showing; accordingly, the motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Khagendra Gharti Chhetry, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Maria Lurye
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 This case was last before us on March 11, 2002, at which time we summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal for failure to file a brief. The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen proceedings on August 19, 2010. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). The respondent requests equitable tolling of these regulatory restrictions, and argues that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel from his prior counsel who represented him before the Board. He states that in 2002, he paid Mr. Charles A. Grutman, Esquire, $620 to file an appeal, but that the accompanying brief was not filed in a timely manner. The respondent argues that, subsequently, Mr. Grutman did not pursue any appeals or motions from this decision, but instead advised him to file an adjustment of status application under the Life Act. The respondent argues that if Mr. Grutman had filed a proper brief, he could have, inter alia, preserved the opportunity to file an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, or should have, at least, filed a timely motion to reopen before the Board in 2002.
 
The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has stated that “¿iºn a situation where ineffective assistance of counsel prevents an alien from having the opportunity to present his case for relief, the filing deadline for motions to reopen will be equitably tolled until the ineffective assistance is, or should have been, discovered by a reasonable person in the situation.” See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 171 (2d Cir. 2006); citing Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir. 2000); see also Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154, 157 (2d Cir. 2006). In this case, the respondent has submitted two affidavits. In his most recent affidavit, executed on October 27, 2010, he avers that in March of 2002, he could not find Mr. Grutman, and was informed by his replacement, Mr. Robert Kuhnreich, that Mr. Grutman had stopped practicing law. He states that Mr. Kuhnreich, Esquire informed him that he should “not worry about his removal order” and should instead continue to pursue his Life Act application. The respondent states that he expressed “displeasure” with Mr. Grutman’s representation, and that he ultimately hired Mr. Ronald Gill, Esquire to continue with his adjustment application. He indicates that his adjustment application was denied on June 13, 2007, and that he subsequently hired Mr. John Finnell, Esquire to counsel him. He asserts that he continued to complain about his prior attorneys, but that Mr. Finnell, Esquire told him that he did not have to “worry about the removal case.”
 
*2 Along with his affidavit, the respondent has, inter alia, submitted evidence that he filed a complaint against Mr. Grutman, Esquire, with the Supreme Court Appellate Division, First Judicial Department, Departmental Disciplinary Committee, New York. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), see also Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 153, 157 fn.3 (2d Cir. 2006). The respondent has also submitted evidence that he has notified Mr. Grutman, Esquire, about his complaint.
 
According to the respondent’s affidavits, he indicated that he was dissatisfied with Mr. Grutman during discussions with Mr. Kuhnreich, Esquire in 2002. He also indicates, in his most recent affidavit, that he was aware of the Board’s dismissal of his appeal in 2002.¿FN1º However, the pending motion was not filed until August 19, 2010. See Cekic v. INS, supra, at 170 (“no matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled”). While the respondent intimates that all of his subsequent attorneys failed to properly address his outstanding removal order, the respondent has not adequately explained why he did not file this motion until the receipt of his bag and baggage letter on July 26, 2010.¿FN2º This is so especially because, as the DHS argues in its response, the respondent’s appeal from the denial of his second adjustment of status application under the Life Act was apparently denied in 2009. Even were we to extend equitable tolling to the completion of this appeal process, the respondent still waited an additional year before filing the instant motion. In short, we find that the respondent has not demonstrated due diligence in presenting his arguments regarding Mr. Grutman’s alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. See Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127 (2d Cir. 2008).
 
The respondent has also submitted evidence in support of his applications for adjustment of status, cancellation of removal, and asylum and withholding of removal. Regarding the respondent’s adjustment application, he has now filed evidence that his United States citizen sister filed a Form I-130 on his behalf. However, the respondent has not submitted evidence that he is currently eligible for adjustment of status, or that he would be excepted from the regulatory time requirements for such a motion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). Regarding the respondent’s cancellation of removal application, the DHS correctly argues that the respondent does not have a qualifying relative to support his application pursuant to section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act. We also, similarly, find that the respondent has not indicated why he did not file this application at any time prior to his current motion.
 
*3 Regarding the respondent’s submitted Form I-589, we note that when the respondent conducted his airport interview in 1998, he indicated that he entered the United States “to work” and “for family” (Exh. 2). He also indicated that he had been residing in the United States since 1981 and that he had never been arrested anywhere in the world (Exh. 2). These statements contradict the claim submitted by the respondent in his recent Form I-589, and he has not explained why he failed to file an asylum application subsequent to his “flight from Pakistan” in 1981, or at any time prior to his most recent motion. The time and numerical limitation for motions to reopen do not apply to a motion to reopen proceedings to apply or reapply for asylum, based on changed country conditions, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); Malty v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir. 2004); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). The motion must state the new facts to be proved and must be supported by evidentiary material. Matter of J-J-, supra. The alien must show a “reasonable likelihood of success on the merits so as to make it worthwhile to develop the issues further at a full evidentiary hearing.” Matter of A-N- & R-M-N-, 22 I&N Dec. 953 (BIA 1999). In short, we do not find that the respondent has presented new and material evidence which would support an exception to the timeliness requirements.
 
The pending motion will be, therefore, denied.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

In his initial affidavit, dated August 16, 2010, he states that “Mr. Grutman, Esquire, did not inform me what happened to my appeal.” However, in his response to the DHS’ opposition, the respondent filed his second October 27, 2010, affidavit, indicating that he and Mr. Grutman, Esquire discussed the Board’s 2002 dismissal. Specifically, the respondent states that the “Immigration Judge ordered removal and Mr. Grutman wrote me a letter asking to remit $620 for appeal processing fee but failed to file a timely brief in my case … BIA rejected the appeal at that time and Mr. Grutman did not advise me to file a motion to reopen the case. Instead he advised me to submit an application for adjustment of status under the Life Act.” Accordingly, it appears that Mr. Grutman did, in fact, inform the respondent of the Board’s 2002 order.

2

In so finding, we note that the respondent’s initial August 16, 2010, affidavit (and the respondent’s affidavit to the Disciplinary Board) indicate that he was “shocked” when he received his bag and baggage letter. However, the respondent has failed to explain why he was so shocked. The respondent states, in his August 16, 2010, affidavit, that he consulted his current attorney on July 30, 2010, and was told that he received a bag and baggage letter because Mr. Grutman, Esquire, “did not file to the BIA a brief on time as required on my removal case.” However, the evidence in support of his motion indicates that a reasonable person would have known that he was under an order of removal. See Cekic v. INS, supra, at 170.

*1 On September 17, 2010, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’ September 1, 2009, decision denying his application for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). On December 13, 2010, the respondent filed this timely motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The Board will grant the motion and remand the record to the Immigration Judge.
 
The Immigration Judge noted the respondent’s “considerable equities,” but also considered the respondent’s “significant adverse factors,” including his criminal history, and determined that the respondent did not merit the desired relief as a matter of discretion. See Immigration Judge’s Decision at 8-10. In reaching his decision, the Immigration Judge emphasized that the respondent offered minimal evidence to corroborate key elements of his claims relating to his residency, hardship, assets, and rehabilitation.
 
The respondent seeks reopening based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his former attorney. He specifically argues that his former attorney did not inform him that he needed to prove that he merited the relief as a matter of discretion, and that she failed to inform him of the type of evidence required to prove that he is deserving of a favorable exercise of discretion. With this motion, the respondent has offered evidence of his compliance with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Sswajje v. Ashcroft, 350 F.3d 528, 533 (6th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent has also offered evidence that he earned income in 2009, and that he filed income tax returns in 2007 and 2008. Further, he has offered a letter from Yemen Arab American Center for Economic and Social Service attesting to community service, and a letter from the mother of this United States citizen children describing his character.
 
The letter from the mother of the respondent’s children reveals that the respondent became the parent of his third United States citizen child after the Immigration Judge’s decision. See Exhibit 6. In light of this new evidence, the additional evidence pertaining to the respondent’s character, and the respondent’s “considerable equities” as noted by the Immigration Judge, we will grant this timely motion to reopen. Accordingly the motion to reopen will be granted, and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further consideration of the respondent’s equities in conjunction with his application for relief.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order.

IN RE: LILIA JUAREZ GONZALEZ
File: AXXX XX6 603 - Bloomington, MN

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Brianna Zuber Green, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Daniel J. Pornschloegl
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On December 17, 2009, an Immigration Judge ordered the respondent’s removal from the United States in absentia because she failed to appear for her hearing. The respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge on April 16, 2010, and that motion was denied on April 29, 2010.¿FN1º The respondent filed a timely appeal from this decision. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). Upon de novo review, we find that the respondent has not established that proceedings should be reopened.
 
An order of removal issued following proceedings conducted in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5), may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen which demonstrates that the alien failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances, because he or she did not receive proper notice of the time and place of the hearing, or because he or she was in federal or state custody and failed to appear through no fault of his or her own. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27 (BIA 1995); Matter of Gonzalez-Lopez, 20 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 1993). The term “exceptional circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien, such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of an immediate relative, but not including less compelling circumstances. Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
In her motion, the respondent maintains that she was not served with notice in the Spanish language. However, the charging document is not required to be provided to an alien with a translation in her native language. See section 239 of the Act. As the record reflects and as noted by the Immigration Judge, the Notice to Appear (NTA) was received by the respondent by certified mail as shown by her signature on the receipt. She admits receiving the notice of hearing (NOH). Given this record, we find that the respondent was properly served with notice of her hearing.
 
The respondent maintains that she was told by someone named Virgilio not to attend her hearing. She argues in her motion to reopen that the reason she did not appear for her hearing is because she relied upon the advice of Virgilio, whom she thought had legal experience.
 
*2 Ineffective assistance of counsel may be an exceptional circumstance warranting rescission of an in absentia removal order. Habchy v. Gonzales, 471 F.3d 858, 862 (8th Cir. 2006). An alien asserting that ineffective assistance amounted to an exceptional circumstance must however fulfill the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d sub nom. Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Habchy, supra, at 862; see also Ochoa v. Holder, 604 F.3d 546, 548 n. 1 (8th Cir. 2010) (Lozada is “our substantive and procedural compass” in assessing ineffective assistance claims in immigration proceedings). The alien must (a) “support his claim with an affidavit alleging facts relevant to the ineffective assistance¿,º” (b) “inform the former counsel of the allegation and give her an opportunity to respond¿,º” and (c) show that he has either filed a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority regarding representation (i.e. the state bar association) or explain why he has not done so. Habchy, supra, at 862 (citing Lozada, 19 I. & N. at 639).
 
In certain circumstances, ineffective assistance of a non-attorney immigration consultant or notary can form the basis of relief in the context of removal proceedings. See, generally Albillo-De Leon v. Gonzales, 410 F.3d 1090, 1099 (9th Cir. 2005). However, it must be established that an alien suffered prejudice from the negligent advice of a non-attorney purporting to be a licensed attorney. See generally Varela v. INS, 204 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 2000) (an alien may be denied due process if he or she receives negligent advice from an individual who falsely purports to be an attorney); Lopez v. INS, 184 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 1999). The alien must, however, establish that she suffered prejudice from the conduct of a non-attorney, she was unaware of the fraud, and she remained ignorant of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on her part. See Lopez v. INS, supra.
 
Here, although the respondent states that she believed Virgilio had legal experience (Respondent’s Affidavit in support of the Motion to Reopen), there is no evidence that he held himself out as a licensed attorney. Regardless, even if the respondent believed that Vergilio was an attorney or held himself out as such, the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not satisfy the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra. See generally Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 514 F.3d 1224, 1225-26 (11th Cir. 2008) (suggesting that Lozada applies to ineffective assistance of counsel claims rendered by non-attorneys); Omar v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 647, 651 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding that the Board’s decision to deny the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim against a non-attorney immigration consultant based on non-compliance with Lozada was “neither arbitrary nor capricious”).
 
*3 Under these circumstances, we do not find that the respondent received what may be tantamount to ineffective assistance to counsel. See generally Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, 327 F.3d 892, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that there is a “crucial difference” between ineffective assistance of counsel and ineffective assistance of an immigration consultant); see also Singh-Bhathal v. INS, 170 F.3d 943, 946 (9th Cir. 1999) (concluding that the erroneous advice of an immigration consultant does not constitute an exceptional circumstance requiring reopening of the proceedings). The respondent avoided her hearing based on a non-attorney’s advice despite being notified to appear and of the consequences for failing to do so.
 
We note that the respondent has proffered a copy of Virgilio’s business card on appeal. We do not consider evidence first submitted on appeal; rather, we review the record before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 73-74 & n. 10 (BIA 1984); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988). Even if we were to construe the respondent’s additional evidence as a motion to remand, the respondent has not shown that this evidence is new and previously unavailable. Moreover, the card does not establish that Virgilio held himself out as an attorney. We therefore find that a remand is not warranted.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in her decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Julie A. Endy, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Nancy K. Vande Walle
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated January 28, 2010. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings in which he was ordered removed in absentia on October 9, 2002. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i),(ii).
 
On appeal, the respondent reiterates that he did not receive proper notice of his hearing. We agree with the decision of the Immigration Judge.¿FN1º The record reflects that the respondent was personally served with a Notice to Appear (NTA) on April 27, 2002. See I.J. at 1; Exh. 1. Following various continuances, the San Antonio Immigration Court sent a hearing notice to the respondent’s former attorney of record, Jose Salvador Tellez, Esquire, scheduling the respondent’s hearing for October 9, 2002. See I.J. at 2; Exh. 2. There is no indication that the hearing notice was returned to the Immigration Court and the respondent acknowledges that his former attorney received the notice.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent received proper notice inasmuch as written notice of his hearing was provided to his attorney of record. See section 240(b)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A); Matter of Barocio, 19 I&N Dec. 255, 259 (BIA 1985) (finding that notice to an alien’s counsel constitutes notice to the alien); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26(c)(2); 8 C.F.R. § 1292.5(a) (providing that whenever a person is required to be given notice, such notice shall be given to the attorney or representative of record, or to the person himself if unrepresented). The record contains a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative (Form EOIR-28) for Mr. Tellez, as required by regulation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1292.4(a).
 
We are also not persuaded by the respondent’s argument that he did not hire Mr. Tellez and that after the respondent was released from custody he did not have any contact with Mr. Tellez or his associates. Here, the respondent does not claim that he did not know Mr. Tellez, he acknowledges that he was aware of Mr. Tellez’s efforts in securing his release from custody, and form EOIR-28 was properly filed in the respondent’s case. We therefore agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent received proper notice.
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent argues exceptional circumstances because his attorney did not inform him about the date and time of his hearing, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is untimely as it was not filed within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s in absentia order. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii); see also Vaz Dos Reis v. Holder, 606 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2010) (stating that with respect to motions to reopen in absentia proceedings courts typically treat ineffective assistance of counsel claims as an exceptional circumstance). In addition, we agree with the determination of the Immigration Judge that even if equitable tolling is taken into consideration, the respondent has failed to establish due diligence in filing his motion to reopen. See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir. 2008) (finding that a request for equitable tolling was essentially a contention that the Board should exercise sua sponte authority over an untimely motion, and that the court lacks jurisdiction to review a decision by the Board not to exercise this authority).
 
We also find that the respondent has not established an exceptional circumstance herein to warrant the sua sponte reopening of these proceedings. The respondent was personally served with a NTA on April 27, 2002, ordering him to appear before an Immigration Judge in San Antonio, Texas at a date and time to be set. See Exh. 1. He has not established what efforts he took to determine the status of his removal proceeding after receiving the NTA more than 7 years before he filed his motion to reopen. We find no basis for sua sponte reopening. See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (stating that the Board’s power to reopen cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations).
 
We turn now to the respondent’s suggestion on appeal that he is eligible for adjustment of status based upon his marriage to a United States citizen. Attached to his brief on appeal he submitted documentation relating to a visa petition filed on his behalf. We do not consider evidence first submitted on appeal; rather, we review the record before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 73-74 & n.10 (BIA 1984); Matter of Haim, 19 I&N Dec. 641 (BIA 1988) Even if we were to construe the respondent’s additional evidence as a motion to remand, we would deny it because the respondent was personally served with a NTA which indicates that he received oral notice in the Spanish language of the consequences of failing to appear for his removal hearing. He is therefore statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status.¿FN2º See section 240(b)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(7); see also Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998) (explaining that an in absentia deportation order need not always be rescinded before it can be reopened). In sum, we find no reason to disturb the decision of the Immigration Judge denying the respondent’s motion to reopen.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

We observe that the Immigration Judge made a clearly erroneous factual determination. In particular, the Immigration Judge erroneously stated that a motion to continue a hearing scheduled for June 22, 2002, was granted by the Immigration Judge. See I.J. at 2. The record, however, reflects that the hearing was scheduled for June 20, 2002, and that the motion to continue filed by the respondent’s former attorney on May 28, 2002, was denied. A hand-written notation on the bottom of the motion to continue indicates that it was denied on June 13, 2002. Moreover, the record reflects that on June 20, 2002, the respondent appeared for a hearing with his former attorney and admitted to the charges listed in the Notice to Appear. See Exh. 1; Tr. at 1-2. We find, however, that the Immigration Judge’s factual determination to be harmless as he otherwise correctly determined that the respondent received proper notice. Neither party raises this issue on appeal.

2

We also observe that the visa petition submitted on appeal was filed after April 30, 2001, and the NTA indicates that the respondent was not inspected and admitted. Therefore he has not established prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. See Exh. 1; Matter of Rajah, 25 I&N Dec. 127 (BIA 2009) (discussing prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) º - Crime involving moral turpitude
  
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s November 18, 2010, decision denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Rwanda, was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on April 27, 2004 (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). On January 25, 2007, the respondent was convicted in the Waltham District Court, Massachusetts, for the offenses of witness intimidation and violating an abuse prevention order in violation of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 268 section 13B(1) and Chapter 209(A) section 7, respectively (I.J. at 1). On June 23, 2008, the respondent was ordered removed from the United States by the Immigration Judge (I.J. at 1). The respondent was thereafter removed from the United States in December 2008.
 
On October 22, 2010, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen based on the vacatur of his conviction for witness intimidation (I.J. at 2). The respondent argued that his conviction for violating an abuse prevention order is not a crime involving moral turpitude and that the motion deadline should be equitably tolled because he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his criminal proceedings (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge denied the motion for lack of jurisdiction and, alternatively, as time-barred (I.J. at 2-3). The respondent appeals.
 
Despite the respondent’s contentions on appeal, we find no reason to disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion for lack of jurisdiction (I.J. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3) (2010). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, where this case arises, has held that the amendment to the regulation precluding consideration of a motion to reopen after an alien has departed the country did not abrogate the Attorney General’s authority to enforce the regulation barring, after the alien’s departure from United States, a motion to reopen by or on behalf of the alien who was subject of removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1); Pena-Muriel v. Gonzales, 489 F. 3d 438 (1st Cir. 2007); see also Matter of Armendariz-Mendez, 24 I&N Dec. 646, 660 (BIA 2008).
 
Further, that a vacatur of conviction upon which an alien’s deportability was premised may be an appropriate basis for reopening a deportation order does not establish a due process right to such reopening after the alien has departed the country. See Pena-Muriel v. Gonzales, supra. An alien has received due process where, at the time of his departure, he had been convicted of crimes triggering the relevant deportation provisions, his removal proceeding came to a lawful conclusion before his conviction was vacated, and, with benefit of appropriate notice, he received a hearing before an Immigration Judge and an opportunity for appeal. See id. (due process does not require giving alien continuous opportunities to attack executed removal orders years beyond alien’s departure from the country). Thus, in this case, the Immigration Judge properly concluded that he lacked jurisdiction over the respondent’s motion to reopen filed after his removal from the United States.
 
*2 Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Tatiana S. Aristova, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Lisa A. Compagno
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The Department of Homeland Security filed a timely motion to reconsider the Board’s July 8, 2010, decision, which granted the respondent’s motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and remanded the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings on the issue of her inadmissibility under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i). The respondent opposes the DHS’s motion to reconsider and has submitted a separate motion to remand and stay removal.
 
The DHS argues that the Board issued its July 8, 2010, decision granting the respondent’s motion without considering the arguments stated in its opposition brief. We first point out that there was no DHS opposition to the motion associated with the record of proceedings at the time of our last decision. The record does include the DHS’s request for an extension of time to respond to the respondent’s motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, but we apparently did not rule on the request. In any event, we have reviewed the DHS’s untimely opposition brief, a copy of which was submitted with its motion to reconsider, and conclude that it would not have altered our decision to grant the respondent’s ineffective assistance motion.
 
We reject the DHS’s argument that the respondent did not suffer prejudice by her former counsel’s concession to the fraud charge. The respondent acknowledges that arriving aliens, with a limited exception that is not implicated in this case, may not have an adjustment of status application adjudicated in removal proceedings. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2009). However, the finding of inadmissibility in the removal proceedings based on the fraud charge impedes the respondent’s ability to adjust her status in the proper jurisdiction, United States Customs and Immigration Enforcement, unless she is able to qualify for a waiver. Thus, her counsel’s concession to the charge caused her prejudice. Accordingly, we deny the DHS’s motion and again remand the record to the Immigration Judge pursuant to our July 8, 2010, decision.
 
Our decision denying the DHS’s motion renders moot the respondent’s separate motion to remand and stay her removal.
 
ORDER: The DHS’s motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings that are not inconsistent with our July 8, 2010, decision.

APPLICATION: Motion to remand
 
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge’s October 13, 2010, decision denying his motion for a continuance to seek post-conviction relief.¿FN1º During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to remand. The motion will be granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on February 5, 2002 (I.J. at 1; Exh. 1). On March 3, 2010, the respondent was convicted for the offense of possession of a stolen vehicle in violation of Nevada Revised Statutes section 205.273. On September 14, 2010, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged based on his conviction (I.J. at 3-4). On October 13, 2010, the Immigration Judge held an additional hearing and denied the respondent’s request for a continuance to seek post-conviction relief. The respondent appealed the denial of his request for a continuance.¿FN2º
 
During the pendency of the respondent’s appeal, he filed a motion to remand including evidence that his March 3, 2010, conviction has been set aside by the criminal court at least in part on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not responded to this filing. Under these circumstances, we find it necessary to remand the record to the Immigration Judge to determine whether the respondent’s conviction has been vacated with the burden of proof on the DHS to show that the conviction was not set aside solely to avoid immigration consequences. See Nath v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 1185 (9th Cir. 2006).
 
Accordingly, the motion will be granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.
 
ORDER: The motion is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for entry of a new decision.

The Immigration Judge issued his decision regarding the respondent’s removability separately on September 14, 2010. That decision is incorporated into the Immigration Judge’s October 13, 2010, decision.

2

The respondent originally filed his Notice of Appeal with the Board in a timely manner. The appeal, however, was rejected. The respondent resubmitted his appeal within 15 days. Therefore, we will treat the respondent’s appeal as timely filed.

*1 On January 24, 2011, the respondent submitted an untimely motion to reopen his removal proceedings that administratively final on September 20, 2010, when the Board dismissed his appeal. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion is denied.
 
The respondent asserts that he is now eligible to pursue either a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act or cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act because a state court granted a motion he filed pursuant to New York State Criminal Procedure Section 440.10(I)(h), and vacated the judgment of his conviction. A copy of the court’s order is appended to the respondent’s motion. However, the court order does not reflect that the criminal conviction at issue was vacated. Rather, court found that a further hearing “on the issue of whether the ineffective assistance of counsel caused any prejudice” to the respondent was required (Court Order at 7). Thus, the respondent’s conviction remains effective for immigration purposes, and sua sponte reopening is not warranted based on the evidence now before us. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
David W. Williams, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, moves to reopen these proceedings seeking a further opportunity apply for adjustment of status. Section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.§ 1255(a). Motions to reopen must be filed within 90 days of our final order. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Our final order was issued on May 27, 2009. Therefore, the instant motion, filed on July 6, 2010, is untimely. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a response, so it will be deemed unopposed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The motion will be granted.
 
In our last decision, we concluded that the respondent’s 2002 conviction for possession of a controlled substance, which resulted in deferred adjudication, remains a conviction for immigration purposes under the law in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We agreed with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s first conviction in 1990 for possession of a controlled substance was accorded deferred adjudication, and would have qualified for Federal First Offender Act (FFOA) treatment. 18 U.S.C. § 3607; Matter of Manrique, 21 I&N Dec. 58 (BIA 1995) (federal policy of leniency to first-time drug offenders would be extended to those aliens who had not previously been accorded first-offender treatment under any law); see also Lujan-Armendariz v. INS, 222 F.3d 728 (9th Cir. 2000). The second conviction in 2002, however, would not have been afforded FFOA treatment under federal law, and we agreed that it remained a conviction under immigration law regardless of the respondent’s satisfactory completion of the diversionary program.
 
The respondent argues in his motion that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during proceedings and while the matter was on appeal. However, we need not reach this issue. Since our last decision, the Ninth Circuit has distinguished a suspended sentence, which is a predicate for a conviction under section 101 (a)(48) of the Act, from “an unconditional non-incarceratory suspended sanction,” concluding that the latter cannot be a predicate for a conviction for purposes of removal proceedings. Retuta v. Holder, 591 F.3d 1181, 1188 (9th Cir. 2010). In the respondent’s criminal proceeding for the second offense, he pled guilty, and the judge found that there was a factual basis for the defendant’s plea. However, the judge deferred entry of judgment and imposed a $100 diversion restitution fee and noted a 1 day sentence of time served.
 
*2 The respondent was placed on 24 months deferred entry of judgment, which he completed satisfactorily. He was then allowed to withdraw the plea of guilty, which was set aside and the case was dismissed pursuant to section 100.3 of the California Penal Code. Given the intervening case law, and considering the totality of the circumstances, we find that the unopposed motion presents exceptional circumstances warranting sua sponte reopening pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); see Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). On remand, the parties should address the applicability of Retuta v. Holder, supra, to this case. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is granted sua sponte.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Andrew L. Friedman, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondents, natives and citizens of the Dominican Republic, are mother and daughter. On May 20, 2002, the Board summarily dismissed the respondents’ appeal for failure to file a promised brief or statement. Subsequently, we located the respondents’ brief which had been filed at the Board on September 8, 1999. On August 5, 2002, we vacated the May 20, 2002, decision as to each respondent. On August 22, 2002, the Board affirmed without opinion the results of the decision below and designated the Immigration Judge’s decision as the final agency determination. In a decision on September 3, 2009, we denied as untimely a motion to reopen proceedings filed only by the respondent daughter and declined to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen proceedings.¿FN1º A motion to reopen proceedings, filed on behalf of both respondents, was received by the Board on June 16, 2010. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondents claim that reopening is warranted based on ineffective assistance by Vina Fleisig, Esquire, their former attorney. This motion to reopen is untimely as to both respondents (filed more than 90 days after our final administrative decision on August 22, 2002) and number-barred as to the respondent daughter (exceeds the single motion to reopen permitted). See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). However, the respondents seek reopening based on equitable tolling of the time period for reopening based on the ineffective assistance claim.
 
On January 7, 2009, the United States Attorney General issued a decision setting forth standards for claims involving ineffective assistance of counsel, but this decision was subsequently vacated by the current Attorney General. Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009). Pending rulemaking procedures, the Board was directed to “apply the pre-Compean standards to all pending and future motions to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, regardless of when such motions were filed.”
 
Aliens raising an ineffective assistance claim in a motion can have the time limits on motions equitably tolled. See Iavorski v. United States INS, 232 F.3d 124, 129-133 (2d Cir. 2000). Aliens seeking to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim must establish 1) that counsel’s performance was so ineffective as to have impinged on the fundamental fairness of the proceedings because counsel’s conduct was such that competent counsel would have acted otherwise; and 2) counsel’s performance must have resulted in prejudice to the aliens. See Romero v. United States INS, 399 F.3d 109, 112 (2d Cir. 2005), citing U.S. v. Perez, 330 F.3d 97, 101 (2d Cir. 2001). Under both Compean and pre-Compean standards, due diligence in pursuit of all claims has been required. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir.2006) (“¿Nºo matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled.”).
 
*2 We acknowledge that the lead respondent/mother has complied with the complaint requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Zheng v. U.S. Department of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 46-47 (2d Cir. 2005). However, compliance with the Lozada requirements does not, in and of itself, warrant equitable tolling due to ineffective assistance. In the documents submitted in support of the motion, e.g. Exhibit D at 29 and Exhibit Q at 73, the respondents have not indicated when they retained current counsel and/or became aware of any claimed ineffective assistance. We find that the respondents have not affirmatively demonstrated that they exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled. See Cekic v. INS, supra; Iavorski v. United States INS, supra. Separately, we note that the respondents’ ineffective assistance claim is primarily based on failure of prior counsel to file any brief on appeal (Exh. D at 28; Exh. Q at 73). The Board previously acknowledged that a brief on appeal was submitted and vacated the May 20, 2002, decision erroneously dismissing the appeal for failure to file a promised brief or statement. Consequently, the respondents’ contentions that their prior attorney failed to file a brief on appeal are without factual foundation. Accordingly, the motion to reopen will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen and request for a stay of removal are denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carlos Martinez-Couoh, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; stay
 
*1 On August 19, 1998, the respondent failed to appear for her removal hearing and was ordered removed in absentia by the Immigration Judge. The respondent subsequently filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge, which was denied in a March 1, 1999, decision. The respondent appealed the Immigration Judge’s denial, but the Board summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal in a March 22, 2002, decision. On September 1, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reopen with the Board based on the alleged ineffectiveness of her former counsel. For the reasons set out below, the respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent’s motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred and will be denied. The final order in these proceedings was entered by the Board on March 22, 2002. Generally, a motion to reopen in any case previously the subject of a final decision by the Board must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of that decision, and only one may be filed. Sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A) & (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). A request for rescission of an in absentia order of removal based on “exceptional circumstances” must be filed within 180 days after the date that the order of removal is issued. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3) and 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The present motion was filed on September 1, 2010, well beyond the filing deadlines. In addition, the respondent previously filed a motion to reopen that was denied by the Immigration Judge on March 1, 1999.
 
However, aliens raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a motion can have the time limits on motions equitably tolled. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). Aliens relying on equitable tolling have the burden of demonstrating that they exercised due diligence in discovering the fraud or error.
 
We find that the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen does not qualify for equitable tolling. The respondent has not demonstrated that she exercised the requisite diligence in filing the instant motion. The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on August 19, 1998, and on March 22, 2002, the Board summarily dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s March 1, 1999, decision denying her motion to reopen. However, the respondent waited until September 1, 2010, to file the instant motion, and has not demonstrated what she did between March 2002 and September 2010 to protect her rights or when she definitely learned of her prior counsel’s alleged incompetence (see id). Given the respondent’s delay in obtaining her current counsel, and the lack of evidence regarding steps she took to preserve his rights from 2002 to 2010, we find that the respondent did not act with due diligence. See Singh v. Gonzales, 491 F.3d 1090, 1096 (9th Cir. 2007) (refusing to toll where immigrant failed to investigate suspicions of incompetence for 6 months). In any event, the respondent has not submitted the requisite application for cancellation of removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).
 
*2 Finally, the respondent has not shown that an “exceptional situation” exists that would warrant the Board’s exercise of its discretion to reopen these proceedings sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999) (stating that “as a general matter, we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations”). Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s request for a stay is denied.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Joshua E. Bardavid, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 On October 5, 2010, the Board denied a motion filed by the respondent seeking to reopen the Board’s February 28, 2001, decision. The respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider that decision on November 1, 2010. On January 10, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued an order incorporating a stipulation filed by the parties. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
 
The stipulation filed by the parties remanded the record to allow the Board to consider whether the respondent established that he acted with due diligence in pursuing a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c). In view of the court’s remand order, and upon further review of the record, including the indications of ineffective assistance of counsel and the representations made by the respondent regarding due diligence, we will reopen this case. On remand, the respondent should be afforded an opportunity to pursue a section 212(c) waiver of inadmissibility. We make no findings with regard to the final determination as to the respondent’s eligibility for the requested waiver.
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be entered. In view of our decision reopening this case, the respondent’s motion to reconsider is moot.
 
ORDER: The decision of the Board dated October 5, 2010, is vacated, the respondent’s motion to reopen is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.

Shaheewa Jarrett Gelin
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent is a citizen of Honduras. On November 23, 2010, an Immigration Judge ordered his removal from the United States noting that the respondent did not file for any form of relief from removal. This appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent states in his Notice of Appeal that he is married to a United States citizen and is the father of citizen children. He requests an opportunity to remain in the United States. However, the respondent has not presented any evidence indicating that a visa petition has been filed on his behalf. We further are unable to identify any form of relief from removal that the respondent is eligible to seek. The respondent suggests on appeal that he is a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. He has not satisfied any of the procedural requirements for establish that claim. See Dakane v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 399 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. 2005); Gbaya v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 342 F.3d 1219 (11th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:

ON BEHALF OF THE DHS:
 
Timothy Maguire
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on August 3, 2010, when the Board denied the respondent’s third motion to reopen as untimely and number-barred and not excepted from the filing requirements imposed on motions to reopen removal proceedings. The Board rejected the respondent’s assertion that the time and numerical limits for filing his motion to reopen should be equitably tolled due to the alleged deficient performance of two non attorneys, both of whom allegedly advised and or represented the respondent after the completion of his proceedings before both the Immigration Judge and the Board. The Board concluded that the respondent did not substantially comply with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), did not demonstrate the required prejudice, and did not show due diligence. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, supra; Wang v. Bd. of Immigration Appeals, 508 F.3d 710 (2d Cir. 2007); Debeatham v. Holder, 602 F.3d, 481, 486 (2d Cir. 2010). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). On December 10, 2010, the respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, filed a fourth motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
To the extent the respondent seeks reconsideration, the motion is untimely. See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Moreover, to the extent the respondent’s motion rests on previously raised issues related to the alleged deficient performance of one or both of the non attorneys, the respondent has not identified any issue that was not considered in the Board’s previous decision, nor has he identified any error of fact or law in that decision that would alter the outcome. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). The respondent’s apparent request for reconsideration is therefore denied.
 
*2 Similarly, the respondent’s present motion to reopen is untimely and number-barred and has not been shown to qualify for any exception to the time and numerical limitations imposed on motions to reopen removal proceedings. As previously found, the respondent has not demonstrated the required prejudice stemming from his prior attorney’s alleged deficient performance. See Matter of Assaad, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra; Debeatham v. Holder, supra. See also Matter of Compean, supra. The respondent has not sufficiently described or submitted or pointed to any evidence supporting his claim that his two United States citizen step children, who were not included in the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal, would suffer the requisite level of hardship upon the respondent’s removal. Nor does the record support the respondent’s claim that he was at any stage in his proceedings before either the Immigration Judge, the Board, or the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, either unaware that he was granted the privilege of voluntary departure or not properly advised of his obligations in connection with such grant. Further, the respondent has not shown due diligence in making his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Wang v. Bd. of Immigration Appeals, supra.
 
Finally, the respondent has not demonstrated an “exceptional situation” that would warrant sua sponte reopening of these proceedings as a matter of discretion. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (stating “the power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship”); see also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999).
 
On this record, the respondent has not provided us with an adequate reason to overlook the fact that his motion is untimely and number-barred. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion and related request for a stay of removal are denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 On January 20, 2011, the respondent submitted a “motion to reopen” the Board’s November 26, 2010, decision dismissing his appeal. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which is denied.
 
To the extent that the respondent avers the Board committed error in our decision, this aspect of his motion is one seeking reconsideration. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). It is untimely as it was filed more than 30 days after the Board’s final administrative decision. Section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). The respondent also contends that former counsel provided him with ineffective assistance. However, the respondent did not file a complaint with the bar authorities in Louisiana. Rather, he sent a letter of complaint about Mr. Abrusley to the American Bar Association, which is a private association that does not have the authority to engage in any disciplinary action against Mr. Abrusley. Moreover the respondent has not demonstrated any prejudice as he has not shown either that he was not removable as charged, or that he was eligible for any relief from removal. As the respondent has not satisfied the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, reopening on this basis is not warranted. Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Eric M. Pedersen
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)º - Convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s April 27, 2010, decision ordering him removed from the United States. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Canada, admitted that he was convicted of, among other offenses, theft in the 3rd degree under the Revised Code of Washington, for which he was sentenced to 365 days imprisonment (Tr. at 17; I.J. at 2). We find no error in the Immigration Judge’s determination that this offense qualifies as an “aggravated felony” under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G), to wit: a theft offense for which the term of imprisonment was at least 1 year (I.J. at 2).
 
As an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, the respondent is ineligible for most forms of relief from removal, including asylum, cancellation of removal, voluntary departure, and waiver of inadmissibility. We find no indication that the respondent has expressed any fear of returning to Canada.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that his prior attorney did not inform him of certain filing dates and did not adequately communicate with him (Respondent’s Notice of Appeal; Respondent’s Brief). We construe these arguments as a claim of ineffective assistance by prior counsel. However, other than advancing an allegation of ineffective assistance, the respondent has not met any of the requirements necessary to establish a claim for ineffective assistance pursuant to our precedent cases governing ineffective assistance. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003).
 
We are mindful of the holding by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Castillo-Perez v. I.N.S., 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000), wherein the court held that the requirements for ineffective of assistance under Matter of Lozada, supra, are “not sacrosanct” and that “substantial compliance” may be sufficient to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. However, we find that ineffective assistance of counsel in the instant case has not been established. The respondent’s failure to meet any of the requirements under Matter of Lozada, supra, and the lack of explanation for the failure to do so, does not demonstrate “substantial compliance” as established in Castillo-Perez v. I.N.S., supra.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX0 953 - Newark, NJ

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Ismael Gonzalez, Esquire
*1 In a decision dated February 12, 2009, an Immigration Judge sustained the charges of removability, concluded that the respondent was ineligible for relief from removal, and ordered her removal to the Dominican Republic, the country of which she is a native and citizen. The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues, through counsel, that the Immigration Judge should have offered her additional time to seek post-conviction relief. The respondent maintains that the case should be “reopened” so that she can be given ample time to seek post-conviction relief and apply for cancellation of removal. In his appellate brief, counsel argues that proceedings should be terminated, pending a decision on her motion to vacate her conviction before the New Jersey Supreme Court. Counsel also argues that, due to ineffective assistance of counsel in the criminal proceedings, the respondent “has standing to vacate” her guilty plea.
 
The respondent was charged in a New Jersey State court of possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to manufacture, distribute or dispense, which charge was amended to conspiracy, in violation of section 2C:5-2 of the New Jersey Statutes. On July 30, 2004, respondent was convicted of the conspiracy charge. The respondent, through counsel, admitted the charges in the Notice to Appear and conceded her removability under sections 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) and 1127(a)(2)(B)(I); counsel also conceded that the respondent’s criminal conviction is final (Tr. at 3-4).
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. §1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
At the February 12, 2009, hearing, counsel conceded (Tr. at 13) that the respondent is ineligible for relief, counsel mentioned (Tr. at 10-11) possibly receiving “one more adjournment.” The following exchange then occurred (Tr. at 13):
Immigration Judge: “But you were saying something about a continuance. Is the Court supposed to interpret that as a motion somehow?”
 
*2 Counsel: “No, Your Honor.”
 
Immigration Judge: “All right. So then, do you rest?”
 
Counsel: “I rest, yes.”
 
 
The Immigration Judge never ruled on a motion to continue, because a motion to continue was never presented at the hearing. Although counsel argues on appeal that the proceedings should be continued or terminated to allow the respondent an “ample amount of time” to attack her conviction, including on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel in the criminal proceedings, her conviction is final for immigration purposes, unless and until it is overturned. See, e.g., Matter of Polanco, 20 I&N Dec. 894 (BIA 1994); see also Paredes v. Attorney General, 528 F.3d 196 (3rd Cir. 2008).
 
The appeal brief was filed in April 2009, and counsel has provided no subsequent indication that the respondent has been successful in collaterally attacking her conviction. The following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismisses.

IN RE: MIGUEL ANGEL GUTIERREZ-MELENDEZ
File: AXXX XX2 990 - Omaha, NE
February 11, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Laz Pittman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christopher L. Ferretti
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In a decision dated July 30, 2010, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen seeking to rescind his removal order that was entered on an in absentia basis. Through newly-retained counsel, the respondent has filed this motion to reopen, which the Department of Homeland Security opposes. Although this motion is untimely, we have been persuaded to reopen the respondent’s proceedings sua sponte pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
The respondent presents numerous allegations of ineffective assistance provided by multiple attorneys (as well as a non-attorney whom he believed to be an attorney) in connection with his failure to appear at his hearing, his subsequently-filed motion to reopen before the Immigration Judge, and his ensuing Board appeal. See Motion to Reopen filed December 13, 2010, as supplemented by two filings on January 6, 2011 (“first supplement” and “second supplement”), and one on January 21, 2011 (“third supplement”).
 
This case presents an unusual arrangement of legal representation. An attorney and a paralegal (located in Illinois) referred the case of the respondent (who lived in East Moline, Illinois) to an out-of-state firm (located in Cleveland, Ohio) to provide representation in connection with his removal hearing scheduled to be conducted in Omaha, Nebraska. Yet, the respondent never met the attorneys in Ohio, and the paralegal and attorney in Illinois continued to provide assistance and dispense legal advice directly to him. After considering the evidence now presented, and the various ineffective assistance claims advanced vis-a-vis the attorney and paralegal in Illinois (with whom the respondent directly dealt), and the attorneys in Ohio, we conclude that a sufficient showing has been made to account for the respondent’s failure to appear at his hearing, and to warrant that a new hearing be conducted in his case.
 
The record now establishes that attorney Michele Norton (who was associated with the Ohio firm of Svetlana Schreiber & Associates Co., LPA) was actually the respondent’s attorney of record before the Immigration Court.¿FN1º See second supplement at 14. She filed a change of venue motion, which apparently was not adjudicated in advance of the scheduled removal hearing. There is no indication that Ms. Norton ever met, or had any direct communication with, the respondent. Instead, she claims to have kept the paralegal in Illinois¿FN2º abreast of developments in his case. It is said that in turn, the paralegal communicated such developments to the respondent.
 
*2 This arrangement concerning legal matters create the potential for miscommunication. The potential also existed for misunderstandings concerning who was actually representing the respondent. Such appears to have been the case here, as the respondent believed he was being represented by the paralegal in Illinois, whom he believed to be an attorney.
 
An attorney of record has a responsibility to ensure that an alien she represents is provided with adequate notice of his need to appear at his removal hearing. This does not appear to have been done here. There is no indication that attorney Norton ever advised the respondent in writing of the need for him to appear at his December 12, 2008, removal hearing, unless the change of venue motion she had filed in his behalf was approved. As to comparable oral notice, attorney Norton explains that she believed that the respondent had been so advised in a timely fashion by a paralegal/Spanish-language translator in her own office, but she concedes that she later learned that this was not the case. See Motion to Reopen filed in Immigration Court, at 3.
 
Although phone messages may have been left on the respondent’s voice mail by attorney Norton’s firm on December 11 and 12, 2008, regarding his need to appear at his master calendar hearing on December 12th, such notice was not provided in a timely manner, given that the hearing was scheduled for 9:00 a.m. on December 12th in Omaha, Nebraska, and the respondent lived in Illinois. Further, the respondent contends he was specifically advised not only by the paralegal in Illinois, but also by the attorney in Illinois on December 11, 2008, that he did not have to appear at his master calendar hearing on December 12th.
 
Based on the circumstances presented here, and the totality of the evidence presented, we now reopen the respondent’s proceedings, vacate our July 30, 2010, decision, and remand the record for a new hearing following proper notice to consider anew the respondent’s removability and, if necessary, his eligibility for any form of relief for which he may qualify.¿FN3º
 
Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s removal proceedings are reopened sua sponte.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Board’s July 30, 2010, is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

File: AXXX XX7 092 - Houston, TX
February 3, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Aron M. Mandl, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 In a decision dated May 4, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5). The respondent filed a timely appeal from that decision. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Pursuant to section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 723 (BIA 1999). The term “exceptional circumstances” is defined by the Act as “exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.” Section 240(e)(1) of the Act.
 
Ineffective assistance of counsel can qualify as an “exceptional circumstance” for purposes of rescinding an in absentia order where the alien failure to appear is due to his attorney’s errant instruction. Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Atty. Gen. 514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir. 2008); Matter of Grijalva-Barrera, 21 I&N Dec. 472, 473-74 (BIA 1996).
 
The respondent argues that his case should be reopened due to the ineffective assistance of a relative of a friend, named Marcos,¿FN1º a notario who held himself out as an attorney. We concur with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion was both untimely and he did not establish that his failure to appear was caused by “exceptional circumstances.”
 
The respondent argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling and cites to circuit court authority from circuits other than the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case lies. However, the Eleventh Circuit has found that the 180-day filing deadline is not subject to equitable tolling or other exceptions, even in the case of ineffective assistance of counsel or where the alien acts blamelessly. See Anin v. Reno, 188 F.3d 1273, 1278-79 (11th Cir. 1999); see also Abdi v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir. 2005) (concluding that petitioner’s motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, filed after the 90-day deadline in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), could not be equitably tolled).
 
*2 Moreover, the Eleventh Circuit has held that the Board does not abuse its discretion by filtering ineffective-assistance claims through the Lozada requirements when considering a motion to reopen. See Gbaya v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 342 F.3d 1219, 1223 (11th Cir. 2003) (per curiam). Although the Eleventh Circuit has not explicitly held that Lozada applies to claims of ineffective assistance rendered by non-attorneys, such a conclusion was implicit in its decision in Montano Cisneros, supra.
 
Here, although the respondent maintains that he is in the process of contacting the Texas Bar regarding his claim against the notario, the respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Specifically, the respondent failed to file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of the notario’s responsibilities, and further has not explained why he has not done so.
 
For the foregoing reasons, and those articulated by the Immigration Judge in his decision, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of the motion to reopen, pursuant to our authority at 8 C.F.R. §1003.1(e)(5).
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

To the extent the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in referring to Marcos as the respondent’s relative, we find harmless error.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Carolina Colin-Antonini, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joy Lampley Fortson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed from the March 15, 2010, decision of the Immigration Judge denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings conducted in absentia on December 8, 2009. The respondent’s request for oral argument is denied. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings. The respondent acknowledges personal service of the Notice to Appear while in custody. The DHS released the respondent after requiring him to post bond, wear an ankle bracelet monitor, and report to a DHS officer monthly. The respondent acknowledges that notice of hearing was properly mailed to him at the last address he provided, but states that his wife received the mail and did not inform him of the notice of hearing, as she thought it applied to her pending removal proceedings. The respondent admits that he was reminded by a DHS officer of his December 8, 2009, hearing when he reported as required in November of 2009. However, the respondent forgot about his hearing date. The respondent claims that his attorney misfiled his case and failed to inform him of his hearing date, which amounts to ineffective assistance.
 
On appeal the respondent argues that the issue in this case is not whether he had notice of his hearing, as the respondent acknowledges proper delivery. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27, 32 (BIA 1995). Rather, the respondent’s argues that ineffective assistance of counsel justifies reopening on the basis of “exceptional circumstances.” We have recognized in the past that the deficient performance of counsel can constitute exceptional circumstances excusing a failure to appear at a scheduled hearing. Matter of N-K- & V-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 879 (BIA 1997); see also Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934 (9th Cir. 2003).
 
In Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we held that motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. See also Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592 (9th Cir. 2004).
 
*2 We disagree with the respondent’s assertion in a footnote that he has complied with the Lozada requirements (Respondent’s Br. at 8). We note that the former counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned is the same attorney who filed the motion to reopen. Even if we consider the motion to reopen sufficient to satisfy the first two prongs of Lozada, the respondent has not satisfied the third. The respondent has not stated whether a complaint has been filed with his former counsel’s disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. Therefore, we affirm the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings.
 
Even assuming arguendo that the respondent satisfied the Lozada requirements, we conclude that the circumstances in this case do not qualify as “exceptional circumstances” under section 240(e)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. To qualify as such, the circumstances must be “beyond the control of the alien.” Id. The failure of the respondent to communicate with his wife concerning important documents being delivered to their household was within the control of the respondent. Moreover, the forgetfulness of the respondent and his failure to attend a hearing, even after being reminded by a DHS officer, were also within the control of the respondent. Therefore, the failure to appear at his removal proceedings is not excused, and we decline to set aside the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to reopen his in absentia removal order. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent is a native and citizen of Canada. On March 3, 2009, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s request for voluntary departure. On June 4, 2009, the respondent attempted to file a motion to reopen his proceedings based on his marriage to a United States citizen. The respondent did not attach the required filing fee (I.J. at 1). On June 11, 2009, the motion was filed with the proper fee (I.J. at 1). On June 17, 2009, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to reopen as untimely (I.J. at 1). The respondent appeals this decision.
 
On July 2, 2009, citing the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), the respondent filed a motion to reconsider arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in the filing of his motion to reopen. On July 15, 2009, the Immigration Judge construed the motion to reconsider as a motion to reopen and denied it as numerically-barred. The respondent has not appealed that decision. Moreover, while the respondent’s appeal was pending, the I-130 filed by his United States citizen wife was approved. Therefore, the respondent filed a motion to reopen before this Board based on the approved I-130. See Attachment A to Motion to Reopen.
 
In light of the approval of the respondent’s visa petition, we will remand this case to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s application for adjustment of status. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Bindhu Vijayan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Wendy Leifer
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on June 7, 2010, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance by his former counsel. On July 7, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reconsider. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must identify an error of fact or law in the Board’s prior decision. See section 240(c)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (finding that a motion to reconsider must allege a material factual or legal error or argue a change in law); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991) (noting that the very nature of a motion to reconsider is that the original decision was defective in some regard). The respondent has not identified any error in the Board’s last decision.
 
The respondent first claims that the Board erred in finding that the respondent failed to substantially comply with the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). We observed that the motion to reopen did not reflect that the respondent’s former counsel had been informed of the allegations leveled against him and that the former counsel had been given an opportunity to respond. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639 (given the potential for abuse, the alien’s former counsel must be given an opportunity to present his version of events if he so chooses). The respondent now claims, for the first time, that he sent a carbon copy of the bar complaint to his former counsel. Also, for the first time, he has submitted a sheet of paper carrying the notation, “CC: Figeroux & Associates, Attorney at Law, 26 Court Street, Suite 701, Brooklyn, NY 11242.” This is new evidence that was not submitted with the motion to reopen.
 
Furthermore, as the DHS has observed in its opposition statement, the respondent’s current motion does not even address several significant points in the Board’s June 7, 2010, decision. We explained in that decision that although the respondent described his interactions with his former counsel while he was considering marriage to a United States citizen, he did not address what actions he took, or when he took them, to inform his former attorney that the marriage had actually taken place. The respondent never established that his former attorney was informed, within the 90-day motion to reopen period, that the marriage had taken place. Thus, the respondent did not establish that ineffective assistance was the reason his motion to reopen to seek adjustment of status was not timely filed.
 
*2 Also, the respondent did not demonstrate how any alleged ineffective assistance of counsel prejudiced him, given that the visa petition filed on his behalf by his wife was denied. Without an approved visa petition, the respondent is not able to adjust his status. Accordingly, the failure to file a timely motion to reopen for the purpose of seeking adjustment of status has not been shown to have resulted in prejudice.
 
The motion to reconsider does not identify an error in the Board’s last decision. The motion will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reconsider is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thomas V. Massucci, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jane H. Thomson
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before us on February 12, 2008, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s denial of motion seeking reopening and rescission of an in absentia order of removal that was issued on December 11, 2006.
 
The respondent, through new counsel, filed the instant motion with the Board on May 10, 2010. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, arguing that it exceeds the restrictions on motions, that it does not present any new facts, and that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied the respondent’s petition for review of our last decision on October 1, 2008.
 
In the instant motion to reopen, the respondent does reiterate the same arguments previously made by her former counsel regarding his incorrect belief that venue had been changed and that he consequently advised the respondent that her appearance was not required at the hearing scheduled to be conducted in the San Antonio immigration court on December 11, 2006. However, the respondent now seeks reopening based on a new claim that her counsel’s erroneous advice constitutes ineffective assistance. There is no issue here regarding the respondent’s receipt of proper notice of the hearing and a motion to reopen claiming that exceptional circumstances prevented her non-appearance was due within 180 days of the in absentia order. Section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(5)(C)(i). Therefore, the motion is untimely.
 
Even if the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit recognized the doctrine of equitable tolling in cases where the filing of a timely motion to reopen an in absentia order is prevented by ineffective assistance of counsel, we would not find it to apply here. Both the Immigration Judge’s decision and our February 12, 2008, dismissal of her appeal made it clear that a change of venue had not been granted and that her prior counsel’s advice that she did not need to appear was erroneous. The respondent does not claim that she was not informed of the basis for those decisions and offers no explanation for why she did not earlier pursue a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. She has thus not acted diligently.
 
We likewise do not find that the circumstances presented here are so extraordinary that, over three years after the final in absentia order was entered, we should now exercise of our sparingly invoked discretion to reopen the proceedings sua sponte, particularly since the respondent has neither argued that she has any defense to the removal charge nor demonstrated a colorable claim for relief from removal. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (the rules governing motions are intended to bring finality to proceedings and the Board’s sua sponte authority is not meant to be used as a cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might cause hardship). See Patel v. INS, 803 F.2d 804, 807 (5th Cir. 1986) (holding that a due process challenge to an in absentia order requires a demonstration of prejudice). Accordingly, we deny the motion.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Mahmoud Ramadan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The motion is denied. On November 8, 2010, the respondent, a native and citizen of Senegal, filed a motion to reopen and reconsider the Board’s decision dated September 30, 2010, dismissing the respondent’s appeal. However, the respondent’s request for reconsideration is untimely. See section 240(c)(6)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). Moreover, the respondent has not identified any issue that was not considered in the Board’s previous detailed decision, nor has he identified any error of fact or law in that decision that would alter the outcome. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider).
 
The Immigration Judge granted the respondent several prior continuances to pursue his October of 2006 appeal of the government’s decision denying his application for adjustment of status (Resp. Brief at Tabs C-D; Exh. 7). The respondent neither submitted nor described evidence demonstrating that the denial of the last request for another continuance was erroneous. Nor did he submit any other evidence demonstrating his eligibility for any other form of relief. Under the circumstances, the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent’s request for another continuance. See also Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785, 788-94 (BIA 2009) (recognizing that the denial of a motion for a continuance is permissible where it is based on the number and length of prior continuances coupled with other relevant factors such as the lack of evidence indicating that the denial of the I-130 petition was erroneous, despite a pending appeal).
 
Further, inasmuch as the respondent has not submitted or pointed to any evidence demonstrating his eligibility for adjustment of status or any other form of relief, the respondent has not sufficiently demonstrated that he suffered any prejudice by the alleged action or inaction of his former counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
*2 On this record, the respondent has not sufficiently demonstrated that further hearings are warranted. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion and related request for a stay of removal are denied.

IN RE: TASHTHED HAIDER KABIR
File: AXXX XX4 231 - Atlanta, GA
January 21, 2011
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Andrew P. Johnson, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On June 8, 2010, the Board denied the respondent’s motion to reopen, which was based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent asserted that his former counsel, George E. Lee, Esquire, failed to notify him about his immigration court hearing until the night before, when it was too late for the respondent to make the trip from New York to Atlanta. The former counsel sent another attorney to the immigration court and this attorney did not admit Attorney Lee’s error to the Immigration Judge. The respondent’s failure to attend his hearing led to his being ordered removed in absentia. Attorney Lee’s error was not acknowledged in either the motion to reopen or the subsequent appeal, both of which were filed by Lee’s law firm.
 
The respondent’s last motion claimed that a bar complaint had been filed against Attorney Lee, and that Attorney Lee had been sent a copy of the complaint. The motion further claimed that proof of the complaint and notice to counsel were included with the motion. However, no such evidence was included. The respondent’s motion was denied because it failed to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent has now filed the missing evidence with a statement that due to a clerical error it was not included with the last motion.
 
Considering the totality of circumstances presented in the respondent’s present motion, which has not been opposed by the Department of Homeland Security, the proceedings will be reopened on our own motion under the provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge to vacate the in absentia order of removal and provide the respondent with a new hearing.
 
ORDER: Proceedings are reopened under the provisions of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings not inconsistent with this order.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 On December 1, 2010, the respondent submitted a motion to reopen the Board’s August 25, 2008, decision dismissing his appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision finding him ineligible for relief from removal. The motion is denied.
 
The respondent’s motion is untimely as it was filed more than 2 years after the expiration of the deadline for such motions. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent contends, however, that former counsel provided him with ineffective assistance, so that reopening is nonetheless warranted. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897-99 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent essentially avers that former counsel, Michael Jacob, erred by conceding removability as charged rather than arguing that the respondent’s conviction did not render him deportable as it was not for a crime of violence. He also asserts Mr. Jacob erred by not pursuing a petition for review before the circuit court. In his motion, the respondent also argues that his conviction was not for a crime of violence. This issue was previously discussed in our decision, and any motion to reconsider that decision is untimely.
 
The respondent has not satisfied the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, supra. While he has submitted evidence indicating that he has filed a grievance against Mr. Jacob, there is no evidence that he has informed Mr. Jacob of the allegations against him, and afforded him an opportunity to respond. Similarly, he has not supported his motion with an affidavit setting forth “in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken,” as well as any representations made by counsel to the alien, as required. Id. Further, the respondent has not shown that he exercised due diligence in the more than 2 years in between the issuance of the Board’s decision, and the filing of the instant motion. Iturribarria v. INS, supra at 897-99. He has not explained what actions, if any, he undertook with regard to his case during that period. Given these issues, we find that the respondent has not demonstrated that his motion should be exempt from the statutory time-bar on motions to reopen. Accordingly, the motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thomas E. Moseley, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent filed a motion to reopen on December 3, 2010. The Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal on January 27, 2010, so the motion was untimely filed. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion. Although the motion is untimely, we will reopen proceedings under our sua sponte authority at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
The respondent was found subject to removal based on two Louisiana convictions for distribution of marijuana, and attempted possession of a firearm with narcotics. The respondent presents evidence that, on October 19, 2010, his request for post conviction relief was granted in state court. The “Memorandum in Support of Application for Post-Conviction Relief” argued that the respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel concerning the immigration consequences of his guilty plea, citing Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), and also argued that the second conviction violated his right to be free of double jeopardy. According to a declaration of criminal counsel, attorneys representing Louisiana filed no opposition to the application for post-conviction relief.
 
The Board finds that the uncontested evidence presented shows that the underlying convictions which served as the basis for the respondent being subject to removal have been vacated due to a defect in the criminal proceeding. If a court with jurisdiction vacates a conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the respondent no longer has a “conviction” within the meaning of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Act. Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006)(conviction vacated pursuant to Ohio law for failure of the trial court to advise the alien defendant of the possible immigration consequences of a guilty plea is no longer a valid conviction for immigration purposes).
 
As the respondent is no longer subject to removal from the United States based upon the charges against him, removal proceedings against the respondent are terminated.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Diane Dodd
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Panama, who was previously granted lawful permanent resident status in the United States, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 12, 2010. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal based on his criminal conviction.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
On January 22, 2008, the respondent was convicted of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of a cocaine mixture, in violation of federal law. A record of this conviction was entered into the record of proceedings. See Exh. 2. See also 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41(a). Cf. Fequiere v. Ashcroft, 279 F.3d 1325, 1327 (11th Cir. 2002). In addition, the respondent admitted the conviction, both personally and through counsel. See Tr. at 7, 10-11. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.41(d), 1240.10(c). Cf. Fequiere v. Ashcroft, supra, at 1327. Based on this evidence, the Immigration Judge found the conviction proved. See I.J. at 1-2.
 
The respondent was charged with being removable for having been convicted of a controlled substance violation and an aggravated felony relating to conspiracy and illicit trafficking in a controlled substance. See Exh. 1. The respondent conceded removability through counsel. See Tr. at 7. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged. See I.J. at 2.
 
The respondent personally expressed no fear of return to Panama. See Tr. at 11. The respondent requested no relief, either personally or through counsel, and the Immigration Judge concluded that he was ineligible for relief. See Tr. at 7, 11-12; I.J. at 2.
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent argues that his counsel provided him ineffective representation. However, the respondent has failed to fulfil the prerequisites for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
The respondent did not attach to the appeal a sworn affidavit setting out the alleged facts necessary to show a prima facie claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. This affidavit should have identified what his former counsel did or failed to do and identified how the former counsel’s action or inaction negatively affected the outcome of the respondent’s case. The affidavit should have also indicated that the respondent has notified the former counsel of the allegation of ineffective assistance, enabling the former counsel to respond to the allegation. In addition, the affidavit should have indicated that a complaint has been filed against the former counsel with the appropriate disciplinary authorities. See Matter of Grijalva, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
Moreover, we find no prejudice here. See Matter of Assaad, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra. We find that the respondent’s admissions and the conviction record in the record of proceedings prove he is removable as charged in the notice to appear by clear and convincing evidence. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(a); Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276, 286 (1966). Cf. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.15, 1240.10. We also find no error in the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent is ineligible for relief from removal.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION

ON BEHALF OF DHS:

Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order in this case on October 5, 2004, and denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider that order on December 30, 2004. On July 7, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied the respondent’s petition for review of those decisions, finding that the record showed, inter alia, that the respondent understood the consequences of waiving appeal and accepting only voluntary departure (DHS Opposition to the Motion, Exh. A). The respondent has now filed an untimely motion to reopen asking us to revisit his case and reopen the proceedings sua sponte in light of the 9th Circuit’s subsequent decision in Vasquez v. Holder, 602 F.3d 1003 (9th Cir. 2010). The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion.
 
We do not find that Vasquez v. Holder, supra, represents a fundamental change in law warranting reopening of this case outside of the strict deadline. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7) (imposing a general 90-day deadline for the filing of a motion to reopen); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c) (same). See Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999) (emphasizing the importance of administrative finality and finding that the Board will exercise sua sponte authority to reconsider a case under new law only when the change in law is fundamental in nature and not merely an incremental development in the state of the law).
 
Rather, the court in Vasquez acknowledged in dicta a long-standing Board precedent decision holding that, unlike the situation then before the court, if a petitioning spouse has withdrawn a visa petition it is treated as though it had never been filed and the alien whose conditional permanent residence has been terminated may apply for a section 216(c)(4) waiver. Vasquez v. Holder, supra, at 1009 citing Matter of Mendez, 20 I&N Dec. 833, 838 (BIA 1994). Vasquez v. Holder did not constitute a fundamental change in law with respect to the respondent’s eligibility to seek a section 216(c)(4) waiver, and we do not find that the circumstances here otherwise present an extraordinary situation warranting the exercise of our sua sponte authority to reopen outside of the strict statutory and regulatory limitations on motions. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (the rules governing motions are intended to bring finality to proceedings and the Board’s sua sponte authority is not meant to be used as a cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations where enforcing them might cause hardship).
 
*2 To the extent that the respondent is again asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against the attorney who represented him at his final hearing, he has already made such a claim against this attorney, which was rejected by the Board and the Ninth Circuit, that did not include any assertions regarding his eligibility for a section 216(c)(4) waiver. The respondent has not satisfactorily demonstrated a basis to equitably toll the 90-day deadline in order to argue an entirely different theory of ineffective assistance and/or due process violations. Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that equitable tolling will be applied where the alien is prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error so long as the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error). Accordingly, we deny the motion as untimely.
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eduardo A. Masferrer, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Remand, termination
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, who was admitted to the United States as an immigrant on or about August 30, 2005, filed a timely appeal of an Immigration Judge’s September 28, 2010, decision, sustaining the charges of removability against him; denying his request for a continuance while awaiting action from the Massachusetts state courts on his motion for a new trial; and ordering his removal to the Dominican Republic. While the respondent’s appeal was pending before the Board, the respondent filed a motion to reopen and remand this matter to the Immigration Court for further proceedings based on new, material, and previously unavailable evidence. The respondent’s request is premised on the claim that the conviction which forms the basis for the grounds of removal has been vacated. Specifically, the respondent has presented evidence that on November 23, 2010, the Milford District Court, Milford, Massachusetts, granted the respondent’s Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and Order a New Trial.¿FN1º We observe that the respondent’s motion was properly served on the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), and the DHS as yet has filed no opposition or other response to this motion, and the motion is deemed unopposed. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3).
 
The Board in Matter of Pickering, 23 I&N Dec. 621 (BIA 2003), rev’d on other grounds, Pickering v. Gonzales, 465 F.3d 263 (6th Cir. 2006), held that if a court vacates a conviction based upon a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings, there is no longer a conviction for immigration purposes. However, an alien remains convicted of a removable offense when the predicate conviction is vacated simply for rehabilitative purposes or to aid the alien in avoiding adverse immigration consequences and not because of any procedural or substantive defect in the original conviction. Id. at 624; see also Saleh v. Gonzales, 495 F.3d 17, 25 (2d Cir. 2007) (joining and citing to the decisions of the various circuits in support of the Board’s decision in Pickering that if a court vacates an alien’s criminal conviction solely on the basis of immigration hardships or rehabilitation, rather than on the basis of a substantive or procedural defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the conviction is not eliminated for immigration purposes and will continue to serve as a valid factual predicate for a charge of removability despite its vacatur); see also Matter of Chavez-Martinez, 24 I&N Dec. 272 (BIA 2007) (in order for immigration consequences to be eliminated, alien’s conviction cannot be vacated solely for immigration purposes).
 
*2 In the matter before us, however, it is clear that the criminal court judge’s ruling, granting the respondent’s Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and Order a New Trial, was based on a procedural and substantive defect in the plea entered by the respondent at his criminal trial. Specifically, the respondent maintains that he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel, and that his plea was not knowingly, voluntarily, or intelligently made, in violation of state and federal due process. See Henderson v. Morgan, 426 U.S. 637, 644-45 (1976); Commonwealth v. Foster, 368 Mass. 100, 102 (1975). Therefore, the Massachusetts criminal court’s action was premised upon what it perceived to be a procedural defect in the underlying proceedings, rather than some form of post-conviction relief. See Rumierz v. Gonzales, 456 F.3d 31, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2006) (a vacated conviction is no longer a “conviction” within the meaning of the immigration laws only “if a court with jurisdiction vacates ¿theº conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings.”); Herrera-Inirio v. INS, 208 F.3d 299 (1st Cir. 2000).
 
The question here is whether there is now a conviction for a “controlled substance” violation, or any conviction rendering the respondent not only removable but also precluding his eligibility for relief, or whether the proceedings should be terminated. Consequently, in view of the foregoing, the respondent’s motion will be granted, and the record will be remanded to Immigration Court for further proceedings, in order to enable the Immigration Judge to consider the new evidence offered by the respondent relating to his removability under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), and to determine whether the respondent can now establish his eligibility for relief from removal, or whether the proceedings should be terminated.
 
Accordingly, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion, and the entry of a new decision.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, and the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Adriana Gomez, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Andrew Brown
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on November 23, 2010, when the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his removal proceedings that were conducted in absentia on March 5, 2009. The Board determined, in part, that the respondent’s letter requesting a continuance of his hearing evidenced that the respondent received notice of his hearing. The Board also noted that although the respondent alleged that his former counsel was ineffective, he did not assert that his former counsel’s action or inaction resulted in the respondent missing his March 5, 2009, hearing. Rather, the respondent was only seeking to have his payments to his former counsel refunded. On December 6, 2010, the respondent, a native and citizen of Canada, filed a motion to reopen. The motion will be denied.
 
To the extent the respondent seeks reconsideration based on previously raised issues, he has not identified any error of fact or law in the Board’s previous detailed decision that would alter the outcome. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). Although the respondent claims that he never sent a letter requesting a continuance of his scheduled hearing, the record contains such a request bearing the respondent’s signature (Exh. 3). Further, the record reveals that notice of the respondent’s March 5, 2009, hearing that was scheduled to begin at 8:30 a.m., was properly mailed to the Deland, Florida address contained on the Notice to Appear, which is the same address that is listed on the change of address form that was submitted after both the Notice to Appear and Notice of Hearing were issued (Exhs. 1, 3, 5; Form EOIR-33/IC). The Form-EOIR-33/IC indicates that the respondent’s address changed from the Deland, Florida address to an Ontario, Canada address, which is the same address that is listed on the respondent’s request for a continuance and is consistent with the respondent’s former counsel’s statement indicating that the respondent had returned to Canada in or around January of 2009 (Compare Form EOIR-33/IC, with Exh. 3, and, Resp. Brief at Tab 8). The respondent does not dispute that he provided the Deland, Florida address. Indeed, he admits that he owns the property at the Deland, Florida address. Nor does he contend that the Notices never arrived at the Deland, Florida address. Rather, the respondent asserts only that “to the address in Deland he often loses the mail.” (Resp. Brief at 2).
 
*2 On this record, we do not find that the respondent has sufficiently demonstrated that the alleged action or inaction of his former counsel reasonably affected the respondent’s receipt of either the Notice to Appear or the Notice of Hearing. The respondent therefore has not demonstrated the required prejudice stemming from his former counsel’s alleged behavior. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
Finally, the respondent has not demonstrated that this case involves an exceptional situation for sua sponte reopening under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 1999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Nor has the respondent submitted or pointed to evidence demonstrating that reopening for further hearings is warranted. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion and related request for a stay of removal are denied.

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Stephen A. Johnston
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This matter was last before the Board on January 12, 2006, when we denied the respondent’s untimely filed motion to reopen. On May 10, 2010, the respondent filed another motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
With certain exceptions, an alien is entitled to file only one motion to reopen and the motion must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order of deportation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The final administrative order in this matter was entered on May 23, 2003. The respondent’s motion is both time-barred and number-barred. There is an exception for motions to reopen that seek to apply for asylum or withholding based on changed country conditions. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(H) (providing that the time and numerical limitations for motions to reopen do not apply to motions to apply for asylum or withholding based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or to which deportation has been ordered, if the respondent presents evidence that is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing). Additionally, anyone who seeks to reopen immigration proceedings bears the heavy burden of showing that if proceedings were reopened, the new evidence offered would likely change the result in the case. See Shin v. Mukasey, 547 F.3d 1019 (9th Cir. 2008); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-73 (BIA 1992).
 
The respondent contends that her current motion falls within the changed country conditions exception to the time and number requirements for motions to reopen. The respondent also claims that she received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorney who filed her prior motion to reopen.
 
First, the respondent has not established that her motion falls within the changed country conditions exception. She contends that a coup in 2006 in Fiji constitutes a changed condition since her hearing, which was in 2001. She further contends that conditions are deteriorating for ethnic Indians in Fiji (Mot. at 6-7). The respondent additionally asserts that she suffered past persecution while living in Fiji and that this occurred after the 1987 coup in that country (Mot. at 3) She also states that after another coup, in 2000, many Indian Fijians lost their property and were assaulted by the native Fijians, and that the police and the army refused to assist the Indian Fijians (Mot. at 3). To support her claim, the respondent has submitted her own statement, statements from persons in Fiji, and background evidence about Fiji.
 
*2 The respondent’s evidence does not establish changed country conditions but a continuation of conditions. The affidavit of Sajla Nand, for example, states that the conditions for Indo-Fijians have been problematic since the coup of 1987 (Exh. B). The State Department report reflects that “¿tºension between ethnic Fijians and Indo-Fijians has been a long-standing problem.” See United States Dep’t of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, 2009 Human Rights Reports: Fiji, 14 (Mar. 11, 2010) (Exh. D). The report does not reflect that conditions for Indo- Fijians have materially changed since 2001. Nor does any of the other evidence reflect a material change in conditions. Because the respondent has not established changed conditions in Fiji that are material to her eligibility for asylum or withholding, she has not shown that her motion comes within the exception to the filing requirements.
 
The respondent also asserts that her former attorney, Tsz-Hai Huang, provided ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, she states that Attorney Huang, whom she retained in 2005, failed to file a Form I-130 based on the respondent’s 2003 marriage, and also failed to inform the respondent that she was eligible to self-petition as the widow of a United States citizen after her husband died in 2006 (Mot. at 7-8). Aliens raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a motion may have the time limits on motions equitably tolled. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003). However, such tolling applies only when the alien was prevented from timely filing a motion by deception, fraud, or error, and only when the alien acted with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error. Id. Here, the respondent fails to explain in her current motion why she waited more than 4 years after the Board denied her first motion to reopen, on which her former attorney represented her, before filing the current motion. The respondent has not shown that equitable tolling applies.
 
In addition, the respondent has failed to comply with the requirements for ineffective assistance claims as set out in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). In Lozada, we held that such motions require: (1) that the motion be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard; (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel’s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. Id. at 639. It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640.
 
*3 As the DHS correctly contends, the respondent admits that she has not filed a complaint with the relevant state bar association (Mot. at 8), and there is no evidence that she has even informed Attorney Huang of her accusations. Accordingly, she has not substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, supra, and her motion is properly denied for that reason. See Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 525 (9th Cir. 2000) (motions to reopen alleging ineffective assistance can be in denied where Lozada requirements are not substantially met, as such requirements are reasonable in ordinary circumstances); see also Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 825 (9th Cir. 2003) (observing the importance of the disciplinary reporting requirement of Lozada). Furthermore, the respondent’s accusations against Attorney Huang are conclusory, and the respondent has not provided sufficient evidence to show she was, in fact, eligible for additional relief. Thus, she has not shown prejudice. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir. 2004) (substantial prejudice must be shown, meaning that the alleged ineffectiveness affected the outcome of the proceedings).
 
In summary, the respondent has not established that her motion falls within any exception to the filing requirements for motions to reopen. She has also not established that the time period for filing her motion should be equitably tolled. The respondent has not substantially complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, with respect to her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and she has not established prejudice based on her former attorney’s representation. Accordingly, the respondent has not established that reopening is warranted in this matter.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.

File: AXXX XX1 284 - New York, NY
December 28, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alfonso Ramos, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 On November 18, 2010, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen the Board’s August 18, 2010, decision dismissing his appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision finding him ineligible for relief from removal. Section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion will be denied.
 
In his motion the respondent alleges that his former attorney, Wayne Zhu, provided him with ineffective assistance as Mr. Zhu did not submit an application for withholding of removal before the Immigration Judge. He further states that he is seeking a pardon for the conviction forming the basis for the charges of removability (Exh. 1).
 
While the respondent has demonstrated that he submitted a complaint with the bar authorities against Mr. Zhu, he has not otherwise complied with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 126-27 (2d Cir. 2000). For example, there is no evidence that he notified Mr. Zhu of the allegations against him, nor has he provided an affidavit setting forth “in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken,” as well as any representations made by counsel.
 
In addition, the respondent has not shown that he was prejudiced by counsel’s alleged ineffective assistance, i.e., that had the application been filed, the result would have been different. Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006); Esposito v. INS, 987 F.2d 108, 111 (2d Cir. 1993). The asylum application submitted with the motion is incomplete. It fails to identify any reason why the respondent is seeking such relief, and provides no narrative explanations of what harm he allegedly fears, at whose hands, and on what basis.¿FN1º Given this record, reopening is not warranted, and his motion is not exempt from the time-bar on motions to reopen.
 
We recognize that the respondent appears to be pursuing a Governor’s pardon of the criminal conviction at issue. However, the fact that the respondent may be pursuing post-conviction relief in the form of a pardon does not affect the finality of his conviction for immigration purposes. Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996); Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992). He has presented no evidence showing that the pardon has been granted, or that he has any likelihood of success in this regard. Therefore, reopening in this regard is not appropriate. Further, we do not find that the filing of the respondent’s pardon request constitutes exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of our discretionary authority to reopen proceedings sua sponte. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied as untimely.

While we recognize that respondent’s counsel has made allegations in this regard in the motion to reopen, we note that statements of counsel contained in a motion are not competent evidence of the facts alleged, and thus are not entitled to any evidentiary weight. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503 (BIA 1980); see also INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188-89 n.6 (1984).

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Hungary, adjusted her status to lawful permanent resident on April 29, 1991, retroactive to April 11, 1989, the date on which she was granted conditional status. On June 28, 1996, the respondent was convicted of commercial burglary and grand theft in violation of sections 459, 460(b), and 487(a) of the California Penal Code (Exh. 1, 1A). A Notice to Appear was issued on December 11, 1997, but was not filed until April 1, 2003. On June 10, 2004, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged, and ordered her removed to Hungary. The respondent appealed the removal order but then withdrew her appeal (BIA, dated September 28, 2004, at 1).
 
On August 5, 2010, the respondent filed a motion styled “Respondent Request to Review Her Removal Proceedings and Her Appeal.” The respondent argued that the removal order was incorrect because at the time she was convicted, the offenses of burglary and grand theft were not aggravated felonies. The Immigration Judge construed the motion as a motion to reopen, and on September 3, 2010, denied the motion as untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (2010). The respondent now appeals. The respondent’s request for a waiver of the appellate filing fee is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). The appeal will be dismissed.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that her counsel during the removal proceedings was ineffective (DHS Br. filed September 2, 2010, at 2; Form EOIR-26, attached statement at 1). As the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) points out the respondent did not raise this argument in her motion before the Immigration Judge (DHS Br. at 2). She cannot argue for the first time on appeal that her counsel during the 2004 removal proceedings was ineffective (DHS Br. at 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(b) (providing that the statement of the basis of appeal must “specifically identify the findings of fact, the conclusions of law, or both, that are being challenged”).
 
*2 Additionally, the respondent has not presented evidence of her compliance with any of the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1998) (DHS Br. at 2-3, 4). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly, and J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). In Matter of Lozada, supra, we stated that a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel requires that (1) the motion be supported by an affidavit of the applicant setting forth in detail the agreement between the applicant and her legal representative and what actions were to be taken on her behalf; (2) the counsel whose reputation is being impugned be informed of the allegations against him or her and be given an opportunity to respond; and (3) the motion reflect whether a complaint had been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities, and if not, why not. The record does not contain any of the required documentation.
 
Furthermore, the allegations made regarding ineffective assistance of counsel appear disingenuous. For example, the respondent alleges that her prior counsel did not inform her of, or bring her to, her final removal hearing (Form EOIR-26, attached statement at 1). The record indicates that the respondent was present on June 10, 2004, when the Immigration Judge ordered her removed to Hungary (Form EOIR-26, attached statement at 1; Tr. at 7-22).¿FN1º
 
The respondent also suggests that prior counsel did not inform her that she was eligible for relief from removal under INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001) (Form EOIR-26, attached statement at 1). The argument is not persuasive. The transcript reveals that at the June 10, 2004, hearing, prior counsel raised the issue of whether the respondent was eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section 212(c) pursuant to INS v. St. Cyr, supra (Tr. at 18).
 
More importantly, INS v. St. Cyr, supra, does not help the respondent (DHS Br. filed November 5, 2010, at 4-6; DHS Br. filed September 2, 2010, at 2-3). In INS v. St. Cyr, supra, the Supreme Court held that the restrictions on section 212(c) relief do not apply retroactively to an alien who pled guilty before April 24, 1996, the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”). The respondent was convicted after a bench trial,¿FN2º and the convictions were sustained on June 28, 1996, 2 months after the AEDPA’s effective date (DHS Br. filed November 5, 2010, at 4-6; Respondent’s Br. filed September 20, 2010, at 4;Tr. at 12, 17; Exh. 1, 1A). See INS v. Velasco-Medina, 305 F.3d 839, 849-850 (9th Cir. 2002) (explaining that relief under former section 212(c) was unavailable for an alien who was convicted after the AEDPA’s date of enactment); Kelava v. Gonzales, 434 F.3d 1120, 1124-25 (9th Cir. 2006); Armendariz-Montoya v. Sonchik, 291 F.3d 1116, 1121 (9th Cir. 2002). Therefore, because the respondent cannot rely on INS v. St Cyr for relief, she cannot persuasively claim ineffective assistance of counsel based on misapplication of the law (DHS Br. filed November 5, 2010, at 4-6; DHS Br. filed September 2, 2010, at 2-3).
 
*3 The respondent argued in her motion, and again on appeal, that she is eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), because her 1996 burglary and grand theft convictions predated the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”), and were not considered aggravated felonies at the time the convictions were entered (Respondent’s Br. filed September 20, 2010, at 2). She states that the offenses were not aggravated felonies because the term of imprisonment imposed was 4 years, and at the time, the definition of aggravated felony required the imposed term of imprisonment to be at least 5 years (Respondent’s Br. filed September 20, 2010, at 2; Respondent Request to Review Her Removal Proceedings and Her Appeal at 4).¿FN3º Congress, however, expressly stated that IIRIRA’s amendments to the definition of “aggravated felony” apply retroactively. See Pub. L. 104-208, § 321 (c), 110 Stat. 3009 (“The amendments made by this section shall apply to actions taken on or after the day of the enactment of this Act ¿September 30, 1996º, regardless of when the conviction occurred ….”). See also Alvarez-Barajas v. Gonzales, 418 F.3d 1050, 1054-55 (9th Cir. 2005); Matter of Yeung, 21 I&N Dec. 610, 614 (1997) (stating “¿aºny presumption against retroactivity cannot apply where Congress has clearly stated that a statute is to be applied retroactively.”). Having been convicted of an aggravated felony, the respondent is not eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). For this reason, she cannot claim that her prior counsel was ineffective in not pursuing relief under section 212(h).
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The respondent states that her final hearing was on October 12, 2004, but the record indicates that the hearing proceedings were closed on June 10, 2004 (Tr. at 22).

2

The respondent concedes that under Ninth Circuit precedent she is not eligible for relief under former section 212(c) because her 1996 convictions resulted from a trial (Respondent’s Br. filed September 20, 2010, at 4).

3

The respondent does not otherwise dispute that her burglary and grand theft convictions are aggravated felonies under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Brian G. McDonnell
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 On November 10, 2010, the respondent submitted an untimely Notice of Appeal with respect to the Immigration Judge’s April 22, 2010, decision denying a motion to reopen. A Notice of Appeal was due to be filed no later than May 24, 2010. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b) (Notice of Appeal shall be filed within 30 days after the stating of an Immigration Judge’s oral decision or the mailing of an Immigration Judge’s written decision); Matter of Liadov, 23 I&N Dec. 990 (BIA 2006). As the respondent’s Notice of Appeal was not filed until months after that date, the appeal is untimely. Failure to file a timely appeal divests this Board of jurisdiction.
 
To the extent that the respondent now avers he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel by his criminal defense attorney who did not notify him of the collateral consequences of his criminal plea, this aspect of his submission is in the nature of a motion to reopen. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). However, it is untimely as it was filed more than a year after the Immigration Judge’s final administrative decision, and he has not provided any evidence substantiating this claim. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). To the extent that the respondent suggests that his criminal conviction is untenable in light of the holding in Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), we note that this decision does not change the finality of his conviction for immigration purposes, unless and until it is overturned by a criminal court. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996). Therefore, reopening on this basis is not warranted. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
In sum, the Immigration Judge’s decision is final, and the records are returned to the Immigration Court without further action. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.3(a), 1003.38, 1003.39, 1240.14 and 1240.15.

*1 The Board issued an administratively final removal order in this case on June 15, 2006. The respondent’s three prior motions have been denied. On August 2, 2010, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen. The respondent reasserts his prior ineffective assistance claim against the counsel who represented him on appeal and against the counsel who represented him before the Immigration Judge.
 
We will not address the respondent’s claim that he received ineffective assistance from counsel Anthony D. Collins at his hearings before the Immigration Judge beyond commenting that there is no evidence in the record that Mr. Collins represented the respondent in these proceedings. In fact, contrary to the respondent’s declaration, the counsel who appeared on his behalf at his last immigration hearing was Alec J. Niziolek, Esquire, who is not mentioned at all in the motion (I.J. at 1; Tr. at 1, 5).¿FN1º The fact that Mr. Niziolek was affiliated with Mr. Collins’ law firm does not create an ineffective assistance claim against Mr. Collins absent specific evidence that Collins performed a direct role in the case that unfairly prejudiced its outcome. Individual attorneys, not law firms or other associations, must enter their appearances in cases before the Executive Office for Immigration Review and are individually accountable for their actions. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.17, 1003.101 et seq.
 
With respect to the respondent’s argument that he received ineffective assistance from his appellate counsel, M. Najmul Alam, warranting reopening of his proceedings or, alternatively, reissuance of the June 15, 2006, decision dismissing his appeal, we note that our last two decisions rejected his ineffective assistance claim against Mr. Alam for failure to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent has belatedly complied with the procedural steps, including the requirement that he notify the accused counsel and provide him an opportunity to respond. However, Mr. Alam’s response forcefully denies the respondent’s claims and states that he zealously represented the respondent on his appeal, timely notified the respondent of the Board’s decision and his options to seek further administrative or judicial review. According to Mr. Alam, the respondent then informed him that he did not wish him to perform any further services in his immigration case (MTR, Tab F). We find Mr. Alam’s response more persuasive than the respondent’s declaration, particularly in light of the material inaccuracies in the same declaration regarding Mr. Collins’ role in his case.¿FN2º
 
*2 Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the respondent has demonstrated a basis to equitably toll the general restrictions on motions and deny the motion as time and number-barred. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). See Iavorski v. United States INS, 232 F.3d 124, 129-135 (2d Cir. 2000)(aliens relying on equitable tolling must establish that their constitutional right to due process was violated by counsel’s conduct and that they exercised due diligence during the period sought to be tolled). See also Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 130-32 (2d Cir. 2008) (an alien is required to exercise due diligence both before and after he has or should have discovered ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
ORDER: The motion is denied.

The record further reflects that an accredited representative, Olga Rog, represented the respondent before the immigration court on September 23, 2004, and that she withdrew from the case prior to the January 6, 2005, hearing where Mr. Niziolek appeared (Tr. at 5; Exh. 3).

2

The respondent’s arguments that his friend, Rashid, ineffectively assisted him are too vague to constitute a colorable claim, particularly since it does not appear that he attempted to assist the respondent until more than a year after his appeal was dismissed and that his assistance was principally related to the visa petition proceedings.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Kenneth Panzer, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent’s motion is untimely filed and number-barred and has not been shown to qualify for any exception to the filing requirements imposed on motions to reopen removal proceedings. See sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i), of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).¿FN1º Similarly, the respondent’s request for reopening to pursue her application for adjustment of status based on a pending Form I-360 petition as an abused spouse of a United States citizen, is untimely. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv) of the Act. That section contains a special rule for battered spouses which provides an exception to the motions’ deadlines. The applicable deadline can be waived where someone wishes to self-petition for adjustment of status as an abused spouse of a United States citizen, has provided a copy of the petition, and files the motion within one year of the entry of the final order of removal. This time limitation can be waived in the exercise of discretion if an alien can demonstrate extraordinary circumstances or extreme hardship to a child. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv) of the Act.
 
The record reflects the Board entered a final order of removal on April 6, 2004. However, the instant motion was not filed until June 1, 2010. In this instance, in order to apply the statutory exception found in section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv) of the Act to the filing deadline, the motion had to have been submitted within one year of the entry of the final order of removal. As noted above, the record reflects that more than 6 years have passed since the Board entered its final order of removal and the respondent filed the instant motion. Furthermore, in order to waive this time limitation, the respondent must demonstrate extraordinary circumstances or extreme hardship to her child. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(iv)(III) of the Act. Despite her pending petition, the respondent has presented no evidence as to any extraordinary circumstances or extreme hardship to a child, to cause us to exercise favorable discretion in this instance.
 
Finally, the respondent has not demonstrated that this case involves an exceptional situation for sua sponte reopening under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). See also Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132 (BIA 999); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). On this record, the respondent has provided us with no reason to overlook the fact that her motion is untimely and number-barred. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion and related request for a stay of removal are denied.

By motion filed on November 18, 2010, the respondent withdrew her asserted ineffective assistance of counsel claim. However, to the extent the respondent continues to claim ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent has not sufficiently shown patent error or prejudice.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hilario Mercado, Jr., Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador and lawful permanent resident of the United States, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 16, 2010, which found that she was removable as charged. While the appeal was pending, the respondent filed an Emergency Motion to Terminate Removal Proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion. The motion will be granted and proceedings terminated.
 
The DHS served the respondent with a Notice to Appear that alleged that she had been convicted on April 2, 2009, in Virginia of misdemeanor embezzlement, for which she was sentenced to 12 months incarceration, 8 months suspended, and charged that she was removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) (convicted of crime involving moral turpitude). On appeal, the respondent provided a November 23, 2010, order showing that the State court vacated the respondent’s April 2, 2009, conviction based on the finding that the respondent had established that her attorney’s failure to advise her of the immigration consequences of her guilty plea constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. We agree with the respondent that her conviction is no longer valid for immigration purposes. Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878, 879 (BIA 2006). There is no other factual allegation or charge of removability lodged against the respondent. Therefore, we find that the respondent is no longer removable from the United States. Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is granted, the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 16, 2010, is vacated, and removal proceedings are terminated.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Amy E. Greene
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The respondents, a married couple who are natives and citizens of the Philippines, move this Board to reconsider our June 29, 2010, final decision.¿FN1º 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). In that decision, we dismissed the appeal of the Immigration Judge’s January 30, 2009, decision denying adjustment of status. Section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion. The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent entered the United States as a non-immigrant visitor on July 3, 2003, with authority to remain until July 1, 2004. She filed a valid Form I-140 and an Application for Adjustment of Status (Form I-485) with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) on May 28, 2004. Ultimately, the application for adjustment was denied on October 20, 2005, because the respondent failed to provide the required certificate pursuant to section 212 (a)(5(C) of the Act (an alien seeking entry to perform labor as a health-care worker other than a physician must present a certificate from the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools or equivalent in order to be admissible). See also section 245(a) of the Act. The respondent filed a second Form I-485 with the USCIS on December 5, 2005. On October 17, 2007, this application was denied because the respondent had not maintained valid non-immigrant status since her last entry as required by section 245(c) of the Act, and she did not qualify for an exception because she had been out of status since July 1, 2004, well beyond the 180 day excepted period under section 245(k) of the Act. See also Matter of L-K-, 23 I&N Dec. 677 (BIA 2004).
 
A motion to reconsider a decision of the Board must include, in relevant part, the following: (1) an allegation of material factual or legal errors in the prior decision that is supported by pertinent authority; and (2) if there has been a change in law, a reference to the relevant statute, regulation, or precedent and an explanation of how the outcome of the Board’s decision is materially affected by the change. See Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). This motion argues essentially that the respondents were in the United States within a period of authorized stay while the applications for adjustment of status were pending, and therefore the respondents had not been out of status for over 180 days when they filed their second application for adjustment of status.
 
*2 However, where a first application is denied and a second adjustment application is filed, the period after which the nonimmigrant status expired and during which the first adjustment of status application was pending counts against the 180-day period. See USCIS HQDOMO 70/23.1-P AD06-07 memorandum on Applicability of Section 245(k) to certain Employment-Based Adjustment of Status Application under section 245(a) of the Act. The period that the respondent was out of status began on July 1, 2004, and continued until she filed the second Form I-485 on October 17, 2007, over three years. Therefore, the period the respondent was out of status far exceeded the allowable 180 days. The motion essentially disagrees with our conclusion, but does not demonstrate any errors of law or fact in our prior decision that would warrant reconsideration.¿FN2º Accordingly, the following order will be entered.¿FN3º
 
ORDER: The motion for reconsideration is denied.

The female respondent (AXXX XXX XXX) is the lead respondent. Her husband applied for adjustment of status as a derivative beneficiary. References to the “respondent” will be to the lead respondent.

2

Insofar as the respondents argue that the unlawful presence accrued because of the mishandling of their case by their prior lawyer, this would be a motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel and should be supported by evidence. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). No evidence has been proffered in support of this argument.

The respondents filed this motion within the 60 day voluntary departure period granted by the Board. Consequently, the grant of voluntary departure was automatically terminated, and the penalties for failure to depart voluntarily do not apply. See section 240B(d) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(3)(iii); see also generally Dada v. Mukasey, 128 S.Ct. 2307, 2309 (2008).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se¿FN1º
 
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 The final administrative order was entered by this Board on December 28, 2009. Thereafter, in a decision dated August 19, 2010, the Board denied the respondent’s motion to reconsider. On October 15, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reopen. With certain exceptions not pertinent here, the respondent is limited to one motion to reopen and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent’s motion to reopen is therefore barred by the time limitations applicable to motions. Furthermore, to the extent the respondent seeks reconsideration of the Board’s August 19, 2010, decision denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider, the respondent’s motion is barred by regulation. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(2). Nonetheless, to the extent the respondent’s motion rests on previously raised issues related to the alleged ineffective assistance of his first counsel, Irene M. Recio, the respondent has not identified any error of fact or law in the Board’s previous detailed decision that would alter the outcome. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider).
 
Moreover, notwithstanding the respondent’s alleged “confusion” over the date of his scheduled hearing, the respondent does not dispute that the Immigration Judge personally advised the respondent that he was required to appear on September 3, 2008, for his next scheduled hearing. Nor does the respondent specifically aver either that he was unable to understand the Immigration Judge’s direction or that his first counsel, Irene M. Recio, failed to advise the respondent that he must appear as directed. That the respondent apparently believed that he also had a hearing scheduled in April of 2008, does not alone support the respondent’s assertion that his first counsel never properly advised him that he was required to appear for his September 3, 2008, scheduled hearing, particularly in light of the respondent’s first counsel’s assertion that she did, in fact, advise the respondent that he was required to appear as scheduled. Under the circumstances, we do not find that the respondent has sufficiently demonstrated the required prejudice stemming from his second counsel’s, John D. Lee, alleged action or inaction on the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim against the respondent’s first counsel, Irene M. Recio. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
*2 On this record, the respondent has provided us with no adequate reason to overlook the untimeliness of his motion. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony (as defined in section 101(a)(43)(B))
  
APPLICATION: Termination
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s August 11, 2010, decision finding him removable from the United States, as charged. The appeal will be sustained and removal proceedings terminated.
 
The respondent is a 28-year-old native and citizen of the Dominican Republic who entered the United States on February 16, 1996, as a lawful permanent resident. The respondent was convicted in the Chelsea District Court, Chelsea, Massachusetts, on June 2, 2005, of distribution of a controlled substance (cocaine) in violation of Chapter 94C, Section 32A(a) of the Massachusetts General Laws. He was sentenced to 1 year in the House of Correction. He maintained the Immigration Judge should have granted him a continuance to have his conviction vacated under Padilla v. Kentucky, ___ U.S. ___, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010). The respondent claims ineffective assistance of counsel in that he allegedly was not informed of the immigration consequences of his conviction. See Padilla v. Kentucky, supra (counsel may provide ineffective assistance to a criminal defendant by failing to advise him of the possibility of deportation as the result of a guilty plea).
 
The respondent states the Immigration Judge erred because he did not grant him a continuance until the Massachusetts State court decided his motion to vacate his conviction. The Immigration Judge declined to grant him a continuance. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. On appeal he has shown that his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and vacate the judgment of conviction was granted by the Chelsea District Court on September 15, 2010. He has requested termination of proceedings or a remand for the Immigration Judge to terminate proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded. As the respondent’s conviction is no longer final, removal proceedings must be terminated.
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained; removal proceedings are terminated.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Peter L. Ashman, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Peter Eitel
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent is a citizen of Guatemala and a lawful permanent resident of the United States. On August 26, 2010, he was ordered removed from the United States in absentia after failing to appear at a hearing. The respondent filed a motion to reopen on September 22, 2010. The Immigration Judge denied it on October 12, 2010, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be sustained.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent argues on appeal that his failure to appear at the hearing was caused by “exceptional circumstances.” He asserts that his former counsel was ineffective by not notifying him of his hearing. The Board need not resolve whether the respondent’s failure to appear at his hearing was caused by ineffective assistance of counsel because we will reopen these proceedings sua sponte.
 
In Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997), we held that the Board’s and the Immigration Judge’s power to reopen or reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional situations and is not meant to cure filing defects or circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship. Herein, we consider that the respondent has resided in the United States as a lawful permanent resident since 1983. He further appears to have been eligible to apply at his hearing for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The respondent additionally indicates in his affidavit that his mother, grandmother, and three siblings are United States citizens. He further states that he has been involved in a romantic relationship for seven years with a citizen of this country. Thus, the respondent appears to lack any motivation to avoid his hearing and abandon his opportunity to remain in the United States as a lawful permanent resident.
 
We further observe that the respondent appears to have been diligent regarding maintaining his immigration status in the United States. He hired an attorney to represent him before the Immigration Court, and states that he traveled from Las Vegas to an earlier hearing at Houston, Texas, prior to venue being changed. We further note the respondent’s assertions in his affidavit alleging that he diligently maintained contact with his former attorney regarding his obligation to appear for a hearing before the Immigration Court. He also filed his motion to reopen less than a month after being ordered removed from the United States in absentia.
 
*2 In addition, the Board has not overlooked that the respondent was notified of his hearing. It is undisputed that the respondent’s Notice of Hearing was received by the respondent’s former attorney. In addition, we note that both the respondent’s former attorney and the Immigration Court mailed a copy of the Notice of Hearing to the address that the respondent acknowledges in his affidavit to be his correct address. The respondent’s claim to have not received either notice is therefore questionable.
 
Notwithstanding, we will in the exercise of discretion reopen these proceedings sua sponte to allow the respondent an opportunity for a hearing. We accord significant weight in this determination to the respondent’s lengthy period in the United States as a lawful permanent resident. We also accord substantial weight to his diligence in filing his motion to reopen and his lack of incentive to avoid his hearing.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and these proceedings are reopened and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Thomas J. Tarigo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 6, 2009. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen proceedings. On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that he did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel at his prior hearing. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462,464-65 (BIA2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&NDec. 493 (BIA2008).
 
Initially, we note that the respondent’s September 17, 2009, motion to reopen is untimely, inasmuch as the respondent failed to file his motion to reopen within 90 days of the Immigration Judge’s October 12, 2004, decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). Furthermore, while we recognize that the respondent has complied with the requirements outlined by the Board in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), we find that the respondent has failed to establish that his former counsel provided ineffective assistance. An attorney’s tactical decisions in the preparation and presentation of an alien’s case do not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel See Magallanes-Damian v. INS, 783 F.2d 931, 934 (9th Cir. 1986). Respondent’s counsel advised the respondent to accept pre-conclusion voluntary departure, given the unlikelihood that the respondent would be granted cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act with his extensive criminal history, including convictions for petty theft, possession of a controlled substance, grand theft, spousal battery, vandalism, and inflicting corporal injury on a spouse. Under these circumstances, we find that the respondent has not demonstrated that reopening is warranted in this matter. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines, appeals the Immigration Judge’s December 23, 2009, decision denying her motion to reopen her deportation proceedings following the Immigration Judge’s November 20, 2009, order granting the respondent voluntary departure.¿FN1º See section 240B of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review findings of fact, including credibility determinations, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not satisfy the threshold requirements to establish ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (I.J. at 2-3). Although the respondent submitted a detailed letter of complaint addressed to her former counsel and a complaint form submitted to the disciplinary board of the State Bar of California, she did not submit an affidavit (I.J. at 2). Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639. The Lozada requirements are not “rigidly” enforced by the United States Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit, but the Court has “never excused a petitioner’s failure to provide an affidavit where, as here, the facts underlying the petitioner’s claim were not ‘plain on the face of the administrative record.”’ Reyes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 592, 597 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal citation omitted). Because the record does not show “a clear and obvious case” of ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent was not excused from meeting the formal requirements of Lozada. Castillo- Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518, 526 (9th Cir. 2000) (excusing compliance with Lozada where prior counsel did not timely file applications for relief but told the alien that the applications had been filed and the alien would have been prima facie eligible for relief).
 
Even if the respondent had substantially complied with the Lozada procedural factors, she did not establish that she suffered prejudice as a result of her former counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness. Matter of Lozada, supra, at 640; see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). First, the respondent claims that her former counsel improperly advised her to file a Form I-485 (Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status) and that the denial of the Form I-485 led to her placement in removal proceedings (Respondent’s Br. at 7-8, 10). The respondent has not established, however, that these actions of her former counsel made the removal proceedings themselves unfair. See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 968, 974 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting that “¿rºemoval proceedings do not become constitutionally unfair simply because they are precipitated in part by an attorney’s advice instead of general INS delay, or because the illegal alien might believe that he could avoid detection until eligible for another form of relief”), amended on other grounds by 404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir. 2005).
 
*2 Second, the respondent claims to have suffered prejudice because her former counsel did not inform the Immigration Judge of the respondent’s efforts to dissolve her current marriage and marry her United States citizen boyfriend. The Immigration Judge, however, indicated that he would not have granted a continuance on that basis (I.J. at 3). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.29; Matter of Sibrun, 18 I&N Dec. 354, 356 (BIA 1983). Moreover, as the Immigration Judge found and the respondent admits on appeal, voluntary departure was the only relief available to the respondent at the time of the hearing (I.J. at 3; Respondent’s Br. at 8). The respondent has not demonstrated that her former counsel’s failure to inform the Immigration Judge of the respondent’s marital plans may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. See Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785 (9th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, we find no error in the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alina Cruz, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider our decision dated March 19, 2010. To the extent that the respondent argues that we erred in finding that the respondent first raised her ineffective assistance claim while her case was before us on her appeal from the Immigration Judge’s March 26, 2008, decision, we acknowledge that such a claim was raised prior to our May 3, 2007, decision remanding the record to the Immigration Judge for a new decision. However, we find no error in our determination that she did demonstrate that she suffered prejudice as a result of ineffective assistance. Our last order addressed her arguments, made with the assistance of her new counsel, regarding her eligibility for adjustment under the Cuban Adjustment Act or a family member visa petition in our last order. The respondent does not allege error with respect to our determination that she is not eligible for adjustment under the Cuban Adjustment Act and we remain unpersuaded by her renewed arguments in the motion that she is eligible to adjust her status based on a family visa petition. We also note that the materials in the record pertaining to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim indicate that the respondent did not retain the attorney against whom her ineffective assistance claim is alleged until February 2005, well after the Board affirmed, in the separate visa petition proceedings, the district director’s denial of the petition filed by her present husband based on a finding that the section 204(c) bar applies. She may not relitigate the visa petition denial in the removal proceedings. Further, the respondent has not provided any controlling case law holding that a section 212(i) waiver is available in the circumstances presented here. Her continued reliance on Virk v. INS, 295 F.3d 1055 (9th Cir. 2002), is unavailing. The respondent’s proceedings fall within the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, not the Ninth. Further, that case concerned an alien who had been admitted as a lawful permanent resident and was seeking a waiver of removability under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H), and is inapposite. Accordingly, we deny the motion to reconsider.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eduardo Lachica Encinas, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Rubab Z. Razvi
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of Mexico, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on April 27, 2001, after failing to appear at a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on October 8, 2009. The Immigration Judge denied it on January 6, 2010, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The Immigration Judge determined that she lacked jurisdiction to reopen these proceedings. According to the Immigration Judge, the respondent was earlier removed from the United States, and the government reinstated the prior order of removal on December 15, 2008, when the respondent attempted to reenter the United States (I.J. at 3). The Immigration Judge thus determined that she did not have jurisdiction to reopen these proceedings.
 
The respondent does not contest on appeal the Immigration Judge’s factual finding that the respondent was removed from the United States, and the government had reinstated the prior removal order. The record also contains documentation corroborating the prior removal and reinstatement. See Lin v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2007). The respondent further does not specifically address the Immigration Judge’s determination that she lacked jurisdiction to reopen the proceedings. Instead, the respondent argues that “exceptional circumstances” prevented him from appearing at his hearing. He asserts that his former counsel instructed him not to appear because the case would be rescheduled. He claims that his failure to appear at his hearing was caused by ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
In Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008), the Board held that it and the Immigration Judge lacked authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d) to reopen removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings—whether on motion of an alien or sua sponte—if the alien has departed the United States after those administrative proceedings have been completed. However, the Board later held that an alien’s departure from the United States while under an outstanding order of deportation or removal issued in absentia does not deprive the Immigration Judge of jurisdiction to entertain a motion to reopen to rescind the order if the motion is premised upon lack of notice. See Matter of Bulnes, 25 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 2009).
 
*2 Herein, the respondent admits receiving notice of the hearing. The respondent’s claim for reopening made subsequent to removal based on “exceptional circumstances” does not fall within the scope of Matter of Bulnes, supra. We therefore agree with the Immigration Judge that she lacked jurisdiction to reopen these proceedings.
 
The Immigration Judge additionally found that the respondent did not establish “exceptional circumstances” warranting reopening even assuming that she had jurisdiction to grant the motion. There is no dispute that the motion is untimely because it was filed more than 180 days after the removal order. See section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C). The Immigration Judge also declined to equitably toll the 180-day period for seeking reopening.
 
The Immigration Judge mentioned several reasons for denying equitable tolling of the reopening period. Most significant to the Board is the lack of due diligence exercised by the respondent. According to the respondent’s affidavit, he learned on May 1, 2001, that he was ordered removed from the United States in absentia. The respondent states that his former attorney assured him that he would rectify the situation. He additionally states in his affidavit that he “from time to time” called his former attorney after 2001 to ascertain the progress of the effort to have his case reopened. The respondent provides scant detail regarding the frequency of his inquiries. He states that he was finally told on January 5, 2009, that his former counsel did not file the motion to reopen.
 
The respondent did not exercise due diligence in maintaining his immigration status during the many years that elapsed between his order of removal and January 5, 2009. That period of inaction is excessive. See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 F.3d 1218 (9th Cir. 2002). We will not equitably toll the period for seeking reopening until January 5, 2009. The respondent’s motion would nevertheless be untimely even if the Board found it appropriate to equitably toll the 180-day period to January 5, 2009. As mentioned, the respondent filed his motion to reopen on October 8, 2009, more than ten months after allegedly learning that his former counsel did not file a motion to reopen on his behalf. That additional delay is another reason for finding that due diligence was not exercised herein. The respondent may have been a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, it was incumbent on him to diligently raise the issue with the Immigration Judge. He did not do so. The Immigration Judge’s decision is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Belinda Arroyo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 9, 2010, finding him removable from the United States and pretermitting him from cancellation of removal consideration. On November 8, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to remand based on evidence that a Texas District Court had vacated his conviction serving as the basis for his removal from the United States. The criminal court determined that the respondent was a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel in that proceeding. See Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. We will grant the motion to remand. The issues on appeal relating to termination of proceedings shall be addressed on remand.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to remand is granted and proceedings are remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, who remained in the United States without authorization, has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated July 15, 2010.¿FN1º The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable and found him ineligible for relief from removal.
 
This Board reviews an Immigration Judge’ findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). This Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues raised in an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.l(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent has been in removal proceedings since April 2009. He married a United States citizen on August 27, 2009, and they have a child in common. Because of her citizenship, the respondent’s wife could have, at any time since they married, file a visa petition (Form I-130) on his behalf. At the hearing below, the respondent was represented by Accredited Representative Reverend Robert Vitaglione. The Accredited Representative requested, and was granted, continuances to enable the respondent’s wife to file the visa petition on the respondent’s behalf. At the final hearing, on July 15, 2010, the Accredited Representative advised the Immigration Judge that the respondent had told him that the respondent’s wife had failed to file a visa petition on his behalf because she lacked the funds. See Tr. at 45-46. Based on that, the Immigration Judge found the relief abandoned, found the respondent removable, and ordered the respondent removed. See Tr. at 47-48.
 
On appeal, the respondent claims that it is the Accredited Representative’s fault that the visa petition was never filed. First, we note that the respondent was present when the Accredited Representative told the Immigration Judge that the respondent had told him that the visa petition had not been filed because the respondent’s wife lacked the funds. And the respondent did not object at the time and tell the Immigration Judge that the Accredited representative’s statement was not true. See Tr. at 46.
 
Moreover, the respondent has not fulfilled the prerequisites for allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 472 (BIA 1996); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The respondent has not shown evidence that he has notified the former Accredited Representative of the allegation of ineffective assistance, enabling the former Accredited Representative to respond to the allegations. See Matter of Grijalva, supra; Matter of Lozada, supra.
 
*2 We also note that the respondent does not indicate on appeal that his United States citizen wife has, since the hearing, filed a visa petition on his behalf.
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note that the Immigration Judge’s Order indicates that the respondent waived appeal. However, the hearing transcript reflects that the respondent indicated a desire to appeal the decision. See Tr. at 49. We also note that the respondent’s appeal was untimely. It was due on August 16, 2010, but was not received at this Board until August 20, 2010. Because the respondent is pro se, and because of the confusion wrought by the Immigration Judge’s order, we will take this appeal on certification. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c).

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Maria Baldini-Potermin, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Mirta J. Woodall
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen the Board’s June 9, 2010, decision summarily dismissing his appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying his application for cancellation of removal. He also seeks a stay of removal. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion. The motion and stay request are granted, and the record remanded.
 
The respondent claims in his motion that his former representative, Mr. McGonnagle, provided him with ineffective assistance by failing to submit relevant evidence relating to his positive equities and the associated decision whether a discretionary grant relief was warranted. He further alleges error in that former counsel’s failure to provide any reasons or bases for the appeal in either the Notice of Appeal or an appeal brief resulted in a summary dismissal. Mr. McGonnagle also reportedly erred by advising the respondent to plead guilty regarding a controlled substance charge despite his claim that he did not commit the offense. He contends these errors prejudiced him by preventing his claim from being fully presented, causing him to accept a criminal plea that adversely affected his immigration case, and resulting in the denial of his application for cancellation.
 
The record reflects that the respondent has complied with the procedural requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and has shown that Mr. McGonnagle’s actions caused him prejudice. Surganova v. Holder, 612 F.3d 901, 907 (7th Cir. 2010); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Not only has the respondent shown that a bar complaint has been filed against former counsel with appropriate notice given, but he has also filed a receipt of the same from the bar authority (Tabs A, B; Suppl. Tab B). No response has been received from Mr. McGonnagle. The respondent has also shown that a post-conviction petition regarding the controlled substance offense has been filed. Given this record, we find it appropriate to grant the respondent’s motion and request for a stay of removal. The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further consideration.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Chunyu Jean Wang, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
 
Sec. 237(a)(1)(C)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(C)(i)º - Nonimmigrant - violated conditions of status
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge’s August 26, 2010, decision to deny his untimely motion to reopen. On October 17, 2003, the final administrative order in the respondent’s removal proceeding was entered by the Immigration Judge. On August 3, 2010, the respondent filed a motion to reopen claiming ineffective assistance of counsel and new relief. On August 26, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied his motion finding the respondent failed to timely file, did not comply with proper ineffective assistance of counsel requirements, did not show due diligence.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that the prior Immigration Judge was biased and hostile towards his case. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
“¿Aº party may file only one motion to reopen deportation or exclusion proceedings (whether before the Board of the Immigration Judge) and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent did not file his motion to reopen within 90 days of the final administrative decision, nor did he file it on or before September 30, 1996. As noted by the Immigration Judge, the respondent filed his motion approximately 6-years late (I.J. at 2). As such, we agree with the Immigration Judge that his motion to reopen the final administrative order is time-barred. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).
 
The 90-day filing deadline may be equitably tolled when the motion to reopen is based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Zhao v. INS, 452 F.3d 154 (2d Cir. 2006). The respondent has argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and has complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). In order to prevail on such a motion the movant must show that he exercised “due diligence in pursuing the case during the period ¿heº seeks to toll.” Ali v. Gonzales, 448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir. 2006); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir. 2000). A motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must also meet the procedural requirements set out in Matter of Lozada, supra. Finally, the movant must establish that she suffered prejudice because of her attorney’s actions or failure to act. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 638.
 
*2 No matter how ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled. See Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006). The filing deadline for motions to reopen will be equitably tolled until the ineffective assistance is or should have been discovered by a reasonable person in the situation. See Cekic v. INS, supra. The party seeking such tolling bears the burden of proving that he was, in fact, diligent. See id.
 
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not adequately comply with the Matter of Lozada, supra, requirements as there was no proof a complaint was filed with the disciplinary committee or his prior counsel (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent was present at the merits hearing, aware and cognizant of the adverse determination rendered against him in 2003, and acknowledged that he wanted to appeal the decision at that time (I.J. at 2-3). Although he allegedly lost contact with his attorney, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent failed to present sufficient evidence that he attempted to write or contact his attorney or the Board of Immigration Appeals to inquire about the status of his case (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge held that even assuming arguendo there was ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent did not demonstrate due diligence by waiting 6-years to file his motion. See Cekic v. INS, supra. As the respondent filed the current motion to reopen approximately 6-years late, the respondent has not shown the requisite due diligence. Therefore, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the time bar for filing a motion to reopen may not be equitably tolled in his case (I.J. at 2). See Cekic v. INS, supra; see also Iavorski v. INS, supra.
 
Finally, the respondent argues that the prior Immigration Judge was biased and had a predisposition towards a disfavorable ruling in his case (Respondent’s Br. at 4-5). Although the Immigration Judge was dissatisfied with the respondent’s non-responsive and evasive answers, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the prior Immigration Judge’s behavior or statements on this record do not support a finding that he was biased or had pre-judged the case. Moreover, we note that the respondent’s disagreement with the ultimate outcome of the Immigration Judge’s decision is insufficient to demonstrate that the outcome was the result of bias or pre-judgement rather than his view of the facts and evidence presented. Consequently, we find that the respondent was not deprived of a full and fair hearing and received his due process. In sum, the respondent has failed to raise any argument on appeal warranting disturbing the Immigration Judge’s decision.
 
*3 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Ted Y. Yamada
Deputy Chief Counsel
 
REISSUED DECISION
 
*1 On May 20, 2010, the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision finding him to be an arriving alien who was inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii), for making a false claim of United States citizenship. On August 18, 2010, the respondent filed a “Motion to Reopen Proceedings for Entry of New, Duplicate Decision Due to Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.” The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition to the motion. The motion will be granted.
 
We have considered the arguments presented by the parties in light of Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (finding that the Board has discretion to consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel based on the conduct of counsel that occurred after a final order of removal has been entered). We have also considered this matter in light of Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000) (concluding that strict compliance with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), is not required when ineffectiveness is obvious), and Lo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 934 (9th Cir. 2003) (waiving strict Lozada compliance when the attorney promptly acknowledged the error and there was no suggestion of collusion).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
 
 
APPLICATION: 212(c) waiver
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision of July 7, 2010, pretermitting his request for a waiver under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c))(repealed 1996) and ordering him removed from the United States. The respondent has also submitted a motion to terminate his removal proceedings and a motion to reconsider and reopen his proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed. The motions will be denied.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard, and review all other issues, including whether the parties have met their burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii). Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent was convicted of an aggravated felony drug trafficking crime based upon his 1991 guilty plea for violating Connecticut General Statutes (CGS) § 21a-277a (Possession with Intent to Distribute Narcotics), for which he was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment (I.J. at 2, 4; Notice to Appear). The Immigration Judge also concluded that the respondent is not eligible for a 212(c) waiver because he served more than 5 years in prison for his 1991 aggravated felony conviction. Alternatively, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.44(k)(2), the Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for 212(c) relief because he illegally returned to the United States after being issued a final order of removal. The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that his conviction constitutes an aggravated felony. The respondent also asserts that the Immigration Judge applied the wrong legal precedent to conclude that he is ineligible to apply for nunc pro tunc consideration of his 212(c) waiver application.¿FN1º
 
While we disagree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is ineligible for a §212(c) waiver due to his prior deportation and re-entry, we agree with his conclusion that the respondent is ineligible due to his aggravated felony conviction and time served. The Immigration Judge applied the modified categorical approach to determine whether the respondent’s conviction constitutes an aggravated felony (I.J. at 4). The Immigration Judge considered the respondent’s plea colloquy, which shows the criminal court judge clearly informed the respondent that he was “charged with Possession of Cocaine with Intent to Sell” in violation of CGS § 21a-277a (Superior Court transcript of State of Connecticut v. Desmond Whyte, dated July 23, 1991 at p. 2). See Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, (2005) (to determine whether a guilty plea to an offense under a nongeneric statute necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense it is proper to consider a transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant). As such, we disagree with the respondent’s argument on appeal that his conviction did not list a “specific/particular substance,” and his assertion that the Immigration Judge relied on improper evidence to conclude that his conviction constituted a drug trafficking aggravated felony (Respondent’s Brief at 4). Sections 101(a)(43)(B); 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ l101(a)(43)(B); 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). The respondent also argues that “there is nothing in the guilty plea transcripts indicating that he … ‘admitted’ that he possessed ‘cocaine with intent to sell,”’ and he asserts the Connecticut statutory definition of sale as applied to illegal drug transactions is “much broader than the common definition of sale as an ‘exchange of an object for a value”’ (Respondent’s brief at 5-6). However, the respondent’s plea colloquy repeatedly affirms his intent to sell the cocaine that was in his possession and the proffered facts indicate that he was involved in selling cocaine for money (see Superior Court transcript of State of Connecticut v. Desmond Whyte, dated July 23, 1991, at pp. 2, 5-6, 12-13).
 
*2 Turning to the respondent’s request for a 212(c) waiver, he argues that the Immigration Judge erred by not applying the authority of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to his case. We disagree. Once a proper venue for a removal hearing has been determined, an Immigration Judge should analyze removability and relief issues using only the decisions of the circuit in which he or she sits (as well as decisions of the Supreme Court and this Board) as binding authority, since it is to that circuit that any appeal from a final order of removal must be taken. Section 242(b)(2) of the Act. The venue for the respondent’s proceedings was Boston, Massachusetts, under the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Therefore, the Immigration Judge properly concluded that the respondent is ineligible for 212(c) relief because he accrued more than 5 years in prison based upon an aggravated felony conviction. Pereira v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 38, 42-45 (1st Cir. 2005) (an alien continues to accrue time toward the five-year bar to section 212(c) relief after the issuance of a final order of removal, even if based upon an erroneous retroactive application of AEDPA). See also 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(f)(4)(i). The decision of the federal District Judge dismissing the indictment of the respondent for illegal re-entry after deportation may have had the effect of voiding the final administrative order of deportation represented by the Board’s decision of April 26, 2000. However, jurisdiction over this case now lies in the First Circuit due to the filing of a superceding Notice to Appear on February 12, 2010.
 
The respondent’s motions primarily reiterate the arguments he addressed in his appellate brief. Furthermore, the district court decision cited by the respondent in his motions and appellate brief is not binding upon this Board. See Matter of K-S-, 20 I&N Dec. 715 (BIA 1993). Regarding the respondent’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider and Reopen at pp. 4-5), there is no evidence that the respondent’s counsel performed in a manner that would justify remanding this case to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the following orders shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to terminate is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to reconsider and reopen is denied.

In 1996, an Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for a section 212(c) waiver based upon section 440(d) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”) (I.J. at 2). Subsequently, it was determined that restrictions on section 212(c) added by the AEDPA did not apply retroactively. INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Alan J. Pollack, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
 
*1 This case was previously before the Board on June 7, 2010, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal of the Immigration Judge’s September 3, 2008, decision finding the respondent removable as charged and ineligible to adjust his status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1255, in the current proceedings. On July 1, 2010, the respondent filed a timely motion to reopen and reconsider based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. For the reasons set out below, the respondent’s motion will be denied.
 
We reject the respondent’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. An ineffective assistance of counsel claim must demonstrate that the alien has been prejudiced by the former counsel’s poor performance. See Rranci v. Attorney General of the United States, 540 F.3d 165, 175-76 (3d Cir. 2008) (stating that the alien “must show that there was a reasonable likelihood that the result would have been different if the error¿sº … had not occurred.”). Consequently, even if the respondent’s former counsel has been disciplined by state bar authorities or may have provided incompetent representation, the respondent is nonetheless required to demonstrate prejudice at the hearing below or on appeal. However, in the case at bar, the respondent cannot demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his former counsel’s actions or inactions because he is not eligible for adjustment of status as he entered the United States without being admitted or paroled. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.1(b)(3). Further, even assuming arguendo the respondent is an arriving alien based on his subsequent parole,¿FN1º the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), not the Immigration Judge, has jurisdiction to consider the respondent’s adjustment of status application, see 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(1)(i)-(ii),¿FN2º and the Board generally lacks the authority to reopen the proceedings of aliens under final orders of removal who seek to pursue relief for which the Board has no jurisdiction. See Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103 (BIA 2009). Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen and reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion for a stay is denied.

The respondent has not supported his claim that he is an arriving alien because he was paroled after entering the United States without inspection. A case previously cited by the respondent, Zheng v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 98 (3d 2008), is distinguishable from the case at bar because in that case the alien left the United States pursuant to an advance parole.

2

Because the respondent was not granted advance parole, he does not qualify for an exception wherein the Immigration Judge would have jurisdiction over an arriving alien. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(1)(ii)(B), (D).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se¿FN1º
 
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has had a final order of removal since 1999. Many years later, the respondent requested reopening based on her marriage to a United States citizen spouse. Among other arguments, the respondent alleged that her former attorneys and a nonattorney had provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The Immigration Judge denied reopening on a number of grounds. The respondent filed a timely Notice of Appeal. On May 11, 2009, the Board dismissed the appeal. The respondent filed a timely petition for review, which has been stayed pending resolution of the present motion.
 
On March 16, 2010, over 10 months after the Board’s May 2009 decision, the respondent filed the present motion to reopen. The motion is time and number-barred. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent contends that the time and number-bars should be equitably tolled because the attorney who filed the motion to reopen provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion shall be denied.
 
The respondent has the burden to demonstrate that she exercised due diligence during the “entire” time she seeks to have tolled, which “includes both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed. Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir. 2008). See also Wang v. BIA, supra at 716 (“Wang has failed to satisfy his burden of establishing due diligence..”); Ali v. Gonzales, 448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir. 2007)(alien must demonstrate that he exercised due diligence in pursuing the case during the period the alien seeks to toll); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006)(“¿Nºo matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled.”).
 
According to PACER, current counsel filed a Notice of Appearance with the Second Circuit on July 30, 2009. The present motion was not filed until March 16, 2010, and neither counsel nor the respondent has provided a sufficient explanation as to why the motion was filed over 7 months later. Therefore, due diligence has not been demonstrated.
 
The other arguments raised involve reconsideration of our May 2009 decision, but the respondent did not file a timely motion to reconsider. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b). We decline, moreover, to exercise our sua sponte authority as the respondent has not demonstrated exceptional circumstances justifying the exercise of our discretionary authority to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the motion shall be denied.
 
*2 ORDER: The motion is denied.

The respondent is considered pro se because her counsel did not submit a Notice of Entry of Appearance on Form EOIR-27. Rather, counsel for the respondent filed a Form EOIR-28 with the original motion, and then mistakenly refiled a Form EOIR-28 after being contacted by the Clerk’s office. Since the Clerk’s office acknowledged counsel’s appearance, a courtesy copy of this decision shall be mailed to Frederick P.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:

Amy S. Paulick
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondents, natives and citizens of Bolivia, move to reopen.¿FN1º 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). On October 28, 2009, we dismissed the appeal of the December 11, 2007, Immigration Judge order denying a motion to reopen. The facts argued in the instant motion are virtually the same as those argued before the Immigration Judge, i.e., that the respondent filed for adjustment of status using an approved Petition for Alien Worker (Form I-140). For an unknown reason, prior counsel, Attorney Amelia Ramer, while representing the respondents before the Immigration Judge, withdrew the application for adjustment of status (Form I-245) and accepted voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.§ 1229c(a).
 
The respondent argues ineffective assistance of counsel, but against two people who represented her before Ms. Ramer (see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen filed November 25, 2009 at the Board (“the instant motion”) at 2). The instant motion requests an opportunity to pursue adjustment of status. However, all of the proffered documents pre-date our prior decision. We considered the ineffective assistance of counsel argument in our final decision, in which we concluded that the Immigration Judge was correct in finding that there was no egregious conduct on the part of counsel that would warrant reopening.
 
Nothing has been presented in the instant motion to reopen to cause us to revisit or reverse our prior decision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the motion. No new, material, previously unavailable evidence has been proffered that would warrant reopening. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered;
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.¿FN2º

The instant motion requests a “stay” of the voluntary departure period. However, the period, which was granted by the Immigration Judge, has long since concluded. Although not requested, we note that withdrawal of the request for voluntary departure is also not an option. See section 240B(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(b)(3)(iii).

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Vincent P. Martin, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on July 30, 2010, when the Board dismissed the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen his deportation proceedings that were conducted in absentia on May 9, 1994. Specifically, noting that the record contains several notices of hearing that were mailed by certified mail to the last address provided by the respondent, the Board concluded that the respondent has not overcome the presumption of effective delivery by substantial and probative evidence of improper delivery. See Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27, 37 (BIA 1995). On September 1, 2010, the respondent filed a request for reconsideration. The motion will be denied.
 
By notice dated August 27, 2010, the respondent was notified that his motion to reconsider was being rejected because it did not contain the required fee or Fee Waiver Request form (Form EOIR-26A), and the motion was not accompanied by a completed Notice of Entry of Appearance (Form-EOIR-27). The respondent did not resubmit his motion until September 1, 2010. Therefore, the respondent’s motion to reconsider is untimely.¿FN1º
 
Nevertheless, to the extent the respondent’s motion rests on previously raised issues, the respondent has not identified any issue that was not considered in the Board’s previous detailed decision, nor has he identified any error of fact or law in that decision that would alter the outcome. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). Notably, although the respondent’s notices of hearing were ultimately returned as unclaimed, they were properly sent by certified mail to the last known address provided by the respondent (Notice of Hearing dated March 21, 1994, and corresponding envelope and certified mail receipt; Notice of Hearing dated April 11, 1994, and corresponding envelope and certified mail receipt). Further, the record contains no evidence indicating that the respondent ever notified the Immigration Court of any change in his address since service of the Order to Show Cause in 1994, which the respondent does not deny receiving. See Matter of Grijalva, supra. Under the circumstances, we do not find the respondent’s assertion that he did not reside at the address to which his notices of hearings were sent alone sufficient to demonstrate that the notices of hearings were sent to the wrong address. See, e.g., Joshi v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 732, 735 (7th Cir. 2004) (stating that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving, denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence”). Nor do we find the respondent’s mere disagreement with or disapproval of the outcome of the Board’s previous detailed decision sufficient to demonstrate either that the Board improperly evaluated or disregarded the facts and evidence presented or committed legal error. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Amy N. Gell, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The Board issued a decision in this case on June 2, 2010, dismissing the respondent’s appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision denying a motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent was previously ordered removed in absentia on July 2, 2007. The respondent has filed a timely motion for reconsideration of our June 2, 2010, decision and another motion to reopen proceedings. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the motion, which will be denied.
 
A motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration, be supported by pertinent case precedent and be predicated on a legal or factual defect in the decision. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1); Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). A motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied. A motion to reconsider is not a mechanism by which a party may file a new brief before the Board raising additional legal arguments that are unrelated to those issues raised before the Immigration Judge and on appeal. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra. Notwithstanding the respondent’s disagreement with our decision and our evaluation of the evidence, we find no legal or factual defect in our June 2010 decision, based on the record then before us. Consequently, reconsideration is not warranted.
 
The motion to reopen is predicated upon a claim against the respondent’s former attorney. However, the respondent has not shown substantial compliance with the threshold requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003), and Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). While the respondent in his affidavit states generally that the Lozada requirements have been met, he has not submitted a copy of the letter to his former attorney or a bar complaint. It is especially important to provide proof of compliance with the Lozada requirements where, as in this case, a respondent’s most recent affidavit contradicts information provided in an prior affidavit and he now claims that he was unaware of the contents of the prior affidavit prepared by his former attorney. Therefore, reopening is not warranted.
 
*2 Accordingly, the motion to reconsider our prior decision and the motion to reopen proceedings will be denied.
 
ORDER: The motion for reconsideration of the June 2, 2010, decision and the motion to reopen proceedings are denied.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
James Hallagan, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Kelley N. Sydnor
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Remand
 
*1 The respondent is a citizen of Thailand. She appeals the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 24, 2010. Therein, an Immigration Judge found her removable from the United States pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i). The Immigration Judge further denied the respondent’s application for voluntary departure in the exercise of discretion. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent argues on appeal that she was denied due process in these proceedings. The respondent acknowledges that her former counsel conceded that she was removable from the United States pursuant to the aforementioned charge through written pleadings. She contends that her former counsel should not have conceded and the Immigration Judge should not have found her removable pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act. The respondent concedes that she entered and was admitted into the United States using a false name.¿FN1º
 
A formal concession of removability made by the respondent’s attorney acting in his professional capacity during the respondent’s removal hearing and in the respondent’s presence is binding on the respondent as a judicial admission. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377,382 (BIA 1986); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c). There is no basis for the respondent to now challenge the factual findings or legal conclusions of the Immigration Judge that arose from that concession.
 
The respondent further argues on appeal that her former counsel provided her ineffective assistance of counsel. The procedural requirements for proving ineffective assistance of counsel were not satisfied. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).¿FN2º We further do not find that the respondent’s former counsel’s concession to the charge of removability constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. It appears that former counsel made the tactical decision to admit to a violation of section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Act rather than requesting a finding of removability pursuant to the more serious charge for violating section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act. We do not find that counsel’s actions constituted a dereliction of duty. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998). We therefore do not see a reason to invalidate these proceedings or remand the record for the Immigration Judge to make an additional finding of removability pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act.
 
*2 The respondent further indicates on appeal that she desires a remand to file an application before the Immigration Judge for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The respondent abandoned her opportunity to file those applications because she did not do so at her hearing. She further indicates that she intends to file an application for a visa with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. However, she has not established her prima facie eligibility for a grant of adjustment of status before the Immigration Judge. We will not remand the proceedings. The Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable and denying her application for voluntary departure is affirmed.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

Presumably, the respondent’s contention is that the Immigration Judge should have found her removable from the United States for fraud or misrepresentation pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i).

The respondent’s current counsel’s assertions about the lack of communication between the respondent and prior counsel is not evidence. See Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Douglas D. Nelson, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jonathan Grant
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
  
AMENDED ORDER
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on August 26, 2008, when we denied the respondent’s second motion to reopen, filed on June 16, 2008. However, the record reflects that the respondent had also filed a motion to reconsider on April 16, 2008, which was pending at the time and which we did not explicitly and separately address in our decision. We are therefore reopening proceedings on our own motion to include an adjudication of the respondent’s motion to reconsider. Moreover, given that the law which served as the basis of our denial of the motion to reopen has since changed, we will vacate our prior order in its entirety and issue the following decision.
 
The respondent’s April 16, 2008, motion to reconsider will be denied. The respondent sought reconsideration of our March 18, 2008, decision denying his December 3, 2007, motion to reopen as untimely. In his motion to reopen, the respondent had argued that sua sponte reopening was warranted based upon the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2005), which held that lawful admission and legal permanent residence of a parent could be imputed to a minor child to satisfy the continuous residence requirement for cancellation of removal under section 240A(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(2). We declined to reopen sua sponte, given that the case had been published more than 2 years prior to the untimely filing of the motion. We find no reason to disturb that determination. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2; see Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006). Accordingly, the motion to reconsider will be denied, as we find no error in our decision as based upon the record before us at that time.
 
However, the respondent’s June 16, 2008, motion to reopen will be granted. In that motion, the respondent asserts that the failure to timely reopen was due to the ineffective assistance of his former counsel. In our August 26, 2008, decision, we denied the motion to reopen, finding that Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, supra, was no longer binding on the Board in light of our explicit disagreement with that case in Matter of Ramirez-Vargas, 24 I&N Dec. 599 (BIA 2008) and Matter of Escobar, 24 I&N Dec. 231 (BIA 2007). However, since that time, the Ninth Circuit has reaffirmed its holding in Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, supra, finding the Board’s contrary interpretation to be unreasonable. See Mercado-Zazueta v. Holder, 580 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir. 2009). The Ninth Circuit noted that although agencies retain discretion to determine ambiguous statutes, an agency may not “resurrect a statutory interpretation that a circuit court has foreclosed by rejecting it as unreasonable.” Id. at 1114; see also Matter of Diaz and Lopez, 25 I&N Dec. 188, 190 (BIA 2010) (acknowledging same). Therefore, as the respondent claims to have been residing in the United States since 1992 with his father, who was a lawful permanent resident and is now a United States citizen, he appears to be statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal.
 
*2 Although the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) challenges the motion as time-barred and number-barred under the regulations, we find that equitable tolling of the filing deadline is warranted. The respondent asserts that his former counsel erred in failing to file a timely motion to reopen after Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, supra, was issued. We note that the respondent has complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Moreover, we accept the respondent’s rationale for not filing a bar complaint. Former counsel has submitted an affidavit admitting his error, and the respondent’s current attorney attests to the prior attorney’s complete cooperation in remedying the oversight. Moreover, the respondent reports that his former attorney had performed work for the respondent beyond their contract without remuneration (June 16, 2008, Motion to Reopen, 4-7).
 
Therefore, as the respondent has shown that he was “prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error,” the deadline will be equitably tolled and his motion is deemed timely. See Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir. 2003); see also Singh v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 1182, 1185-86 (9th Cir. 2004). Notably, the DHS has presented no argument opposing equitable tolling. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The Board’s August 26, 2008, order is vacated.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s April 16, 2008, motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s June 16, 2008, motion to reopen is hereby granted.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Justine M. Daly, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Cynthia D. Goodman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, appeals the Immigration Judge’s March 20, 2009, denial of his motion to reconsider a January 5, 2009, Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.
 
The respondent sought reopening of an order dated September 10, 2008, in which the Immigration Judge found the respondent had not requested any form of relief, that no relief was available to him, and ordered him removed to Mexico. The respondent waived appeal. The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. On January 5, 2009, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen because the respondent had not established that he was prima facie eligible for relief. The respondent filed a January 28, 2009, motion to reconsider. Based on the motion to reconsider, the Immigration Judge entered a new decision on March 20, 2009, correcting a legal error. However, the motion was again denied because the respondent failed to demonstrate he was prima facie eligible for relief. We now consider the respondent’s appeal of that decision.
 
A motion to reopen for the purpose of providing the alien an opportunity to apply for any form of discretionary relief will not be granted if it appears that the alien’s right to apply for such relief was fully explained to him or her by the Immigration Judge and an opportunity to apply therefore was afforded at the hearing, unless the relief is sought on the basis of circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). The respondent has made no showing of new circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the Immigration Judge’s decision. However, the respondent argues on appeal that if not for the ineffective assistance of counsel, the respondent would have filed the appropriate applications for relief with the Immigration Judge. The respondent further argues that he is prima facie eligible for the relief requested and reopening is appropriate. Respondent’s brief at 15, 17.
 
A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the requirements set forth in our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). It is also required that the claimant establish that he suffered prejudice as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 640. The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). This means that it is likely that an alien would have prevailed at the hearing or on appeal had the negligent representation not occurred. Id. The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998). Based on the documentation presented, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent has met the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra, for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
*2 However, the Immigration Judge denied reopening because the respondent had not demonstrated that he was prejudiced as a result of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. Specifically, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent was not prima facie eligible for relief and would not have prevailed at a hearing. The respondent argues that he is eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(d)(11) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(11). The respondent concedes that he was convicted on July 18, 2007, in the United States District Court, Western District of Texas, Del Rio Division, for the offense of aiding and abetting the attempted illegal entry of an alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(3) and 18 U.S.C. § 2. Based on this conviction, the respondent is removable as an alien who knowingly encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the United States in violation of law pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i). However, the respondent argues that the aliens he was assisting in entering the country were his step children and he is eligible for consideration of a waiver under section 212(d)(11) of the Act. The respondent offers a Declaration and Registration of Informal Marriage, to support his contention that under the laws of Texas he was common law married when he brought his step children into the United States illegally. The Immigration Judge found that the evidence was not sufficient to indicate that a common law marriage existed at the time of the respondent’s July 7, 2007, arrest because although the document states that the marriage began prior to the incident on January 7, 2007, the declaration was not executed until April 7, 2008 (I.J. at 6).
 
The marriage of a man and woman in Texas may be proven by evidence that a declaration of their marriage has been signed. See Texas Family Code section 2.401(a)(1). Furthermore, the Texas courts have found that a declaration of marriage constitutes prima facie proof of the parties’ informal marriage. See Russell v. Russell, 865 S.W. 2d 929, 931 (Tex. 1993); Husband v. Pierce, 800 S.W. 2d 661 (Tex. 1990) (declaration is a prima facie showing of union). Therefore, we find that the Immigration Judge erred in not finding the respondent had provided prima facie evidence of his eligibility for the section 212(d)(11) waiver. The evidence sufficiently demonstrated the respondent had been prejudiced by his former attorney’s ineffective assistance. Based on this evidence, we will remand to the Immigration Judge for initial consideration of the respondent’s eligibility for the claimed waiver.
 
*3 We note that although the respondent has provided sufficient evidence to support reopening, the evidence does not necessarily establish the required family relationship for a section 212(d)(11) waiver. Section 2.401 of the Texas Family Code provides only that a marriage may be proven by evidence of a signed declaration, not that the marriage is definitively established by such a declaration. The Texas courts have held that they are not bound to find a marriage as stated in a declaration when there is evidence to the contrary. See Colburn v. The State of Texas, 966 S. W. 2d 511 (Tex. 1998). We agree with the Immigration Judge’s factual finding that since the declaration of marriage was executed subsequent to the respondent’s arrest for alien smuggling, there is some evidence in the record that does not support an informal marriage was created on January 7, 2007 (I.J. at 5). Therefore, on remand the Immigration Judge will consider additional evidence, make explicit fact finding and conduct additional legal analysis as to whether a common law marriage had been established by July 7, 2007.
 
Furthermore, we note that eligibility for a section 212(d)(11) waiver is not based solely upon the establishment of the claimed relationship. See Matter of Compean, 21 I&N Dec. 51 (BIA 1995). Rather, the respondent must establish that such a grant is for humanitarian reasons, to assure family unity, or is otherwise in the public interest. See section 212(d)(11) of the Act; Matter of Compean, supra.
 
Finally, we find no basis to remand to a different Immigration Judge, as requested by the respondent. We have reviewed the contention by the respondent that the Immigration Judge has demonstrated bias in this matter. This contention, without further support, is insufficient to justify remand to another Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judge has conducted these proceedings in a generally fair way, and we see no persuasive evidence of bias on the part of the Immigration Judge, such as to require a remand to a different Immigration Judge. See Matter of G-, 20 I&N Dec. 764, 781 (BIA 1993). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se¿FN1º
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Joey L. Caccarozzo
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed an Immigration Judge’s December 16, 2008, denial of her motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b). The Department of Homeland Security has filed an opposition. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including any determination of credibility, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of H-L-H- & Z-Y-Z-, 25 I&N Dec. 209, 211 (BIA 2010).
 
On November 7, 2007, the respondent was ordered removed to Kenya after having failed to comply with biometric requirements. She filed a motion to reopen on November 14, 2007, which the Immigration Judge granted on December 3, 2007. On July 17, 2008, the Immigration Judge deemed the respondent’s application for adjustment of status to have been withdrawn, but granted her voluntary departure. The respondent filed a second motion to reopen on November 14, 2008, which the Immigration Judge denied on December 16, 2008. We affirm the Immigration Judge’s denial of this untimely and number-barred motion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
 
In her second motion to reopen and on appeal, the respondent has alleged the ineffective assistance of two prior counsels. However, in making these allegations, she failed to meet any of the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 851F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). That is, she failed, even on appeal, to submit an affidavit detailing the agreements she had with her prior counsels, to assert that the prior counsels have been informed of the allegations leveled against them and been given an opportunity to respond, or to confirm that bar complaints have been filed against the prior counsels, or alternatively, explain why such complaints have not been filed. See Matter of Lozada, supra, at 639; Barry v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 741, 745-46 (4th Cir. 2006).
 
The respondent also argued on appeal that, in addition to the requirements of Matter of Lozada, the Immigration Judge appeared to require a showing that the prior counsels were not in “good standing” with the Immigration Court (Respondent’s Brief at 4-6; I.J. at 1). However, our reading of the Immigration Judge’s order is not that he added such a requirement for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, but rather that he just noted in passing that both of the prior counsels were generally considered to be in good standing in his court. In any event, whether or not these attorneys were in “good standing” has no bearing on whether the respondent has otherwise fulfilled the Lozada requirements.
 
*2 Further, in the absence of egregious circumstances, an alien is bound by the “reasonable tactical actions” of his or her counsel. Matter of Gawaran, 20 I&N Dec. 938 (BIA 1995). Based on the respondent’s allegations, we are unable to conclude that the actions of either of her prior counsels were egregious. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377 (BIA 1986). Finally, we conclude that the circumstances of this case do not warrant sua sponte reopening.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Paul S. Zolton, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case is before us pursuant to an order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granting an unopposed motion to remand the record. In a decision dated October 30, 2009, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal, but failed to directly address the respondent’s motion to remand the record. The respondent has also filed a motion to reopen the proceedings based on the ineffective assistance of previous counsel. The motion will be granted and the record remanded for further proceedings and the entry of a new decision.
 
We review the findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether or not the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
 
The respondent argues that her previous attorney failed to timely submit evidence that was material to her case. In our previous decision, we noted that this particular document was not important due to some problems with the testimony concerning how it was obtained. The respondent has now submitted additional evidence bolstering the importance of this document and an affidavit from her former attorney stating that he erred in not submitting this document earlier. The respondent has substantially complied with our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). In addition to this, the respondent has now also submitted additional support for her claim, some of which was not available at the time of the previous hearing and appears material to her claim.
 
Based on the ineffective assistance of counsel, the new and material evidence the respondent has submitted, as well as, the request of the Fourth Circuit, we will reopen the proceedings and remand the record for the Immigration Judge to consider the respondent’s statutory’ eligibility for relief and whether or not discretion should be exercised on her behalf.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted and the record remanded for further proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Anita Delgado, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Leigh Mapplebeck
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
*1 The respondent appeals from the April 7, 2010, decision of the Immigration Judge denying her motion to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, was placed in removal proceedings in 1997 and conceded removability (see Exh. 1). On July 8, 1998, the respondent failed to appear at a hearing and was ordered removed in absentia. On October 26, 1998, an Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s motion to reopen the proceedings. The respondent’s counsel was subsequently issued notice that the respondent should appear for a hearing on March 30, 1999. On that date, neither the respondent nor her counsel appeared, and another in absentia order was entered.
 
In October 2003, the respondent, through new counsel, filed a motion to reopen asserting that her prior counsel, whose name she could not recall, informed her that she did not need to appear for her removal hearing. She explained her husband was the beneficiary of an approved Form I-140, and she wanted to pursue adjustment of status. On November 3, 2003, the Immigration Judge denied the motion finding that the hearing notice had been properly issued to the respondent’s counsel, and that the respondent did not present evidence to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, including her own statement. The Immigration Judge pointed out that several years had passed since the in absentia hearing, and the respondent knew she had been placed in proceedings.
 
On March 12, 2010, the respondent filed another motion to reopen, this time supported by her own declaration claiming she did not receive notice of her hearing. She reiterated her desire to apply for adjustment of status and submitted supporting documentation. On April 7, 2010, the Immigration Judge denied the motion finding that the respondent did not establish exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear.
 
The respondent has filed this appeal. She again claims her prior counsel never advised her of her hearing date, and she because he is deceased, she cannot comply with the documentary requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. She asserts that the 180-day limit for filing a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances should be equitably tolled. She emphasizes that she also seeks reopening based on previously unavailable evidence supporting her eligibility for adjustment of status.
 
We will not disturb the Immigration Judge’s decision. In her 2003 motion, the respondent blamed her failure to appear on her prior counsel, but did not submit evidence which satisfied any of the requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). She did not adequately remedy this deficiency in her 2010 motion, wherein she provided a statement that she did not receive her notice of hearing but provided no explanation regarding her relationship with prior counsel. Both of the motions were also untimely as they were filed outside of the 180-day limit for motions to reopen based on exceptional circumstances for a failure to appear. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). The respondent’s failure to properly support her motions, as well as her several year delay in filing her first motion without sufficient explanation, preclude reopening under an equitable tolling theory. See Aris v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 595 (2d Cir. 2008); Wang v. BIA, 508 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir. 2007). Finally, the respondent’s argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that prior counsel is deceased does not excuse her failure to submit adequate documentation earlier in the proceedings. Setting aside the in absentia issues, insofar as the respondent’s motion is based on previously unavailable relief and new evidence, it is untimely. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349 (BIA 1998).
 
*2 We conclude that the respondent has not set forth any basis for reopening her removal proceedings. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX6 548 - Las Vegas, NV
November 3, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
William F. Levings, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Christian Parke
Assistant Chief Counsel
*1 The respondent appealed from the June 30, 2010, oral decision of the Immigration Judge, which found him removable; determined that he did not apply for, and did not demonstrate eligibility for, any relief from removal; and ordered him removed from the United States to the Philippines. While his appeal was pending, he filed a motion to remand. The motion to remand will be granted, and the record will be remanded.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly found that the respondent was removable based on the charge in the Form I-261 charging document, as convicted of an aggravated felony under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), in conjunction with sections 101(a)(43)(G) and 101(a)(43)(U) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(G) and 1101(a)(43)(U). As substantiated by conviction documents, the respondent has a 2006 Nevada conviction upon a guilty plea for conspiracy to commit burglary. For that crime, he was sentenced to imprisonment of 1 year, with imposition of sentence suspended subject to completion of probation, originally. The prison sentence was imposed subsequently, upon probation revocation in 2008. The respondent was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on or about February 10, 1988. The Immigration Judge indicated that the respondent did not wish to apply for any form of removal relief, based on his statements through counsel at his hearing (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 42).
 
On appeal and in his motion to remand, the respondent argues that his conviction is invalid because he entered a defective guilty plea based on ineffective assistance from criminal counsel. However, the fact that he may be pursuing post-conviction relief in the form of a collateral attack on that conviction in state criminal court does not affect its finality for federal immigration purposes. See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992). The respondent has presented no evidence with this appeal that any attack on his conviction has resulted in any vacatur. His speculation that his conviction might be invalid does not change the finality for immigration purposes of such conviction, unless and until it were to be overturned by a criminal court. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996).
 
Further, the respondent asserts that he now wishes to apply on remand for withholding of removal under the Act and for protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (“CAT”). We observe that he stands convicted of conspiracy to commit burglary. Since the respondent was sentenced to imprisonment of 1 year for his theft offense, he has been convicted of an aggravated felony. As an aggravated felon, the respondent is statutorily ineligible for asylum under the Act. See sections 208(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 208(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 1158(b)(2)(B)(i). To demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal under the Act, the respondent would have to establish that, if he were to return to the Philippines, it is more likely than not that he would be subjected to persecution on account of a statutory ground. See section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3). To demonstrate eligibility for CAT protection, the respondent would have to prove that, if removed to the Philippines, he would more likely than not be tortured at the instigation or with the acquiescence (to include the concept of willful blindness) of a public official acting in his or her official capacity. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c)(2) and 1208.18(a)(1) (2010). He alleges that he fears returning to the Philippines because he believes that his father, who served in the military and as a police officer, was murdered in 2004 by his enemies for political reasons. The respondent has submitted a completed Form I-589 application accompanied by four affidavits, his own September 2010 affidavit and July 2010 affidavits from two relatives and an acquaintance.
 
*2 In addition, the respondent maintains that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from the attorney who represented him in his removal proceedings. In his affidavit and motion, he states that his former attorney did not consult with him before telling the Immigration Judge that there was no relief available to him; did not raise his expressed fear of returning to the Philippines with the Immigration Judge; did not submit a brief even after the Immigration Judge afforded him two extra weeks to do so; did not proffer any reason for not submitting the brief; did not visit him in detention; and rarely spoke to him at his hearings. We find that the respondent has substantially complied with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), as he has submitted his own affidavit and a copy of a complaint that was filed with the State Bar of Nevada and also was sent to his prior attorney. See Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009).
 
Under the circumstances of this case, we find it appropriate to grant the motion to remand so that the respondent’s claims for withholding of removal and CAT protection may be evaluated by the Immigration Judge. Since we have granted the motion to remand, we need not reach the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim and need not determine whether he has demonstrated prejudice from counsel’s alleged action or inaction pursuant to Matter of Lozada, supra, as we expect that the respondent will have the opportunity to present fully his withholding and CAT claims, the inaction regarding which underlies his ineffective assistance claim. See Aguilar-Ramos v. Holder, 594 F.3d 701 (9th Cir. 2010). On remand, both the respondent and the Department of Homeland Security may introduce any and all available evidence that is relevant to his eligibility for withholding of removal and CAT protection.¿FN1º
 
Accordingly, we will grant the motion to remand and will remand the record.
 
ORDER: The motion to remand is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings and for the issuance of a new decision, consistent with this opinion.

To the extent that the respondent references issues related to his bond and custody status, we lack authority in these removal proceedings to address those matters, which must be raised in the context of his separate bond proceedings.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Marisa Aguilar, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The Board entered the final administrative order in these proceedings on February 6, 2008. On October 8, 2010, the respondent filed this untimely motion to reopen. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The motion will be denied.
 
The respondent seeks reopening to apply for relief from removal, including adjustment of status as the spouse of a United States citizen.¿FN1º It does not appear that any exception to the filing deadline applies to this motion, however. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3). See also Matter of Yauri, 25 I&N Dec. 103, 105 (BIA 2009) (untimely motions to reopen to apply for adjustment of status generally do not fall within any of the statutory or regulatory exceptions for motions to reopen and are generally denied). Nor do we find that equitable tolling of the filing deadline based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is warranted in this case. See Ajose v. Gonzales, 408 F.3d 393, 395 (7th Cir.2005) (holding that the administrative time-limit on motions to reopen is non-jurisdictional and subject to equitable tolling); Pervaiz v. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 488 (7th Cir. 2005) (recognizing equitable tolling in cases of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
The respondent raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, alleging, inter alia, that his former attorney failed to notify him of the Board’s prior order. The respondent, however, has not complied with the procedural requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before this Board as set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See Patel v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 829 (7th Cir. 2007) (holding that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying an alien’s motion to reopen where the alien failed to fulfill the Lozada requirements). He has failed, therefore, to set forth a viable ineffective assistance of counsel claim against his former attorney.
 
Finally, we find no exceptional situation present in this case to persuade us to exercise our sua sponte authority to reopen the proceedings on our own motion. See Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). While we recognize that the respondent’s removal will likely result in hardship to the respondent and his family, we emphasize that we invoke our sua sponte authority sparingly, “treating it not as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but as an extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec. 1132, 1133-34 (BIA 1999).
 
*2 For the foregoing reasons, the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen will be denied. The respondent’s request for a stay of removal is also denied.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is denied.

IN RE: NESTOR ENRIQUE CORTEZ-VASQUEZ
File: AXXX XX5 340 - San Antonio, TX

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Christopher J. Stender, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Justin Adams
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on June 21, 2005, after failing to appear at a hearing. He filed a motion to reopen on July 8, 2009, and the Immigration Judge denied it on July 22, 2009. The respondent filed a second motion to reopen on May 10, 2010. The Immigration Judge denied it on July 12, 2010, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Immigration Judge’s decision sets out the history of this case. Underlying both of the respondent’s motions is his claim that he did not receive proper notice of his hearing. The respondent did not give an address at the time his Notice to Appear (NTA) was served upon him, and he did not subsequently provide the Immigration Court with an address. Therefore, the respondent was not entitled to receive actual notice of his hearing. See section 240(b)(5)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(5)(B); Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, 560 F.3d 354 (5th Cir. 2009), and the in absentia hearing was appropriate. The respondent emphasizes that he was only 17 years old when the NTA was served. However, the regulations provide that he was old enough to receive service of the NTA. See 8 C.F.R. § 103.5a(c)(ii). Moreover, the respondent was accompanied by his adult sister at the time of service (see Exhs 1, 2). Once served, it became incumbent on the respondent to provide an address where he was able to receive notices. As he did not do so, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not establish a basis for reopening based on a lack of proper notice of the in absentia hearing.
 
Insofar as the respondent raises issues outside of the notice of his hearing, he faces jurisdictional barriers as he acknowledges being removed from the United States on or about September 27, 2009, pursuant to the Immigration Judge’s June 21, 2005, decision (See R’s 2010 appeal brief at 4; 2010 motion to reopen at 4).¿FN1º See Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008); cf. Matter of Bulnes, 25 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 2009) (holding that an alien’s departure from the United States while under an outstanding order of deportation or removal issued in absentia does not deprive the Immigration Judge of jurisdiction to entertain a motion to reopen to rescind the order if the motion is premised upon lack of notice).
 
Additionally, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) provides that an alien may file only one motion to seek reopening of an order of removal entered in absentia. This is the respondent’s second motion to reopen. In this regard, even entertaining the respondent’s argument that his first motion was prepared with ineffective assistance of counsel and number and time bars should not be triggered, we respond that he has not satisfied the procedural requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 638 (BIA 1988); see also De Zavala v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 879 (5th Cir. 2004); Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, 252 F.3d 383, 385 n.2 (5th Cir. 2001). Finally, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not established any basis for reopening his proceedings under the William Wilberfore Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA). Most notably, the respondent was in fact accompanied at time of his 2005 entry by his sister, who had reached the age of majority, and placed in her custody; he was also traveling to see his parents who lived in Georgia. The respondent otherwise cites no specific provision of the TVPRA which would dictate that these proceedings should be reopened. Finally, we find no merit to the respondent’s argument that the Immigration Judge was obliged to advise the respondent of potential eligibility for relief in the context of denying the respondent’s motion to reopen. Cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.11(a), (c) (referring to Immigration Judge’s duties during a hearing).
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Particia Vargas, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jennifer W. Smith
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, timely requests reopening asserting that the ineffective assistance of his former counsel warrants further hearings on the issue of hardship to his qualifying relatives, four United States citizen children, for purposes of cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The motion will be denied.
 
Notwithstanding his assertion that his former attorney failed to submit evidence relating to country conditions in Mexico, the respondent has not proffered additional new evidence satisfying his “heavy burden” of demonstrating that if proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case. See Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 472-74 (BIA 1992); Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N 413 (BIA 1996); Matter of Andazola, 23 I&N Dec. 319 (BIA 2002) (describing exceptional and extremely unusual hardship). The respondent’s generalized claim of violence in Mexico does not sufficiently demonstrate hardship that is substantially different from, or beyond, that which would normally be expected upon returning with a parent to the parent’s country of citizenship, which may be a less developed country. See Matter of Monreal, 23 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2001). We acknowledge the present difficult conditions in Mexico, including the widespread violence there. However, the respondent has not sufficiently shown that his children would be left unprotected from harm or violence in Mexico.
 
Under the circumstances, we do not find the respondent’s assertion regarding his former attorney’s alleged action or inaction sufficient to demonstrate prejudice. See Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Nor has the respondent sufficiently complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
On this record, the respondent has not demonstrated that further hearings are warranted. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rosalind Kelly, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s May 25, 2010, decision, ordering him removed. The respondent has also requested that we remand the record based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The appeal will be dismissed as waived and the motion to remand will be denied.
 
The record reflects that the respondent waived appeal. The Immigration Judge asked the respondent’s counsel if appeal was reserved or waived (Tr. at 5). Counsel replied, at first, that “he’s not instructed me one way or the other.” Id. The respondent was asked if he wished to accept the Immigration Judge’s decision or if he wished to appeal, and the respondent replied that “It’s fine. It’s okay” (Tr. at 6). The Immigration Judge then asked respondent’s counsel if he accepted that as a waiver, and respondent’s counsel replied in the affirmative. Id. The Immigration Judge noted at the bottom of his memorandum decision that both parties waived appeal. The respondent asserts on appeal that his waiver of appeal was unknowing and requests a remand. While the respondent submitted an affidavit on appeal, his only statement regarding the waiver is that counsel did not preserve his appeal rights. The respondent does not state that he did not understand that he was waiving appeal when he, his counsel, and the Immigration Judge discussed the issue. Although the respondent claims that his former counsel was ineffective, this claim is unavailing. To establish a meritorious ineffective assistance of counsel claim, an alien must first comply with the procedural requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). See Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000). Here, the respondent has failed to comply with the requirements that he inform former counsel of the allegations he is lodging against him, as well as notify the state bar disciplinary authority. Furthermore, he has not established a factual basis on which we could conclude that the former counsel was ineffective, and he has not established any prejudice from the asserted ineffective assistance of counsel.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed as waived.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to remand is denied.

APPLICATION: Reopening
 
This case was last before us on August 27, 2010, when we denied the respondent’s motion to reopen as untimely. On September 27, 20010, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider our denial of his motion to reopen. The motion to reconsider will be denied, and the respondent’s stay request also is denied.
 
A motion to reconsider is “a request that the Board reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change in law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked.” Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 57 (BIA 2006). A motion to reconsider challenges the Board’s original decision and alleges that it is defective in some regard. Id According to section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(6)(C), a motion to reconsider must specify the errors of fact or law in a prior Board decision, and it must be supported by pertinent authority. See section 240(c)(6)(C) of the Act; see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1).
 
The respondent’s motion does not meet these requirements. Specifically, the respondent has not identified an error of fact or law in our prior ruling. The respondent instead has offered additional information regarding the merits and progress of the post-conviction motion he has filed in his criminal proceedings. To the extent that the respondent’s motion contains new evidence for consideration, the motion is a motion to reopen. See Matter of O-S-G-, supra, at 57-58. The respondent, however, has already filed one motion to reopen, and his current motion was filed well past the time limit for filing a motion to reopen. The motion to reopen therefore is untimely and numerically barred. See sections 240(c)(7)(A) and (C)(i) of the Act.
 
*2 In addition, the respondent has not established that his motion fits within one of the exceptions to the time and number limits. See sections 240(c)(7)(C)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of the Act; see also 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(3)(i) - (iv). Moreover, as we noted in our prior decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen, the respondent has not claimed that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel during his immigration proceedings. See Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding that the deadline for motions to reopen may be equitably tolled on the basis of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel provided the alien acts with due diligence); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (setting forth requirements for establishing entitlement to reopening on the basis of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).
 
Finally, the respondent has not established that sua sponte reopening of his proceedings is warranted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997) (indicating that this Board may grant sua sponte reopening in its discretion when exceptional circumstances exist). The respondent claims that he was denied due process due to his criminal attorney’s failure to consider and advise him of the immigration consequences of his guilty pleas. The respondent argues that the guilty pleas made him removable and ineligible for relief from removal, and he asserts that a criminal court is on the verge of overturning his convictions on the basis of Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010). He therefore claims that his proceedings should be reopened and stayed so that he may pursue relief from removal and avoid irreparable harm.
 
The respondent’s assertion that some or all of his convictions might be invalidated in the near future, however, does not alter the fact that his convictions are final for immigration purposes unless and until they are actually overturned by a criminal court. See, e.g., Matter of Ponce de Leon-Ruiz, 21 I&N Dec. 154, 156-7 (BIA 1996) (finding that the availability of post-conviction motions or other forms of collateral attack does not affect the finality of a conviction for immigration purposes); see also Montilla v. INS, 926 F.2d 162, 164 (2d Cir. 1991). Neither this Board nor the Immigration Judge has jurisdiction to consider a collateral attack on a conviction or to question the validity of a final conviction. See, e.g., Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996). Accordingly, as we stated in our earlier ruling, the respondent’s assertion that his convictions could be overturned in the near future, standing alone, does not provide a proper basis for granting his untimely motion to reopen. We therefore deny the respondent’s motion to reconsider, and we deny what we have construed to constitute a motion to reopen as untimely.
 
*3 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: To the extent that the respondent’s motion to reconsider also constitutes a motion to reopen, it is denied as untimely.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s stay request is denied.

File: AXXX XX2 437 - New York, NY
October 28, 2010
 
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Hedwin Salmen-Navarro, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Motion to reopen
 
In a decision dated May 12, 2010, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s untimely motion to reopen removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia on April 2, 2008. The respondent has appealed. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is a 26-year-old native and citizen of Honduras. He entered the United States on or about February 1993. The Notice to Appear was issued on January 22, 2007. He did not appear at the hearing on April 2, 2008, despite having been in court when the hearing date was set. The respondent filed a motion to rescind the in absentia order and to reopen proceedings on May 3, 2010, over 2 years after the hearing, in order to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen for lack of prejudice and lack of due diligence. The Board denied his request for a stay. The respondent was removed on July 12, 2010.
 
Under the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(d), a motion to reopen shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of exclusion, deportation or removal proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States. In Matter of Armendarez-Mendez, 24 I&N Dec. 646 (BIA 2008), the Board found that a motion to reopen is barred by the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2, and the Immigration Judge and the Board do not have jurisdiction over the motion, where the alien has left the United States after he is placed into immigration proceedings. Xue Yong Zhang v. Holder, 617 F.3d 650 (2d Cir. 2010) (departure bar limits Board’s sua sponte jurisdiction over motion to reopen); see Ovalles v. Holder, 577 F.3d 288 (5th Cir. 2009).
 
In Matter of Bulnes-Nolasco, 25 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 2009), the Board held an alien could file a motion to rescind an in absentia order of exclusion, deportation, or removal to address whether an alien received sufficient notice of an in absentia deportation hearing. See Xue Yong Zhang, supra, at 8 n. 10 (distinguishing Bulnes-Nolasco). Under the statute, an order of removal can be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed at any time, if the alien demonstrated that he did not receive notice. See Contreras-Rodriguez v. United States Attorney General, 462 F.3d 1314 (11th Cir. 2006); 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The Immigration Judge found the respondent received sufficient notice because he was present when the hearing date was set. Further, he did not explain why he did not appear on April 4, 2008, if he thought that was the correct hearing date, and he did not exercise due diligence in filing a motion to reopen 2 years after the Immigration Judge’s decision.¿FN1º
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent argues that he has shown exceptional circumstances prevented him from appearing in that he was subject to ineffective assistance of counsel. He submitted evidence that the organization for which his attorney worked, the International Professional Association, has been sued by the State of New York for fraud and malfeasance. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). He also states he has a mental deficiency as the result of a car accident. However, a motion to rescind on account of exceptional circumstances must be filed within 180 days of the Immigration Judge’s order. Section 240(b)(5)(c)(i) and 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(b)(5)(c)(i) and (e)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). The respondent has not complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, supra, and he has not shown due diligence. See e.g. Rashid v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 127 (2d Cir. 2008) (no due diligence); Wang v. Bill, 508 F.3d 710 (2d Cir. 2007) (same); Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167 (2d Cir. 2006) (same).
 
Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

The motion does not contain an affidavit or statement from the respondent regarding these events. To the extent that the respondent has concerns over his memory, he has not shown what steps he took to clarify the hearing date, and hence has not made a case that his failure to attend resulted from circumstances “beyond the control of the alien.” Section 240(e)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stephen Coghlan, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated September 15, 2009. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s timely motion to reopen proceedings. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not demonstrate that he received ineffective assistance of counsel or that proceedings should be reopened in order to permit the respondent to apply for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b). On appeal, the respondent argues that he is prima facie eligible for cancellation of removal and requests that his proceedings be remanded to the Immigration Judge. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed.
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
As an initial matter, we note that we do not consider evidence first offered on appeal as our review is a review of the record created before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of Federenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984). The proper time to submit evidence is before an Immigration Judge at an evidentiary hearing. We note that where evidence is new or previously unavailable it may support a remand. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(c)(1) and 1003.2(c)(4). Since the evidence submitted by the respondent could have been submitted with his motion to reopen, we find that remand is not warranted in this matter. Hence, we will consider the respondent’s appeal based upon the evidence in the record at the hearing before the Immigration Judge.
 
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s motion to reopen did not demonstrate that the respondent’s removal proceedings should be reopened in order to allow the respondent to pursue an application for cancellation of removal. The respondent’s motion was not supported by the proper documentation to establish the respondent’s prima facie eligibility, where the respondent did not submit an application for cancellation of removal or evidence of continuous physical presence, good moral character, absence of a disqualifying conviction, and the requisite hardship to a qualifying relative. Furthermore, the respondent’s motion did not demonstrate that he received ineffective assistance at his hearing before the Immigration Judge. In light of the foregoing, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s denial of the respondent’s motion to reopen. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sherna G. Spencer, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a female native and citizen of Jamaica, has appealed the Immigration Judge’s decision dated October 2, 2009, denying the respondent’s motion to reconsider. The Immigration Judge had previously ordered the respondent removed in absentia on April 15, 2009, and in a decision dated August 27, 2009, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, are reviewed de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
 
Upon de novo review, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s determination that the respondent has not established that proceedings should be reopened. There is no issue regarding whether the respondent knew that she had a scheduled removal hearing. Thus, the respondent had notice of her hearing and can seek reopening of proceedings solely upon the basis of exceptional circumstances. See section 240(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). In this case, the respondent claims that she failed to appear because she mistakenly relied on the advice of an immigration consultant. However, the respondent does not claim that the consultant held herself out to be an attorney, nor does the respondent claim that she believed the consultant was an attorney. We therefore find that the respondent has not established exceptional circumstances for her failure to appear. See Hernandez v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 1014, 1020 (9th Cir. 2008) (noting that an alien’s knowing reliance on a non-attorney’s advice will not support a due process violation); Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, 327 F.3d 892, 897 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding that there is a crucial difference between ineffective assistance of counsel and ineffective assistance of an immigration consultant).
 
In addition, even if the respondent believed that the immigration consultant was an attorney or held herself out as such, her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel does not satisfy the procedural requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 514 F.3d 1224, 1225-26 (11th Cir. 2008) (suggesting that Lozada applies to ineffective assistance of counsel claims rendered by non-attorneys); Matter of Compean, Bangaly & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (A.G. 2009) (directing the Board and Immigration Judges to apply “the Lozada framework” to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel “pending the issuance of a final rule”). We therefore find no reason to disturb the decision of the Immigration Judge.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Sandra Echevarria, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, appeals from the Immigration Judge’s decision dated June 29, 2009, denying his motion to reopen proceedings so that he may pursue his application for adjustment of status, pursuant to a Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) filed by his United States citizen wife. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility made by the Immigration Judge, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2010). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008).
 
A motion to reopen will not be granted unless evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available or could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). The respondent argues that his new evidence is the Form I-130 filed by his wife, as well as his application for adjustment of status (Form I-485) (Respondent’s Br. at 3). However, as the respondent himself concedes, these documents were filed with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in 1997 (Respondent’s Br. at 3). He did not establish that this information was not available or could not have been presented at the hearing. Accordingly, we agree with the Immigration Judge’s decision to deny the motion to reopen.
 
The respondent argues that he has a “colorable claim” to ineffective assistance of counsel by the attorney who represented him before the Immigration Judge, because that attorney did not notify the Immigration Judge of the respondent’s eligibility for adjustment of status. However, the respondent chose not to comply with the procedural requirements for making a claim of ineffective assistance (Respondent’s Br. at 11-12; I.J. at 2). See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).
 
In his decision dated March 23, 2009, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent post-conclusion voluntary departure. The respondent requests that if the Board does not grant his motion to reopen, we alternatively reinstate the grant of voluntary departure, or order his bond returned to him. As the respondent acknowledges, a filing of a motion to reopen prior to the expiration of the period allowed for voluntary departure serves to automatically terminate the grant of voluntary departure. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1). Thus, we do not have discretion to reinstate voluntary departure. The previously-entered voluntary departure order will be vacated. Further, we do not have jurisdiction to order the return of the posted bond, as that is in the purview of the Department of Homeland Security. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(c)(4).
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge’s order granting voluntary departure, dated March 23, 2009, is vacated, and the alternative order of removal is in effect.

CERTIFICATION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Timothy L. Cook, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Remand
  
ORDER:
 
*1 We accept the respondent’s appeal on certification because he has satisfactorily demonstrated that his prior counsel did not mail him a copy of the Immigration Judge’s written decision in time to file a timely appeal. The respondent has filed a motion to remand the record to the Immigration Judge for a new evidentiary hearing based on a claim that he was also provided ineffective assistance of counsel at his hearing before the Immigration Judge. The Department of Homeland Security did not file an appeal brief or a response to the motion to remand. We therefore deem the respondent’s request for a new hearing to be unopposed. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). The respondent has substantially complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).
 
The record supports the respondent’s argument that his prior counsel was unprepared to address the lodged charged of removability under section 212(a)(9)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(9)(C), and that she had not adequately prepared the respondent for the hearing (Tr. at 6). See generally Mai v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 162 (5th Cir. 2006). The DHS stated at the August 12, 2008, hearing its intention to file the section 212(a)(9)(C) charge, yet counsel appeared to be ill equipped to address it at the subsequent hearing more than a year later. However, we also note that there is some question as to whether the DHS properly served written notice of the lodged charge (Form 1-261) to counsel’s correct address prior to the final hearing on September 15, 2009 (Tr. at 6, 8-12). See 8 C.F.R. 1240.10(e).
 
Upon consideration of the totality of the circumstances presented here, including the lack of an opposition from the DHS, we will grant the motion to remand. Accordingly, we grant the motion and remand the record to the Immigration Judge for a new hearing on the respondent’s removability and eligibility for relief.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Lawrence N. Etah, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The final administrative decision in this matter was entered by the Board on February 27, 2009, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. On March 16, 2010, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reopen, but urges that equitable tolling of the time limits is warranted because he received ineffective assistance of counsel from his prior attorneys, and from another person who held himself out to be an attorney. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion. The motion will be granted.
 
We find that the respondent has established that equitable tolling of the motion time limits is warranted in this case. Cecik v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2000). His motion complies with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (Motion, tabs 2 & 3), and establishes that he has been prejudiced by attorney Arthur Wemegah’s actions.¿FN1º Specifically, the respondent presents evidence that a visa petition filed by his current wife was approved in November 2008, while his appeal was still pending with the Board (Motion, tab 7). A copy of this decision was sent to attorney Wemegah, who was representing the respondent before the Board (Motion, tab 7). Attorney Wemegah, however, did not file a motion to remand with the Board requesting that the respondent be allowed to apply for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a). Nor, after the Board issued its February 2009 decision, did attorney Wemegah file a timely motion to reopen or advise the respondent of the need to file such a motion within 90 days of the Board’s decision. Had such a motion been filed, it would likely have been granted, since the visa petition had already been approved, and the respondent appears prima facie eligible for adjustment of status.
 
The respondent has also demonstrated his diligence in raising this claim. He presents evidence that after his appeal was dismissed, he sought further representation. The person with whom he consulted held himself out to be an attorney and advised the respondent to file an adjustment application with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which the respondent did in August 2009 (Motion, tab 7). It was only after he was later detained by the USCIS and received a notice advising him that the adjustment application would not be processed due to the outstanding removal order that he discovered this person was not an attorney and sought out new counsel.
 
*2 Under the circumstances, we find the respondent has demonstrated that equitable tolling of the motions time limit is warranted, and we will grant the motion to reopen to allow the respondent an opportunity to apply for adjustment of status based on his marriage to a United States citizen, on the basis of which a visa petition has been approved.¿FN2º
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

Although the respondent presents claims against other prior attorneys and a non-attorney, we need only address the claims against attorney Wemegah, who represented him at the last two hearings below and on appeal to the Board.

2

A self-petition as a battered spouse (Form I-360) was also approved by the USCIS on the respondent’s behalf in May 2010 (Supplemental Submission, attachment). It is not entirely clear whether this petition relates to his current marriage or his prior marriage. In either event, it appears the respondent has a visa immediately available to him, whether based on the approved I-130 or the approved I-360.

Appeal
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
David K.S. Kim, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondents in this matter consist of a mother (AXXX XXX XXX) and her two children (AXXX XXX XXX and 952), all natives and citizens of South Korea.¿FN1º The respondent timely appeals a July 22, 2008, decision by the Immigration Judge which granted the respondent’s motion to withdraw voluntary departure, but denied reopening his February 26, 2008, decision, which granted voluntary departure, with an alternate order of removal. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2009). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
In his February 26, 2008, decision, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent a period of voluntary departure to June 25, 2008. The respondent filed motions to withdraw voluntary departure and to reopen on June 24, 2008, i.e., within the voluntary departure time allotted. Thus, under Dada v. Mukasey, 554 U.S. 1 (2008), the Immigration Judge was correct in granting the respondent’s motion to withdraw voluntary departure (I.J. at 3).
 
However, the respondent’s motion to reopen was filed more than 90 days after the Immigration Judge’s February 26, 2008, decision, and was thus untimely. See section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The respondent asserts that the motion to reopen is not untimely because her order of removal did not become final until her voluntary departure time expired on June 25, 2008 (Respondent’s Brief at 8). However, she has provided no authority for this argument and we decline to accept it. See Matter of Goolcharan, 23 I&N Dec. 5 (BIA 2001).¿FN2º
 
The respondent asserts that even though her motion was untimely, the time limitation for filing it was equitably tolled because she was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel and prejudiced thereby (Motion to Reopen at 2-4; Exh. A of Motion to Reopen; Respondent’s Brief at 8-10). She filed four different adjustment of status applications, all of which were denied by USCIS. Her most recent application was denied on November 23, 2007, because she had not been out of a valid nonimmigrant status for 180 days or less, as required by Section 245(k) of the Act (Exh. G of Motion to Reopen). She was represented by Sae-Jung Lee of You & Associates at the time of her most recent adjustment of status application, and alleges that he did not inform her that she could challenge the USCIS finding before the Immigration Court. She was thereafter represented by Shinyun Ki of You & Associates, and claims that Ms. Ki did not explain all of the respondent’s options available to her when she took voluntary departure in February 2008. However, in claiming ineffective assistance of counsel against Mr. Lee and Ms. Ki, the respondent has not complied with any of the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); aff’d, Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988) (I.J. at 3-4; Respondent’s Brief at 8-10).
 
*2 Even if timely, we agree that the respondent’s motion to reopen did not specify which new facts would be proven at his hearing (I.J. at 4). The governing regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3) require that a motion to reopen “state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted.” The respondent did not comply with this requirement, and therefore her request to reopen was appropriately denied.
 
We disagree with the respondent’s contention that pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.11(a)(2) the Immigration Judge should have informed the respondent that she qualified for adjustment of status (Respondent’s Brief at 11-12). As the Immigration Judge pointed out, the respondent did not show she would be eligible to adjust status (I.J. at 4). The respondent alleges that she is eligible to adjust status because pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 245.2(a)(5)(ii), an alien in removal proceedings who renews her application for adjustment of status does not accrue unlawful presence. However, the regulation also states that an applicant does not need to meet the requirement of section 245(c) of the Act at the time of renewal of the application as long as the requirements were met at the time the renewed application was initially filed with the director. The requirements of section 245(c) of the Act were not met at the time the most recent renewed application was filed with the Director of the USCIS on July 5, 2007. In particular, section 245(k) of the Act, i.e., the subsection that the respondent is seeking to adjust status under and which is referenced in section 245(c)(2) of the Act, directs that an alien seeking to adjust status cannot have been out of valid nonimmigrant status for more than 180 days. As the respondent had been out of valid nonimmigrant status for more than 180 days at the time she filed her renewed application for adjustment of status, she was not eligible for adjustment of status and the Immigration Judge was correct not to inform her that she was eligible for adjustment of status.
 
Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Immigration Judge denying the motion to reopen and the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

We note that the claims of all three respondents rest upon the claim of the lead respondent. Therefore, we will refer to the lead respondent simply as “the respondent.”

Following the respondent’s logic, for example, would require that the Board accept appeals filed within 30 days after the expiration of a grant of voluntary departure.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(E)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(E)(i)º - Alien smuggler
  
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals an Immigration Judge’s September 3, 2008, decision granting the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) motion to pretermit the respondent’s application for cancellation of removal and denying the respondent’s request to withdraw her pleadings to the Notice to Appear. We review the Immigration Judge’s factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The respondent’s fee waiver request is granted. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). The case will be remanded.
 
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by denying the respondent’s request to withdraw her pleadings. See Respondent’s Brief at 4-5. According to the respondent, the attorney who represented her before the Immigration Judge rendered ineffective assistance by filing an April 27, 2007, motion to change venue to the Cleveland Immigration Court in which the attorney admitted the factual allegations in the Notice to Appear and conceded that the respondent was removable for assisting an alien to enter the United States illegally. See section 212(a)(6)(E)(i) of the Act. According to the respondent, her prior attorney conceded removability without first consulting with the respondent. See Respondent’s Brief at 6; Motion to Change Venue. Moreover, the concession of removability left the respondent with no apparent means to avoid losing her permanent resident status, in that she was ineligible for cancellation of removal because, at the time of the service of the Notice to Appear, the respondent had not accrued 7 years of continuous residence in the United States. When the attorney realized that the respondent was not eligible for cancellation of removal, she attempted to withdraw the pleadings before the Immigration Judge (Tr. at 13).¿FN1º
 
Motions to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel are governed by our decision in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009). The respondent has not submitted an affidavit setting forth her agreement with former counsel, or filed a disciplinary complaint against former counsel. Nevertheless, we find substantial compliance with Lozada based on an affidavit from respondent’s former attorney.
 
*2 In this affidavit provided on appeal, the respondent’s prior attorney admitted that she conceded the respondent’s removability without first speaking to the respondent or discussing the factual allegations with the respondent. See Exh. 5 at 1. Further, given the egregiousness of the representation, we do not deem the attorney’s admission binding on the respondent. See Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986).
 
In sum, given the circumstances of this case, we will grant the respondent’s motion to reopen for ineffective assistance of counsel and remand this case for a hearing on the issue of the respondent’s removability and eligibility for relief from removal. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and the entry of a new decision.

At the hearing before the Immigration Judge, the respondent, through counsel, argued that “since we found out that we’re not eligible for cancellation of removal we’d like to now amend the pleadings and require that the state or the Government prove that the respondent is removable” (Tr. at 13).

ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Graciela G. Garza
Assistant District Counsel
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled
  
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
 
This case was last before us on February 3, 2010, when we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to rescind the in absentia order entered against him. On March 5, 2010, the respondent filed a timely motion to reconsider our ruling and a numerically-barred motion to reopen his proceedings to apply for asylum based on changed country conditions and changed circumstances. The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied. The respondent’s motion to reconsider will be granted, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order.
  
I. RESPONDENT’S MOTION TO REOPEN
 
The respondent originally sought to reopen his proceedings when he filed a motion to rescind the in absentia order entered against him and a motion to reopen to apply for asylum based on changed country conditions with the Immigration Judge on October 6, 2008. The respondent now has requested reopening again based on changed country conditions in Brazil and changed personal circumstances. The respondent’s current motion to reopen is numerically barred. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). And the respondent’s evidence does not establish that there has been a material change in conditions in his homeland of Brazil since the time of his hearing before the Immigration Judge such that he now is eligible for asylum.¿FN1º See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act.
 
In addition, even if we were to view the respondent’s motion as his first motion due to the Immigration Judge’s failure to address his claim of changed country conditions in her decision denying his original motion, the respondent has not met the general requirements for reopening. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c); see also Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Specifically, he has not presented sufficient evidence to establish that he is prima facie eligible for asylum. See Matter of Coelho, supra (stating that this Board may deny a motion to reopen where a prima facie case for the relief sought has not been established); see also Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 420 (1996)(discussing burden of establishing prima facie case for relief).
 
*2 The respondent claims to fear persecution at the hands of a human trafficker because the respondent testified against the trafficker in a criminal trial in the United States. The respondent, however, has not presented evidence from the criminal trial to support his assertion that the trafficker, who is Mexican, has extensive contacts in Brazil, and the respondent has not offered any information to suggest that the trafficker seeks to retaliate against him. More importantly, the respondent has not presented evidence to suggest that any possible targeting will occur on account of the respondent’s membership in a particular social group or on account of an imputed political opinion. See, e.g., Matter of C-A-, 23 I&N Dec. 951 (BIA 2006)(finding that group of former noncriminal drug informants working against the Cali drug cartel does not have the requisite social visibility to constitute a particular social group). The respondent’s statements instead indicate that any possible targeting will occur in retaliation for the respondent’s act of testifying.
 
Accordingly, the respondent has not presented sufficient evidence to indicate that he has a reasonable likelihood of succeeding on the merits of his asylum application so as to make it worthwhile to develop the issues further at a full evidentiary hearing. Matter of L-O-G-, supra. We therefore deny his motion to reopen.¿FN2º
  
II. MOTION TO RECONSIDER
 
On the other hand, we find that the respondent is entitled to reconsideration of our decision dismissing his appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision denying his motion to rescind the in absentia order entered against him. The respondent raised a claim of lack of notice of his hearing for the first time in his appeal before us.¿FN3º According to section 240(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act, a claim of lack of notice may be raised at any time. Moreover, because we cannot make factual findings on appeal, an Immigration Judge must consider this claim in the first instance. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Accordingly, we should have remanded the respondent’s case to the Immigration Judge for full consideration of his claimed lack of notice rather than making factual findings regarding his claim in our ruling. Because we did not do so, we vacate our decision dated February 3, 2010, and we remand the record to the Immigration Judge for consideration of the respondent’s motion to rescind the in absentia order entered against him based on lack of notice.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reconsider is granted, our decision dated February 3, 2010, is vacated, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order and for the entry of a new decision.

The respondent claims that his evidence shows that there has been a surge in violence in Brazil against the police and supporters of the police, but the evidence, in fact, shows that the criminal gangs in Brazil are engaging in an increasingly violent turf war and that the police are stepping up their attempts to control the gangs. See Respondent’s Motion to Reconsider and Reopen at 33 - 55. This evidence does not describe a change in conditions that is material to the respondent’s asylum application.

2

In denying the respondent’s motion to reopen to apply for asylum, we note that, if, on remand, the Immigration Judge determines that the respondent is entitled to rescission of the in absentia order entered against him, the respondent will have the opportunity to present an application for asylum and withholding of removal during his removal proceeding.

3

The respondent did make statements in the motion he filed before the Immigration Judge that are consistent with his claim of lack of notice, but he based the motion to rescind he filed with the Immigration Judge on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Diana E. Moller, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Marci Ellsworth
Senior Attorney
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen her removal proceedings. In our decision dated November 18, 2009, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision which found her removable, granted her motion to suppress, but denied her motion to terminate. The present motion will be granted.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen (filed on February 19, 2010) is timely.¿FN1º The respondent alleges ineffective assistance of former counsel (Rosaura Del Carmen Rodriguez). In Matter of Compean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General directed the Board to continue to apply the previously established standards for reviewing motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel (pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
The respondent shows substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to allege ineffective assistance of former counsel. The respondent presents her declaration and Ms. Rodriguez’s declaration. The respondent has not filed a complaint with the appropriate bar authorities. The respondent explains that it would not be fair because of the pressure the Immigration Judge allegedly put on Ms. Rodriguez to plead to the allegations in the Notice to Appear (Form I-862) at the August 28, 2006, master calendar hearing (Motion at 12-13). Although we do not consider the respondent’s explanation to be satisfactory, we decline, under the circumstances present in this case, to find this to be fatal to the respondent’s claim.
 
The respondent shows prejudice. See Morales Apolinar v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 893,898 (9th Cir. 2008) (prejudice is established when the performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings). The respondent hired Ms. Rodriguez to represent her (Motions Exhs. 1, 2). Ms. Rodriguez represented the respondent at her August 28, 2006, master calendar hearing and admitted the allegations in the Notice to Appear and conceded the charge of removability (Tr. at 3). The Immigration Judge granted the respondent’s motion to suppress but denied her motion to terminate. The only reason the Immigration Judge did not grant the respondent’s motion to terminate was because of Ms. Rodriguez’s admission of the allegations in the Notice to Appear and concession of removability (I.J. at 4-5; BIA at 2). We conclude that the respondent shows prejudice. Cf. Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 383 (BIA 1986) (finding that the admissions and the concession of deportability were reasonable tactical actions undertaken by former counsel in order to enhance the alien’s chances of securing favorable action on the motion for change of venue and were properly held to be binding upon the alien).
 
*2 In summary, we grant the respondent’s motion to reopen because she shows substantial compliance with the requirements in Matter of Lozada, supra, and shows prejudice. Because the respondent’s motion to reopen is timely filed, due diligence is not an issue.
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
 
Elizabeth C. Surin, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)º - Present without being admitted or paroled (both respondents)
  
APPLICATION: Reopening; remand
 
The respondents appeal from the Immigration Judge’s September 9, 2008, decision. The Immigration Judge had previously, on April 21, 2008, granted the respondents pre-conclusion voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(a), the respondents having waived their right of appeal. The respondents thereafter, on August 18, 2008, filed a motion to reopen. The Immigration Judge denied the respondents’ untimely filed motion to reopen, concluding that the claim did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel during the course of the removal proceedings so as to support reopening. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondents are husband and wife. The respondents’ current counsel, in the motion filed with the Immigration Judge, requested reopening based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. It was noted in the motion that the previous counsel, after failing to timely file an appeal from a previous denial by the Department of Homeland Security (the DHS) of an employment-based visa petition (I-140), not only failed to advise the lead respondent that he could file a new Application for Employment Certification, but then further prejudiced the interests of the respondents by requesting voluntary departure. In response to the motion, the prior counsel stated that, early in December 2007, after the I-140 was denied, the employer pulled out, and no appeal was filed with DHS as, with no employer support, there was no ability to challenge the denial on appeal. The prior counsel noted that, as the respondents had no eligibility for relief, they were advised that voluntary departure was the only sensible option.
 
The Immigration Judge, after noting on several occasions that the first attorney representing the respondents did not seem entirely familiar with immigration law, concluded that the respondents did not receive ineffective assistance from their former attorney, finding that the interests of the respondents were not prejudiced during the course of the removal proceedings. The Immigration Judge found that the failure by the former attorney to request a continuance does not represent a failure to request a form of relief. The Immigration Judge further noted that she had indicated on the record that she was not willing to a grant a continuance unless there was evidence that a timely appeal of the I-140 denial had been filed, and, as there was no such evidence, this explains why no such motion was filed by the previous attorney. The Immigration Judge further found that nothing done in the Immigration Court prevents the respondents from filing for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i), even if they are not in the United States. The Immigration Judge, noting that she has no jurisdiction over an Application for Employment Certification, found that there is no evidence that, without an approved visa petition, the respondents were prima facie eligible for any relief other than voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge, after denying the motion to reopen, vacated the grant of pre-conclusion voluntary departure under section 240B(a) of the Act.
 
*2 In the motion to reopen the respondents claim that previous counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Pursuant to Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), to pursue such a claim, the alien must lay out, in a detailed affidavit, the agreement between the alien and the representative; the alien must give the representative the opportunity to respond to the allegation of ineffectiveness; and the alien must file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority or adequately explain why no filing was made. Finally, to advance a successful claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must demonstrate a due process violation, that is, prejudice, i.e., he “must show that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.” Uspango v. Ashcroft, 289 F.3d 226, 231 (3d Cir. 2002); see also Xu Yong Lu v. Ashcroft, 259 F.3d 127, 131 (3d Cir.2001). The term “prejudice,” refers to actual prejudice. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). The degree of negligence that must be established for ineffectiveness is that counsel’s representation was so egregious that it rendered the hearing unfair. See Matter of B-B-, 22 I&N Dec. 309 (BIA 1998). The respondents have made no such showing. The respondents are clearly dissatisfied with former counsel’s representation because he failed in efforts to secure the approval of an employment based visa petition in proceedings before the DHS, but they have not shown that the hearing before the Immigration Judge was unfair or that, due to any alleged ineffective assistance of counsel during the course of the removal proceedings, they were prevented from reasonably presenting their case. See Balam-Chuc v. Mukasey, 547 F.3d 1044, 1050-51 (9th Cir. 2008).
 
The respondents’ principal allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel simply do not include any assertions of ineffective assistance of counsel during the course of these administrative proceedings before the Immigration Judge. Rather, the respondents’ arguments of ineffective assistance of counsel center on the lead respondent’s pursuit of his application for adjustment of status by way of an employment-based visa petition, difficulties over which we have no jurisdiction. The alleged ineffective assistance involved counsel who represented the respondents before the DHS, counsel who had been retained several years before these administrative proceeding were initiated by the issuance of the Notice to Appear in January 2008. It was only after the lead respondent’s application for adjustment of status by way of an employment-based visa petition was denied by the DHS, and no timely appeal was filed, that the respondents were left with limited options when they came before the Immigration Judge, albeit with the same counsel. If the respondents’ believe that, in pursuing a visa petition before the DHS, they are the victims of ineffective assistance of counsel, they must pursue this claim in a court of competent jurisdiction.
 
*3 The Immigration Judge weighed the evidence presented by the respondents and concluded that the factual assertions contained in the respondents’ motion were insufficient to reflect ineffective assistance on the part of former counsel during the course of the removal proceedings. The Immigration Judge’s factual determinations in this regard were not clearly erroneous within the meaning of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, North Carolina, 470 U.S. 564, 573-4 (1985) (holding that where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s choice between them cannot be deemed “clearly erroneous”). Furthermore, in light of the Immigration Judge’s factual determinations we find no reversible error in her legal conclusion that the respondent did not receive ineffective assistance from his former attorney during the course of the removal proceedings. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.
 
Thus, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The respondents’ appeal is dismissed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Arturo Suarez-Silverio, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 The respondent filed a timely motion to reopen on September 9, 2010, after the Board dismissed his appeal on August 24, 2010. The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) has not responded to the motion, which will be granted.
 
The respondent was found subject to removal based on a state drug conviction. Evidence is presented that, on August 30, 2010, a state court judge vacated the respondent’s guilty plea and sentence, and returned the matter to the “active court list”. Criminal counsel submitted a “Certification”, in which he states that the basis of the underlying motion “was ineffective assistance of counsel in that ¿counselº never advised Mr. Barros that his deportation was a consequence of the entry of his plea.” Also presented is the transcript of the August 25, 2010, “Post-Conviction Relief Hearing”, where the criminal court judge found that the respondent had made a “prima facie case” with regard to the argument that he received ineffective assistance of counsel concerning the immigration consequences of his guilty plea.
 
The Board finds that the uncontested evidence presented establishes that the underlying conviction which served as the basis for the respondent being subject to removal has been vacated due to a defect in the criminal proceeding. If a court with jurisdiction vacates a conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, the respondent no longer has a “conviction” within the meaning of section 101(a)(48)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § l101(a)(42)(A). See Matter of Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006)(conviction vacated pursuant to Ohio law for failure of the trial court to advise the alien defendant of the possible immigration consequences of a guilty plea is no longer a valid conviction for immigration purposes).
 
As the respondent is no longer subject to removal from the United States based upon the charge against him, removal proceedings against the respondent are terminated.

CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
 
Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)º - Convicted of aggravated felony (as defined in section 101 (a)(43)(B))
  
APPLICATION: Termination; waiver of inadmissibility; continuance
 
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge’s May 25, 2010, decision finding him removable from the United States, as charged. The respondent’s request for waiver of the appellate filing fee is granted. The respondent’s brief on appeal is accepted. The appeal will be dismissed.
 
The respondent is an approximately 59-year-old native and citizen of Trinidad & Tobago and a lawful permanent resident of the United States who entered the United States on November 28, 1971. He has one sister who is a United States citizen. According to the record, the respondent was convicted in the Criminal Court, Bronx County, New York, on July 22, 1999, of criminal possession of a controlled substance (cocaine) in the 7th degree in violation of section 220.03 of the New York State Penal law. He was sentenced to time served. His motion to vacate the judgment of conviction was denied by the Bronx County Criminal Court on March 29, 2010, because he had failed to show prejudice. He was convicted on April 11, 1985, in Criminal Court, City of New York, Kings County, New York, of criminal sale of marihuana in the 4th degree in violation of section 221.40 of the New York State Penal law. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail. He was convicted on February 16, 1983, in the Supreme Court, Kings County, New York, of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the 4th degree in violation of section 220.34 of the New York State Penal law (Exhs. 2, 10). Tr. at 75-80. The respondent does not dispute the existence of the convictions, but he claims he can waive the pre-1996 convictions under former section 212(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), and the 1999 conviction under section 212(h) of the Act 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h). The Department of Homeland Security (the “DHS”) maintains he is not eligible for either waiver. He also maintains the Immigration Judge should have granted him a continuance to have his 1999 conviction vacated under Padilla v. Kentucky, ___ U.S. ___, 130 S. Ct. 1473(2010). His sister and a niece testified on his behalf.
 
*2 We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent’s convictions render the respondent removable from the United States as an alien convicted of an “aggravated felony,” namely, illicit trafficking in a controlled substance, based on his 1983 and 1985 convictions. He also has a 1999 possession of a controlled substance conviction which renders him removable. Sections 101(a)(43)(B) and 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(B) and 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i).
 
The burden is on the respondent to show he is eligible for relief. Section 240(c)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4). The respondent appears to meet the statutory requirements for a waiver of his 1983 and his 1985 controlled substance convictions. See Matter of Arreguin, 21 I&N Dec. 38 (BIA 1995). However, he could not apply for a waiver under former 212(c) of the Act for his 1999 conviction, because by that time section 212(c) had been removed from the Act. The record of his 1999 conviction does not support a waiver under section 212(h) of the Act for possession of a small amount of marihuana, the only controlled substance waiver allowed under section 212(h). See Matter of Martinez-Zapata, 24 I&N Dec. 424 (BIA 2007). The respondent claims he was convicted in 1999 only of possession of a marihuana pipe. It is his burden to prove his contention. Moreover, he does not have a qualifying relative who would suffer extreme hardship as needed for relief under section 212(h) of the Act.
 
The respondent states the Immigration Judge erred because he did not grant him a continuance until the New York State court decided his second motion to vacate his conviction. The Immigration Judge did grant him two continuances to await results in his state court case. He declined to grant another continuance. An Immigration Judge may grant a continuance in his discretion for good cause shown. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.29, 1240.6. The respondent has not shown good cause. The Immigration Judge did not err in failing to continue the hearing so that the state court could vacate the conviction. See generally Matter of Hashmi, 24 I&N Dec. 785 (BIA 2009).
 
Generally, a request for a continuance to obtain collateral relief does not demonstrate good cause. Paredes v. Attorney General, 528 F.3d 196 (3d Cir. 2008); Grageda v. INS, 12 F.3d 919 (9th Cir. 1993). The respondent claims ineffective assistance of counsel in that he allegedly was not informed of the immigration consequences of his conviction. See Padilla v. Kentucky, supra (counsel may provide ineffective assistance to a criminal defendant by failing to advise him of the possibility of deportation as the result of a guilty plea). This is the same claim made in the previous motion to vacate, which was denied by the state court
 
*3 A conviction is final for immigration purposes despite a collateral attack. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A). The respondent’s 1999 conviction is final, and it constitutes a valid predicate for his removal unless and until it is overturned by a court of competent jurisdiction. The record does not indicate that his conviction has been overturned. Therefore, the respondent’s conviction was properly considered in these proceedings.
 
Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

File: AXXX XX9 431 - Los Angeles, CA

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Claire H. Kim, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Julia C. Contreras
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 This case was last before the Board on December 21, 2004, when the Board affirmed, without opinion, an Immigration Judge’s decision denying the respondent’s motion to reopen her removal proceedings that were conducted in absentia on May 22, 2001. On August 4, 2010, the respondent, a native and citizen of Thailand, filed a motion requesting reopening. The motion will be denied.¿FN1º
 
With certain exceptions not pertinent here, the respondent is limited to one motion to reopen and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). The respondent’s motion to reopen is therefore barred by the time limitations applicable to motions.
 
However, even if considered timely, the respondent, who altogether failed to raise both her alleged lack of notice and ineffective assistance of counsel claims before both the Immigration Judge and the Board on appeal, has not sufficiently shown that such claims could not have been discovered or presented during the former proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c). Significantly, the respondent consistently and only asserted, before both the Immigration Judge and the Board, that she failed to attend her scheduled hearing because her “son became ill” (Resp. Brief on Appeal filed July 19, 2004; Resp. Brief dated March 30, 2004; Resp. Brief dated June 22, 2001). Further, the Immigration Judge noted that, even if the respondent’s motion was timely filed, no explanation for the delay was offered (I.J. at 1-2).
 
Under the circumstances, we do not find the respondent’s assertions, the alleged non receipt of the Notice to Appear and the ineffective assistance of her former counsel in connection with the untimely filings of both her motions before the Immigration Judge and the Board, alone sufficient to demonstrate patent error or prejudice. See, e.g., Joshi v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 732, 735 (7th Cir. 2004) (stating that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving, denial of receipt, even if sworn, is weak evidence”); see also Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003); Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56, 58 (BIA 2006) (stating that a motion to reconsider based on a legal argument that could have been raised earlier in the proceedings will be denied). Nor has the respondent sufficiently complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, supra. See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process).
 
*2 Finally, we find no other reason for this Board’s further consideration of the respondent’s claim on our own motion pursuant to this Board’s sua sponte authority under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a). On this record, the respondent has provided us with no reason to overlook her untimely motion. Accordingly, we will enter the following order.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

The respondent has been removed from the United States to Thailand. In Coyt v. Holder, 593 F.3d 902 (9th Cir. 2010), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Board may not find a motion withdrawn by operation of law, when the respondent is removed prior to the Board’s ruling on the motion. The motion is not, therefore, barred by reason of the respondent’s removal.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Rhonda McCauley, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 On August 26, 2010, the respondent filed a “motion to reopen/reconsider sua sponte” the Board’s May 7, 2010, decision dismissing his appeal. He also seeks a stay of removal. The motion and stay request are denied.
 
Whether treated as a motion to reopen or one seeking reconsideration, the respondent’s motion is untimely. Sections 240(c)(6), (7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229a(c)(6), (7); 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.2(b), (c)(2). Although the respondent avers that two unidentified attorneys provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel, he has not complied with any of the requirements for reopening on this basis. Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent’s reference to Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010) is unavailing as he has provided no evidence that he has filed any collateral attack against his criminal conviction, nor shown that the same has been successful. To the extent that he avers error in his underlying criminal conviction, the Board cannot go behind a record of conviction to assess its validity. Matter of Roberts, 20 I&N Dec. 294, 301 (BIA 1991). Moreover, while he now seeks to pursue an application for asylum and related relief, he has not shown that such a claim could not have been presented at the time of the proceedings below. Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N Dec. 399 (BIA 1991); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c).
 
We recognize and appreciate the many letters written by friends and family in support of the respondent’s motion. However, the facts presented do not represent exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of our discretionary authority to sua sponte reopen proceedings.¿FN1º Therefore, the respondent’s request for a stay of removal is moot. The motion is denied.

Should the respondent satisfy the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance against former counsel and/or show that his conviction has been vacated pursuant to Padilla or another basis that supports reopening, he may seek sua sponte reopening before this Board. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Aroon Roy Padharia, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration
  
ORDER:
 
*1 The motion is denied.¿FN1º The respondent, a native and citizen of Canada, has timely filed a motion requesting reconsideration of the Board’s June 11, 2010, decision dismissing the respondent’s appeal of an Immigration Judge’s decision finding the respondent removable as an aggravated felon, as charged, and ineligible for adjustment of status. To the extent the respondent’s motion rests on previously raised issues related to (a) his removability as an aggravated felon based on the validity of his convictions, (b) whether his conviction for the offense of malicious wounding in violation of Virginia Code § 18.2-51, constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude thereby rendering him inadmissible and thus ineligible for adjustment of status, and (c) his eligibility for a section 212(h) waiver of inadmissibility, the respondent has not identified any issue that was not considered in the Board’s previous detailed decision, nor has he identified any error of fact or law in that decision which would alter the outcome. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b); see also Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006) (discussing the requirements for motions to reconsider). Similarly, the respondent has not identified any error in the Board’s decision to review the respondent’s appeal without a brief filed by the respondent’s attorney. As the Board previously concluded, the arguments contained in the Notice of Appeal were sufficient to enable meaningful appellate review (Board order dated June 11, 2010, at 2). To the extent the respondent claims ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with his counsel’s failure to file a brief on appeal, the respondent has not sufficiently shown patent error or complied with the requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See also Matter of Compean, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009) (directing Board to apply Lozada standards to ineffective assistance of counsel claims pending the outcome of a rulemaking process); Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553 (BIA 2003). Accordingly, the respondent’s motion is denied.¿FN2º

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Peter N. Macaluso, Esquire
 
CHARGE:
 
*1 Notice: Sec. 237(a)(1)(G)(ii), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(G)(ii)º - Marriage fraud - failed or refused to fulfill marital agreement
 
Sec. 237(a)(1)(B), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B)º - In the United States in violation of law
  
APPLICATION: Removability
 
On August 26, 2008, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged. The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic, now appeals. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.
 
On appeal, the respondent challenges the Immigration Judge’s finding that he conceded the marriage fraud charge set forth in the Notice to Appear (Respondent’s Br. at 4-6). See section 237(a)(1)(G)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(G)(ii). He also asserts that his due process rights were violated because the Immigration Judge did not require the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to prove that charge¿FN1º (Respondent’s Br. at 4, 6). We review the factual findings in this case for clear error, and matters of law, judgment, and discretion under the de novo standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii) (2010).
 
The procedural history of this case raises significant concerns, particularly with respect to the Immigration Judge’s decision to sustain the marriage fraud charge. First, the Notice to Appear charges marriage fraud on the basis of entering into a marriage with a United States citizen for the purpose of procuring admission as an immigrant (Exh. 1). However, the notice only identifies a non-immigrant B2 visa admission, on October 6, 1998, as the respondent’s sole admission. The record indicates that the respondent married on August 26, 2006, but the notice does not indicate that the respondent adjusted his immigration status subsequent to his 1998 admission (Record of Sworn Statement of Leola Bernice Clark, dated August 7, 2007; Exh. 1).
 
Second, while the record contains a sworn statement of the United States citizen seeking to withdraw an I-130 visa petition because her marriage to the respondent was “fake,” the record does not contain an adjustment application or other document to indicate that the respondent sought an immigration benefit (Record of Sworn Statement of Leola Bernice Clark, dated August 7, 2007, at 1). Perhaps more importantly, section 237(a)(1)(G) of the Act pertains to aliens who “hav¿eº procured a visa or other documentation by fraud.” At most, the current record may indicate that the respondent sought to procure a visa or other documentation by fraud, but that does not suffice to sustain a charge under section 237(a)(1)(G).
 
*2 Third, after the respondent’s counsel conceded the charges set forth in the Notice to Appear, the respondent testified that he married his United States citizen wife because he loved her (Respondent’s Br. at 2, 4, 5; Tr. at 21, 27-28). The Immigration Judge told counsel that she should not have conceded the marriage fraud charge if the respondent planned to contest it (Tr. at 21, 29-30). Although the Immigration Judge gave the respondent and counsel an opportunity to discuss the matter, the Immigration Judge only asked for confirmation that the respondent had already conceded the charges, and not whether, in light of his testimony, he still wished to concede removability based on marriage fraud (Respondent’s Br. at 3, 5; Tr. at 32). The record does not indicate that the respondent recanted his testimony (Respondent’s Br. at 3).
 
Thus, we conclude that the record does not sufficiently support a finding that the respondent was removable on the grounds of marriage fraud. The Immigration Judge erred in sustaining the charge under section 237(a)(1)(G)(ii) on the basis of the record as it now exists. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii), 1240.10(c).
 
The respondent also asserts that he did not authorize his counsel to concede the marriage fraud charge, especially in light of his testimony that he married for love (Respondent’s Br. at 3). This assertion essentially raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Nevertheless, the potential ineffectiveness, combined with the above-described procedural deficiencies and the questionable nature of the marriage fraud count, lead us to conclude that a remand is warranted. Our remand does not preclude the DHS from endeavoring to prove the marriage fraud charge through the introduction of additional evidence into the record.
 
We also note that counsel withdrew the respondent’s request for voluntary departure when the Immigration Judge suggested that she would not grant it because the DHS opposed voluntary departure on the basis of the marriage fraud charge (Tr. at 30, 33). On remand, the respondent shall be given an opportunity to seek any relief for which he currently may be eligible, including voluntary departure.
 
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
 
Board Member Roger A. Pauley respectfully dissents and would not find this a patent case of ineffective assistance of counsel so as to excuse the failure to comply with Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Frank Murray, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Jorge L. Pereira
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent moves the Board pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 to reopen her removal proceedings. In our decision dated April 8, 2010, we dismissed the respondent’s appeal from the Immigration Judge’s decision which found her removable and determined that she was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents. The motion will be granted.
 
The respondent’s motion to reopen (filed on May 25, 2010) is timely. The respondent moves to reopen proceedings to apply for relief under former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1995). The respondent alleges ineffective assistance of former counsel (Bryant Filomeno). In Matter of Compean, Bangaly, & J-E-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 1 (A.G. 2009), vacating 24 I&N Dec. 710 (A.G. 2009), the Attorney General directed the Board to continue to apply the previously established standards for reviewing motions to reopen based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel (pending the outcome of a rulemaking process). The respondent meets the requirements in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), to allege ineffective assistance of former counsel. The respondent presents her affidavit, counsel’s letter to Mr. Filomeno, and a copy of the complaint filed against Mr. Filomeno.
 
The respondent shows prejudice. See generally Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 563 (BIA 2003) (finding that the alien had failed to show the requisite prejudice to warrant consideration of his late appeal). Mr. Filomeno filed an application for cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents on the respondent’s behalf, even though she was ineligible for such relief. See our April 8, 2010, decision. Mr. Filomeno did not file an application for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act on the respondent’s behalf, even though she appeared to be prima facie eligible to apply for such relief.
 
The respondent became a lawful permanent resident on September 29, 1989 (Exh. 1), so she had 7 years of lawful domicile in the United States as of September 29, 1996. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1212.3(f)(1) and (2) (2004) (section 212(c) applications shall be denied if the alien has not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence or the alien has not maintained lawful domicile in the United States for 7 years). The respondent pled nolo contendere to two counts of aggravated child abuse on July 17, 1995 (Exh. 2). See 8 C.F.R. § 1212.3(h)(1) (even if an alien is in removal proceedings, an eligible alien may apply for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act, without regard to the AEDPA, with respect to a conviction if the alien pleaded guilty or nolo contendere and the alien’s plea agreement was made before April 24, 1996). The respondent was thus eligible to apply for section 212(c) relief. We will therefore grant the respondent’s motion to reopen and remand for further proceedings. Our remand order is limited to allowing the respondent to apply for relief under former section 212(c) of the Act.
 
*2 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the proceedings are reopened.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.¿FN1º

A request for humanitarian parole or deferred action arising from the recent devastating earthquake in Haiti and its aftermath are matters beyond the jurisdiction of the Board and the Immigration Judges. See Matter of Medina, 19 I&N Dec. 734 (BIA 1988); Matter of Quintero, 18 I&N Dec. 348 (BIA 1982). However, a statement released by the Department of Homeland Security on January 13, 2010, reflects that “all removals to Haiti ¿have been haltedº for the time being in response to the devastation caused by ¿theº earthquake.” Further, the Secretary of Homeland Security has announced that Haitians who have continuously resided in the United States since January 12, 2010, and have been continuously physically present since January 21, 2010, may be granted Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”). See 75 Fed. Reg. 39,957-58 (July 13, 2010). Jurisdiction over applications for TPS by aliens under final orders of removal is with the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and TPS applications must be filed with the USCIS. See 8 C.F.R. § 1244.7. Please contact the Department of Homeland Security for any additional questions you may have regarding how to apply for TPS (1-800-375-5283 or www.uscis.gov).

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Richard I. Newman
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed from the June 8, 2010, decision of the Immigration Judge denying her motion to reopen her removal proceedings conducted in absentia on August 25, 2005. The appeal will be dismissed. The respondent’s request for a fee waiver is granted.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
We conclude that the respondent has not established that proceedings should be reopened. The respondent claims in her first motion to reopen, filed through former counsel, that she never received notice of her immigration hearing date. The Immigration Judge correctly determined in his May 19, 2010, decision that the respondent received proper notice. An Immigration Judge must order an alien removed in absentia if an alien fails to appear for a hearing after written notice has been provided to the alien through service of a notice to appear (NTA) containing the hearing time and date. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665, 670 (BIA 2008). The respondent was personally served an NTA on July 17, 2005, as evidenced by her signature and fingerprint (Exh. 1). The NTA establishes that the respondent was informed, orally and in writing, of the date and time of her next hearing on August 25, 2005 (Exh. 1).
 
The respondent argues in her second motion to reopen, filed pro se, that her former counsel was ineffective for failing to include an application for relief with the motion to reopen as required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). One of the grounds upon which an applicant may base a motion to reopen is ineffective assistance of counsel. To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must prove that he or she was prejudiced by the attorney’s substandard performance. United States v. Herrera, 412 F.3d 577, 580 (5th Cir. 2005). The respondent has not shown prejudice because she has not shown that her attorney’s performance caused her failure to appear at removal proceedings. The respondent did not retain the former attorney until 2010, and the claim of ineffectiveness is unrelated to the respondent’s failure to appear in 2005.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s appeal is dismissed.

APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
O. Joseph Taiwo, Esquire
 
APPLICATION: Termination
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Jamaica, appeals from the April 19, 2010, decision of the Immigration Judge which denied the respondent’s requests for a continuance and for termination, found the respondent subject to removal as charged and ordered him removed.¿FN1º The appeal will be dismissed.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) and (iii); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
The respondent was charged with removability under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) as one convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude based on his April 7, 1999, conviction for the offense of possession to distribute Class D substance, marijuana in violation of chapter 94C, section 32C of the General Laws of Massachusetts. On appeal as at his hearing, the respondent claimed such conviction was invalid because he was not advised either by the Court or his attorney of the immigration consequences of his plea. He contended that he therefore received ineffective assistance of counsel in the criminal matter and he requested a continuance to reopen the criminal matter. The Immigration Judge denied the continuance request and found the respondent subject to removal. On appeal the respondent submitted a copy of the decision by the Brighton District Court, Brighton, Massachusetts denying his motion to reopen the criminal matter. On appeal the respondent asserts that he has appealed that decision and he cites Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010) in support of his case.
 
The Immigration Judge correctly found the respondent subject to removal and found no merit in his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, even though former counsel in the criminal matter submitted an affidavit stating he did not give the respondent the requisite advisals. The June 8, 2010, decision of the Massachusetts Court (applicable Exhibit 7) belies the respondent’s claim that he was not advised. The Court decision cites the documentary evidence in the criminal case which establishes that he was so advised. On such basis, the respondent’s case does not come with the cope of Padilla v. Kentucky, supra. We find no basis to continue the respondent’s case during the pendency of the appeal of the criminal case.
 
*2 ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.

MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Eduardo Encinas, Esquire
 
ORDER:
 
*1 On May 8, 2002, the Board affirmed an Immigration Judge’s decision, in which the judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen removal proceedings, which were conducted in absentia.¿FN1º The respondent filed a late motion to reopen on February 24, 2010. Section 240(c)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the pending motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent seeks to have the Board reopen its decision, based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has not held in a published decision that filing deadlines before this Board may be equitably tolled. Indeed, in Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, 543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir. 2008), the court found that a request for equitable tolling was in effect a request that the Board exercise sua sponte authority over an untimely motion under at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a), and the court lacks jurisdiction to review a decision by the Board not to exercise this authority.
 
The Board declines to exercise its sua sponte authority over the pending untimely motion, as the respondent failed to exercise due diligence in filing the motion. There is no good reason provided for why this motion was filed over seven years after we dismissed the respondent’s appeal. The motion states that the respondent checked with “independent counsel” in 2008, and learned of the in absentia order in August, 2008 (Respondent’s Mot., at 3-4). Nevertheless, the pending motion was not filed with the Board until February 24, 2010.
 
The pending motion is, therefore, denied.

On May 28, 2010, the respondent filed the instant motion to reopen with the Board based on the alleged ineffectiveness of her prior counsel. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the motion. The respondent’s motion to reopen will be denied.
 
As an initial matter, the respondent’s timely motion to reopen now before us exceeds the numerical limitations for motions to reopen and will be denied. Under the law, with certain exceptions not pertinent here, a party is limited to one motion to reopen. Section 240(c)(7)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). However, as set out above, this is the respondent’s second motion to reopen as she previously filed a motion to reopen with the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2) (stating that a party may file only one motion to reopen “whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge ….”) (emphasis added). Consequently, the respondent’s motion to reopen is numerically barred.
 
We also reject the respondent’s contention that her motion to reopen should be granted based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Although the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has not squarely decided whether the number limit on motions to reopen can be equitably surmounted based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, it has found that the Board does not abuse its discretion in finding that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is insufficient where it fails to comply with requirements set forth in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). Lara v. Trominski, 216 F.3d 487 (5th Cir. 2000). As observed by DHS in this case, the affidavit submitted by the respondent does not set out the agreement and representations made by prior counsel and does not adequately explain why the respondent did not file a complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authority (see Respondent’s Motion to Reopen, Exhibit 3).
 
In addition, the respondent has not shown, as required, that she suffered “substantial prejudice” as a result of the ineffective representation. See Miranda-Lores v. INS, 17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th 1994). Proving prejudice requires a prima facie showing that had the cancellation application been filed, she would have been entitled to relief. See id. However, as pointed out by the Immigration Judge in denying the respondent’s first motion to reopen, the respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal because she has not submitted evidence indicating that a qualifying relative would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship upon her removal to Mexico. Consequently, even assuming arguendo the availability of equitable relief for a number-barred motion to reopen, we do not find that it is warranted. Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
 
*2 ORDER: The respondent’s motion to reopen is denied.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent’s motion for a stay is denied.

File: AXXX XX5 116 - New York, NY

IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
  
MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Albert Cohen, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Robert Bergida
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
 
*1 The respondent has filed a timely motion to reconsider the Board’s January 8, 2010, decision dismissing her appeal of an Immigration Judge’s denial of her motion to reopen proceedings in which she was ordered deported on August 23, 1995. The respondent also seeks a stay of deportation. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the motion, which will be denied.
 
The respondent’s motion alleges that the Board erred as it affirmed the Immigration Judge’s decision and “did not engage in substantial review” of that decision (Motion at 3). She asserts that the Board erroneously did not address the likelihood of success regarding her application for adjustment of status, and should have granted her motion as it was predicated on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, as both the Immigration Judge and this Board correctly noted, the respondent’s motion did not comply with the requirements for a claim of ineffective assistance as enumerated in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), aff’d 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The respondent does not contest this finding, which was fatal to her motion to reopen. As such, we find no error in the Board’s prior decision, and thus, reconsideration is not warranted. Matter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b).
 
To the extent that the respondent seeks to introduce new evidence reflecting recent efforts to comply with the Lozada requirements, this aspect of her motion is one seeking reopening and rescission, and is untimely and number barred. Section 242B(c)(3) of the Act. However, if the respondent had demonstrated substantial compliance with Lozada, and shown due diligence in pursuing the claim, the time limit could arguably be equitably tolled. While we recognize her efforts in this regard, the respondent has not substantially complied with these requirements. Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 409 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2005) (stating that an “alien who has failed to comply substantially with the Lozada requirements in her motion to reopen before the ¿Boardº forfeits her ineffective assistance of counsel claim in this Court”).
 
In her current, third untimely motion to reopen, the respondent now claims that she hired “Mr. Bosch” at “Function Inc.” in New York to represent her in “immigration proceedings” (Tab 3). The respondent asserts that she hired Mr. Bosch on the same day that she married her first husband, and he later helped her husband filed a visa petition on her behalf in September of that year (Tabs 3, 5). She avers that Mr. Bosch advised her to not attend her immigration hearing as he would “take care of this matter himself” (Tab 3). The respondent alleges that she at some unspecified time “later” learned she had been ordered deported in absentia. She also asserts she had contacted Mr. Bosch several times “during that period of time” and he claimed that her adjustment application was “in process.” The respondent alleges that when she “later” contacted Function Inc. she was told that Mr. Bosch had “disappeared.” She further asserts that she is uncertain whether he was an attorney.
 
*2 The respondent has not provided any evidence indicating that she has informed Mr. Bosch of the allegations against him, or filed a bar complaint with the appropriate authorities. While she claims that Functions Inc. stated that he had disappeared, she submitted nothing from this agency supporting this claim. The complaint filed with the “consumer complaint agency” does not satisfy the bar complaint requirement in Lozada as there is no evidence that it has any authority over members of the bar or persons who otherwise purport to provide immigration advice (Tab 4).¿FN1º Given her statement that she is uncertain whether Mr. Bosch is an attorney, no explanation has been offered as to whether she consulted the state bar authorities to ascertain his status, and why a complaint was not filed with bar authorities. The claims in her affidavit regarding the representational agreement she had with Mr. Bosch and her efforts to keep in touch with him are notable for their vagueness and generality.
 
As the Immigration Judge noted in denying her prior motion, the respondent received personal service of the charging document, which informed her of the time, date and location of her hearing, and of the consequences should she fail to appear (Exh. 1). She has not explained why she nonetheless took Mr. Bosch’s alleged advice to not appear despite those warnings. Given these various deficiencies, we find that the respondent has not substantially complied with the Lozada requirements, and her motion is not exempt from the applicable time limitation. See, e.g., Omar v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 647, 651 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding that the Board’s decision to deny the respondent’s ineffective assistance claim against a non-attorney immigration consultant based on non-compliance with Lozada was “neither arbitrary nor capricious”).
 
In addition, the respondent has not shown that she exercised the requisite due diligence in pursuing her claim. Cekic v. INS, 435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 2006) (“no matter how egregiously ineffective counsel’s assistance may have been, an alien will not be entitled to equitable tolling unless he can affirmatively demonstrate that he exercised reasonable due diligence during the time period sought to be tolled”); Iavorski v. INS, 232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir. 2000). This is further support for denial of reopening.
 
Finally, given this record, we do not find that the respondent has presented exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of our discretionary authority to sua sponte grant this untimely, number-barred motion to reopen. Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
 
*3 As we find no basis for granting reconsideration of our January 8, 2010, decision, or reopening of proceedings, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The respondent’s motion is denied.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
  
APPEAL
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
 
Stuart J. Snyder, Esquire
 
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Carrie E. Johnston
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Reopening
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Kenya, was ordered removed from the United States in absentia on June 3, 2009, after failing to appear at a hearing on that date. He filed a motion to reopen on July 22, 2009. The Immigration Judge denied it on September 25, 2009, and this appeal followed. The appeal will be sustained.
 
Under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3), the Board defers to the factual findings of an Immigration Judge, unless they are clearly erroneous, but it retains independent judgment and discretion, subject to applicable governing standards, regarding pure questions of law and the application of a particular standard of law to those facts. Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008). We decide this appeal de novo.
 
The respondent argues on appeal that “exceptional circumstances” prevented his appearance at the hearing. We consider the totality of the evidence in evaluating this issue. See Matter of J-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 33 (BIA 1998) and Matter of B-A-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 57 (BIA 1998). See also generally Kaweesa v. Gonzales, 450 F.3d 62, 68-69 (1st Cir. 2006) (including the strength of the alien’s underlying claim); Romero-Morales v. INS, 25 F.3d 125, 129-31 (2d Cir. 1994); Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, 298 F.3d 888 (9th Cir. 2002).
 
Here, we consider that the record contains a statement from the respondent’s former attorney. Therein, counsel admits that she erroneously instructed the respondent to appear for his hearing on June 9, 2009, rather than the correct date of June 3, 2009. The respondent’s declaration corroborates his attorney’s account. In addition, we consider that the respondent filed his motion to reopen almost immediately after learning that he was ordered removed from the United States in absentia. His due diligence in this matter is strong evidence of the respondent’s lack of intention to miss his hearing. We also consider that the respondent appeared at numerous previous hearings since 2007. Further, a clear and obvious case of ineffective assistance of counsel is present and the respondent has substantially complied with the requirements of Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). See generally Castillo-Perez v. INS, 212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir. 2000). It appears that the respondent’s failure to appear at his hearing was caused by an errant instruction from his former counsel.
 
*2 We find based on the totality of the evidence that the respondent has established that reopening of these proceedings based on “exceptional circumstances” is appropriate. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and these proceedings are reopened and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.

APPEAL AND MOTION
 
 
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
  
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
 
Sarah C. Schreck
Assistant Chief Counsel
 
APPLICATION: Termination; remand
 
*1 The respondent, a native and citizen of Canada, appeals from an Immigration Judge’s November 5, 2009, decision finding him removable as charged and ordering him removed to Canada. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has filed an opposition brief. The appeal will be dismissed. While this matter was on appeal, the respondent filed what the Board construes to be a motion to remand. This motion will be denied.
 
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of H-L-H- & Z-Y-Z-, 25 I&N Dec. 209, 211 (BIA 2010).
 
The respondent, a citizen and native of Canada, was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1967 (Exh. 1; I.J at 1). On February 14, 2007, in the Circuit Court of Marion County, State of Oregon, he pled guilty to the offense of burglary in the first degree, in violation of section 164.225 of the Oregon Revised Statutes, and he was sentenced to 19 months confinement (Exh. 2, Tab B at 1; I.J. at 1). In his decision, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was convicted of a theft or burglary offense for which a term of imprisonment of at least 1 year was imposed, thus constituting an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(G).
 
The respondent argues that his criminal conviction was invalid because he received ineffective assistance from a prior criminal counsel, who allegedly failed to inform him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea (Respondent’s Notice of Appeal at 4). Although the respondent is apparently appealing a Circuit Court denial of post-conviction relief to the Supreme Court of the State of Oregon, to date the record does not reflect that the conviction has actually been overturned. Thus, his pending collateral attack on his conviction does not affect its finality for federal immigration purposes, or warrant a continuance. Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506, 508 (BIA 1992).
 
In a letter associated with the record in April 2010, the respondent’s former immigration counsel appeared to reference Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 2010 WL 1222274 (March 31, 2010), in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that a lawyer representing an alien in connection with a guilty plea to a criminal offense has a constitutional duty to advise the alien about the risk of deportation arising from the conviction. However, any suggestion that the respondent’s conviction might be invalid in light of Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, does not change its finality for immigration purposes of such conviction, unless and until it is in fact overturned or materially amended. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996); Matter of Madrigal, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996).
 
*2 On appeal, the respondent alleged that he was ill served by the failure of his prior immigration counsel to seek cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, and he requested a remand so that the Immigration Judge could consider this application in the first instance (Respondent’s Br. at 1-2, 9). We construe the respondent’s submissions in this regard as a motion to remand and reopen his proceedings. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(4).
 
However, the respondent has not complied with the procedural requirements for raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. That is, he has not submitted an affidavit detailing the agreement he had with his prior counsel, asserted that the prior counsel had been informed of any allegations leveled against him and been given an opportunity to respond, or confirmed that disciplinary complaints had been filed against the prior counsel. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). His actions to date could not even be construed as substantial compliance. See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, 339 F.3d 814, 825-26 (9th Cir. 2003) (recognizing substantial compliance with Lozada procedural requirements where legitimacy of the claim is plain on the face of the administrative record).
 
Finally, a motion to reopen will not be granted unless it establishes a prima facie case of statutory and discretionary eligibility for the underlying substantive relief sought. See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). Since the respondent’s aggravated felony conviction thus far remains intact, he has not shown that he is statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal. See section 240A(a)(3) of the Act. Therefore, he has not established that he was prejudiced by the apparent failure of his prior immigration counsel to file an application for cancellation of removal. Matter of Assaad, 23 I&N Dec. 553, 556 (BIA 2003); Ahmed v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 768, 772 (9th Cir. 2008).
 
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied.

Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act ¿8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)º - Convicted of controlled substance violation
  
APPLICATION: Termination, reopening
 
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican Republic and a lawful permanent resident of the United States since his admission as an immigrant on or about November 27, 1991, has filed a timely appeal from an Immigration Judge’s May 10, 2010, decision. In that decision, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable, as charged, based on his admissions (Tr. at 5-6), and concessions of removability (Tr. at 6), and statutorily ineligible for relief from removal, including cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3), on account of the respondent’s 2009 New York conviction for Criminal Sale of Marijuana in the fourth degree, in violation of NY PENAL LAW § 221.40. In addition, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to terminate based on the respondent’s contention that the order by a New York court granting the respondent’s motion to file an untimely notice of appeal undermined the finality of the controlled substance conviction underlying these proceedings. The respondent’s appeal will be dismissed. The respondent’s request to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is granted under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.8(a)(3). See Matter of Chicas, 19 I&N Dec. 114 (BIA 1984).
 
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge’s findings of fact, including findings as to the credibility of testimony, under the “clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629 (BIA 2003); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in an appeal from an Immigration Judge’s decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); Matter of V-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 500 (BIA 2008) rev’d on other grounds, Kaplun v. Attorney General of the United States, 602 F.3d 260 (3d Cir. 2010); Matter of A-S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
 
*2 At the outset, we address the respondent’s motion, styled as a motion to reopen and reconsider, that was filed contemporaneously with his Notice of Appeal (form EOIR-26), alleging due process violations in the Immigration Judge’s conduct of these proceedings. We have held an alien must demonstrate that he has been prejudiced by a violation of a procedural rule or regulation before his deportation proceeding will be invalidated. Matter of Garcia-Flores, 17 I&N Dec. 325, 329 (BIA 1980). This is consistent with the rule that an alien must have been prejudiced by a procedural defect in his deportation proceeding before he will be found to have suffered a denial of due process. See Ka Fung Chan v. INS, 634 F.2d 248, 258 (5th Cir. 1981). In the matter before us, no such prejudice has been shown. Moreover, the record reflects that the respondent had ample opportunity to prepare for and address the removal charges, and eligibility for relief from removal.
 
Although the respondent declined to accept the Immigration Judge’s offer to continue the proceedings in order to secure legal representation (Tr. at 5), the Immigration Judge nevertheless continued the proceedings on several occasions for that purpose (Tr. at 7-8, 9-11).¿FN1º Nonetheless, the record reflects that the respondent freely admitted that he had suffered a 2009 New York conviction for Criminal Sale of Marijuana in the Fourth Degree, in violation of NY PENAL LAW § 221.40, as alleged in the Notice to Appear (“NTA”) (form I-862) (Exh. 1) (Tr. at 5-6). In addition, the respondent conceded that as a result of this 2009 New York drug-trafficking conviction, he was also subject to removability as charged in the NTA (Tr. at 6). Thus, notwithstanding the respondent’s appellate contentions, we consider that the respondent’s removability is not at issue. The distinct and formal admissions, made by respondent during his removal hearing, are binding on the respondent as judicial admissions, and he will not now be heard to challenge the factual findings or legal conclusions of the Immigration Judge that arose from those admissions. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c). See also Matter of Velasquez, 19 I&N Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986); cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(B) (authorizing summary dismissal of appeals when “¿tºhe only reason for the appeal specified by the party concerned involves a finding of fact or a conclusion of law that was conceded by that party at a prior proceeding”); see generally Pool Co. v. Cooper, 274 F.3d 173, 185 (5th Cir. 2001) (finding that the court was entitled to treat a concession as a binding judicial admission of fact.); Martinez v. Bally’s Louisiana, Inc., 244 F.3d 474 (5th Cir. 2001) (a judicial admission is conclusive, unless the court allows it to be withdrawn).
 
*3 Moreover, like the Immigration Judge, we conclude that the respondent’s 2009 New York controlled substance offense is an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B). According to the United States Supreme Court, a state drug offense qualifies as a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and, by extension, an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act if the offense would have been punishable as a felony under the Federal Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), 21 U.S.C. § 802 et seq. See Lopez v. Gonzales, 127 S. Ct. 625, 630-31 (2006). The New York offense of criminal sale of marijuana is comparable to the federal offense of marijuana distribution, which is punishable under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D) by a term of imprisonment of up to 5 years, making it a federal “felony.”¿FN2º Id., at 631 n.7 (holding that “for purposes of § 924(c)(2) the crimes the CSA defines as ‘felonies’ are those crimes to which it assigns a punishment exceeding one year’s imprisonment.”); see also Matter of Aruna, 24 I&N Dec. 452, 456-57 (BIA 2008) (citing United States v. Walker, 302 F.3d 322, 324-25 (5th Cir. 2002)); compare NY PENAL LAW § 221.35 (criminalizing the sale of 2 grams or less of marijuana for “no consideration”). Although the record does not show whether this “sale” by the respondent included an exchange of funds or were non-remunerative transfers, this fact does not benefit the respondent because all such transfers are encompassed within the meaning of the term “distribute” as employed in 21 U.S.C. § 84(a)(1). See 21 U.S.C. §§ 802(8), (11); see also United States v. Workopich, 479 F.2d 1142, 1147 n.6 (5th Cir. 1973). Accordingly, the respondent’s 2009 New York State conviction for criminal sale of marijuana would be punishable as a federal felony even if the conviction record did not reflect that he transferred marijuana in exchange for money or other consideration.
 
Furthermore, contrary to the respondent’s appellate contention, his 2009 New York controlled substance conviction is not under direct appeal. Rather, according to the documentation he has presented accompanying the appeal, he has been granted permission by the New York criminal court to file an untimely notice of appeal in his criminal case alleging ineffective assistance from criminal counsel. See Respondent’s Appeal Brief at Exh. C. However, the respondent has submitted no evidence that any post-conviction document has been filed pursuant to that order. See Respondent’s Appeal Brief at Exh. E.
 
*4 Thus, to the extent that the respondent’s arguments are in the nature of collateral attacks on his conviction, they are not properly before us for consideration, as neither the Immigration Judge nor this Board can entertain a collateral attack on a judgment of conviction unless that judgment is void on its face, and cannot go behind the judicial record to determine the guilt or innocence of the respondent. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I&N Dec. 323, 327 (BIA 1996); Matter of Rodriguez-Carrillo, 22 I&N Dec. 1031, 1034 (BIA 1999). Further, the fact that the respondent may be pursuing post-conviction relief in the form of a collateral attack on a conviction in criminal court does not affect its finality for federal immigration purposes. See Matter of Adetiba, 20 I&N Dec. 506 (BIA 1992). The respondent had (and has) a valid “conviction” for immigration purposes, and his collateral attack upon that conviction does not operate to negate its validity until it is in fact overturned or materially amended. See Matter of Madrigal-Calvo, supra, at 327; see also Singh v. Holder, 568 F.3d 525, 528 (5th Cir. 2009) (citing Zinnanti v. INS, 651 F.2d 420, 421 (5th Cir. 1981) (“Once the ¿state criminalº conviction becomes final, it provides a valid basis for deportation unless it is overturned in a judicial post-conviction proceeding.”).
 
The respondent has presented no new evidence on appeal to indicate that his 2009 New York controlled substance conviction underlying these removal proceedings, has been overturned, vacated, or expunged; rather, the evidence merely indicates that the respondent has been granted permission by the New York court to file an untimely notice of appeal of that conviction, which has yet to be perfected. See Respondent’s Appeal Brief at Exh. E.
 
We acknowledge the Supreme Court’s recent decision of Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.Ct. 1473 (2010), in which the court ruled that a lawyer representing an alien in connection with a guilty plea to a criminal offense has a constitutional duty to advise the alien about the risk of deportation arising from the conviction. Notwithstanding, any speculation that the respondent’s 2009 New York controlled substance conviction might be invalid on this basis, including in light of Padilla v. Kentucky, supra, does not change the finality for immigration purposes of such conviction, unless and until it were to be overturned by a criminal court. See Matter of Ponce de Leon, 21 I&N Dec. 154 (A.G. 1997; BIA 1997, 1996).
 
Thus, we are not persuaded to disturb the Immigration Judge’s conclusion that the respondent is removable based on his admissions (Tr. at 5-6) and concession of removability (Tr. at 6). See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c). Moreover, having expressed no fear of persecution or torture if returned to the Dominican Republic (Tr. at 6), the respondent has failed to establish his eligibility for any relief from removal, including cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(a)(3) of the Act. See section 240(c)(4)(A)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(A)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d).
 
*5 Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
 
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
 
FURTHER ORDER: The motion is denied.

Although the respondent, in his motion, raises allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, the record fails to disclose that the respondent was ever represented by legal counsel during the course of the proceedings before the Immigration Judge. We note, parenthetically, the respondent is currently represented by legal counsel on appeal, and the allegations raised in the motion are not directed at present counsel.

In this regard, we find the respondent’s reliance on the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the jurisdiction wherein this case arises, in Smith v. Gonzales, 468 F.3d 272 (5th Cir. 2006), to be misplaced. In that case, which was decided prior to the Supreme Court’s decision in Lopez v. Gonzales, the court found that the New York offense of Criminal Sale of Marijuana in the Fourth Degree, in violation of NY PENAL LAW § 221.40, did not qualify as a drug trafficking crime that could be punishable as a felony under the CSA, based on the recidivist sentencing enhancement provision found in 21 U.S.C. § 844(a). Id. at 276-77. Here, however, we find the analogous federal felony statute under the CSA to be marijuana distribution, which is punishable under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(D). Thus, the “aggravated felony” felony issue based on recidivist possession, addressed by the Fifth Circuit in Smith v. Gonzales, supra, is not controlling.
